"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is close to Bob's maximum price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1080000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking to get out of the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of getting an even better deal open.  Bob can potentially get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,080,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,060,000?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1070000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking to get out of the deal. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is only $70,000 higher than what Bob can get from John. There are only 5 rounds left, and it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price.  It's better to accept the offer now and save the risk of losing the deal completely."
