# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $140. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can get the product from John for $150, so you have room to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $135, which is still a good price for you considering you can get it from John for $150.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
