"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $170. Let's meet in the middle.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is just not going to work for me. I'm willing to drop the price to $155. This is my final offer.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120 for it. Let's see if we can close the deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
