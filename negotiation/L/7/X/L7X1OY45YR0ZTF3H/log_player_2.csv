"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice, as he's willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.  A counteroffer will give Alice an incentive to lower the price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $890,000? This price reflects the value it brings while still providing you with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $890,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice, as the product is worth $800,000 to her.  He can continue to push for a lower price, aiming for something closer to $850,000."
