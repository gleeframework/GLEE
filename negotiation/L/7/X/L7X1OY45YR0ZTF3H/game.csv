"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $890,000? This price reflects the value it brings while still providing you with a good deal.",890000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $890,000 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference at $870,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a profit and me a good deal. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for everyone.",870000.0,Bob,4,
