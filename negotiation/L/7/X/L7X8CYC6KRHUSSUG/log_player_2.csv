# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000. I believe this is still a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my desired price point. It's a step in the right direction, but there's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
