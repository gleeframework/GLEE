``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100. While this is a good deal, you can likely get it for even less by negotiating.  You'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $90? I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
