"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but higher than her product's value. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling my interest in a deal.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone encourages a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Target Price:** My goal is to get the product for under $100, ideally closer to $80. This counteroffer is a step in that direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, considering what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a little further.  There's a chance she might accept $90, which would be a good deal for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, $95 is closer to what I had in mind.  Would you do $90? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** I'm meeting Alice halfway between her counteroffer ($95) and my previous offer ($85). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""I'm ready to buy if you agree"", I'm adding a bit of urgency, hoping to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Fairness:** $90 is a price that gives Alice a decent profit while still saving me money compared to John's offer."
