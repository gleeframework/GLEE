"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to let you know that I'm looking to sell it for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still only able to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a successful deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,050,000. Let's try to meet in the middle again. Can we discuss a price of $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,025,000. Let's try to meet in the middle again. Can we discuss a price of $987,500?",987500.0,Alice,7,
