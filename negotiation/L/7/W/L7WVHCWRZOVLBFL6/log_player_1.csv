Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum desired value.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not going to settle for that low of an offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm offering a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum desired price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower and is now below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offers are becoming too far apart from my desired price. It's best to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John to ensure I reach my goal."
