"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'm comfortable with a price of $1,050,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from. While $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price significantly below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a sure thing and avoids further negotiation."
