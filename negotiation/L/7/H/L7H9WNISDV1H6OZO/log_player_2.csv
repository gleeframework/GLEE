Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come out ahead. Let's finalize this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, but $1,300,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,310,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,330,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000.
