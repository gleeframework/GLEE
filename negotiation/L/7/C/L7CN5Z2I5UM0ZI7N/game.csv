"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm looking to save as much money as possible, so I'm willing to make a lower offer. How about $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to save money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500, so I'll make an offer of $9750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I've already given you a good deal. I can offer you the product for $10250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
