Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, leaving room for him to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's a strong starting position:** It shows you're confident in the value of your product while still being open to negotiation.

If Bob rejects, you can analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind your minimum price and the potential deal with John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is still a good profit, I'm not in a rush to sell. Bob is clearly interested and willing to pay a premium, so there's room for further negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasize the value of the product. I'll aim for a price slightly above $1,100,000, perhaps $1,125,000 or $1,130,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,080,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price slightly above $1,080,000, perhaps $1,090,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes the value of the product to me.

However, I'll also keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind. If Bob doesn't come closer to my price, I might decide to take John's offer to avoid further negotiation."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to go a bit lower, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,070,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,070,000 is very close to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  I've already made several concessions, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better price. 

**Decision:**

I've reached a point where I'm better off taking John's offer of $1,000,000. While it's not ideal, it guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which may not lead to a more favorable outcome."
