"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $1,200,000 is below what I can accept. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
