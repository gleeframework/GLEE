Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He'll only accept an offer at or below that price.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This makes negotiation tricky.

**Strategies**

Since there's no apparent room for a mutually beneficial deal, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor, Hope for the Best:**  You could start with a high offer (significantly above $1,500,000) hoping Bob might be willing to pay more than his perceived value. This is risky, as he's likely to reject it outright.

2. **Stick with John:** Given the circumstances, the most logical approach is to forgo negotiations with Bob and sell to John. You're guaranteed your minimum price.

**The Offer (Not recommended, but an example if you want to try for a higher price):**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product at a premium price of $1,700,000.  I believe its value far exceeds this, and this offer reflects its unique nature."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* This offer is a gamble. It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it leaves room for him to counter-offer. 
* You'll need to be prepared to walk away if he rejects it or offers significantly less than $1,500,000.

**The Best Course of Action:**

Realistically, you should sell to John.  Attempting to negotiate with Bob in this scenario has a high chance of failure and could result in a missed opportunity with John."
