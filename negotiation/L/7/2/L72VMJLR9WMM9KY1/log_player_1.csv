{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special discounted price of $9,500. I think it would be very valuable to you, but if you're not interested at this price, I do have another buyer lined up."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $10,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $9,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still a ""good deal"" compared to him missing out and me selling it for $10,000.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer subtly pressures Bob to act quickly and consider the offer more seriously. 

This offer aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still making the offer appealing enough for him to accept."
