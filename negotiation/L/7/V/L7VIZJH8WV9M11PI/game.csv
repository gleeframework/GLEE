"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  Is that something you'd be interested in?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing that we're both committed to finding a solution.  Let's try $10,500. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
