"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $13,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $17,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I can go up to $14,500, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  Bob is very slowly increasing his offer, and we're still below John's offer. It's unlikely Bob will reach $15,000 in a reasonable number of rounds. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
