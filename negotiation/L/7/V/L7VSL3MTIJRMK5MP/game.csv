"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $13,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $17,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I can go up to $14,500, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14500.0,Bob,4,
