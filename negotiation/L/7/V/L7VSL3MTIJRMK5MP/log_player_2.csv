"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $13,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $17,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point, $17,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price he's comfortable with. Buying from John is still an option, but Bob should explore if he can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I can go up to $14,500, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14500}
