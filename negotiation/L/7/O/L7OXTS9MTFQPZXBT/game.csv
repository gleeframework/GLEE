"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is $800,000.  I'm willing to pay that price if you're open to it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $800,000. If you're open to it, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my target price.  Let's try $975,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $850,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and is the absolute maximum I can offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. It seems we're getting closer. How about this:  $925,000 and we have a deal. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain from this product.",925000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000. If you can meet me there, we can finalize the deal.  I'm confident this product will be valuable for both of us, so let's find a way to make it work.",875000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate how persistent you are, and I want to see us close this deal. My final offer is $900,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's more than fair for both of us. What do you say, shall we shake on it?",900000.0,Alice,9,
