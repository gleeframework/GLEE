"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a profit.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $11,750? That's a fair compromise between our two offers.",11750.0,Bob,4,
