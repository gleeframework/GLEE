"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning the product. Let's try to find some common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll gain. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
