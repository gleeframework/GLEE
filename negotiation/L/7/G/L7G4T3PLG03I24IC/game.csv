"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply not enough.  The product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm going to need at least $1,200,000 to make this work. Let's keep the negotiations going.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I also have a minimum price I need to meet.  Let's try $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $1,080,000?  This is a strong offer, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find common ground. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,125,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 as my final offer. It's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it at this price.  Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make a final concession and meet you at $1,110,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. I hope you'll accept it, as this is my last offer before I have to consider other options.",1110000.0,Alice,9,
