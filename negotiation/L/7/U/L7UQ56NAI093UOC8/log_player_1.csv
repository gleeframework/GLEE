Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:** The price is well below what the product is worth to him.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit.  If Bob rejects, you'll have to assess if it's worth continuing to negotiate or selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in your product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent profit, it's still below what you could potentially get from Bob. You have room to negotiate higher.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Keeping the profit margin:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum value of $8,000.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, hopefully leading to a successful negotiation."
