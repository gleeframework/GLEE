I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be interested in the product, and this price gives him some room to bargain without making me feel like I'm losing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see that this price is reasonable and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his price.  While I would prefer a higher price,  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000."
