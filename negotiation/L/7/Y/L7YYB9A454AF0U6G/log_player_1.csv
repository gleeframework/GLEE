Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's clear he won't meet my minimum acceptable price. I've already lost two rounds and there's no guarantee he will change his mind. It's best to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
