"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you. My initial offer is $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's offer is too high. We have room to go down before reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. Could you do $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:** I want to signal that I'm serious about buying but looking for a significant discount. Starting with an offer closer to John's price puts pressure on Alice while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Move:** By offering $1,025,000, I have space to increase my offer in future rounds if needed without going over my $1,000,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,025,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice is moving closer to a price I might accept, $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Maintain Pressure:** Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to make further concessions. We're getting closer to a deal, but I want to see how much lower she's willing to go."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to, but $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Incremental Increases:** I'm increasing my offer in smaller increments now ($25,000) to show Alice I'm willing to move towards a deal, but I'm not going to give in easily.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer is a good way to gauge Alice's flexibility. If she rejects it, we're getting very close to the point where John's offer becomes the more appealing option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,075,000.  This is a very fair price and I think it represents good value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $1,075,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's more than John's offer, it's close enough to my $1,000,000 limit that the potential time and effort saved by securing the deal now outweighs the extra cost.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Alice might not go much lower, and I risk jeopardizing the deal altogether, forcing me to go with John's offer anyway."
