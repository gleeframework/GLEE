{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's probably a good idea to take the deal. It's only $1 over our target price, and we're getting closer to the end of our negotiation rounds.  There's a risk that if we reject this offer, we might not be able to get a better deal from Alice, and then we'll have to buy from John at a higher price."
