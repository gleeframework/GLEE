"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have John as a backup option for $1,000,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, getting you a better deal."
