,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate the opportunity, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. It's a fair price, considering what I'm willing to pay. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again and sell the product to you for $102. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $102 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $98, which is a fair price considering your previous offers. I hope we can reach an agreement.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $102 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100.50, which is the lowest I can go without losing money. I hope you can understand my position.",100.5,Alice,7,
