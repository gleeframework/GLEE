"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My next offer is $920,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we both deserve a fair deal here. Let's split the difference - $885,000. This shows I'm serious about buying, and it's a price I feel comfortable with.",885000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $885,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $885,000, so my next offer is $902,500. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price.",902500.0,Alice,7,
