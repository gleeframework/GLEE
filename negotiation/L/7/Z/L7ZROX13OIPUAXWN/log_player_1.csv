Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?

Bob's offer is too low, but I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $9,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good value for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's final offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price. I'm confident that John will buy the product at my desired price. I don't want to risk losing a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
