"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,200,000 for this product.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy the product from another seller at that price. Let me know if you're interested.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  I'll accept $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our needs.  If you're serious about purchasing the product, this is our final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
