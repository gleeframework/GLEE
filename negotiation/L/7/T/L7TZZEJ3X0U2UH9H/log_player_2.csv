{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your target price of $1,500,000.  You should reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price. There are 10 rounds, so you have plenty of time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for negotiation.  I'm aiming to find a price within my budget and hopefully close the deal quickly."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still higher than my ideal. I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price. With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate further without resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price below $1,000,000.  I'm hoping this signals my seriousness while remaining within my budget.  We're halfway through the negotiation, and it's time to start closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a lower price. We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation, and I have time to continue bargaining.  Buying from John at this point would cost significantly more, so continuing with Alice is the better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again increasing my offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.  However, I'm still staying within my budget and aiming for a price that benefits both of us.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm hoping this offer will be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer, which is above my target price. While we are nearing the end of the negotiation, there are still a few rounds left to get a better deal. Buying from John now would cost me more than I'm willing to spend, so I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, I'm making a final push for a price close to my budget.  I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise but still aiming for a price that's lower than Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping this will convince Alice to accept, as it's a win-win situation for both of us.  If Alice rejects, I'll have no choice but to buy from John, as it would be the last round."
