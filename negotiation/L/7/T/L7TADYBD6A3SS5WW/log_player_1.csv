Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a bit of a gamble. It's high enough to make Bob think about it, but still leaves room for me to make a decent profit. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Any price below that gives him a profit.
* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000, as that's what John will pay.
* **Negotiation:**  A price of $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer.

If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer and still be happy with the outcome."
