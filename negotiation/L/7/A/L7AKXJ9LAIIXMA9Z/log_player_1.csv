Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product for $1,150,000. It's a significant opportunity, and I believe the value it brings you justifies this price. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable outcome."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with him.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would secure a decent profit, but it's not the best outcome. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to reduce the price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the significant value this product brings. I hope you'll find this counteroffer acceptable."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1000000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now equal to John's offer. This is a good deal for me, as it meets my minimum desired profit. Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation rounds and ensures a secure sale."
