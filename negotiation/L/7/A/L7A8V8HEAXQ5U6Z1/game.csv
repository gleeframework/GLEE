"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product holds value for me, but closer to $1,000,000.  How about we bring it down significantly to  $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the product's value. While $1,100,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,650,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $1,250,000. I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value to both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While $1,250,000 isn't feasible for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a fair deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your movement, but the gap is still significant. To make this work, I need to be closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've both invested significant time in this negotiation, and I want to be upfront. My absolute lowest price for this product is $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its true value. Please let me know if this works for you, as I need to consider other options if we can't reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
