Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've both invested significant time in this negotiation, and I want to be upfront. My absolute lowest price for this product is $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its true value. Please let me know if this works for you, as I need to consider other options if we can't reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her absolute lowest price is $1,500,000. This exceeds your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a price you find acceptable.  Therefore, the best option is to buy from John at your target price."
