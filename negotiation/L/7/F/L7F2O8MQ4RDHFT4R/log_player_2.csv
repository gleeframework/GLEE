# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I can do $1,700,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,700,000, which is $1,550,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,500,000 than risk Alice not budging further."
