"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away happy with this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  If you're open to that price, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I may have to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,4,
