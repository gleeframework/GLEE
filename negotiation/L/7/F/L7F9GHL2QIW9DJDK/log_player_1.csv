Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Knowing how much value it could bring to your operations, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit, Minimize Risk:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 aims to capture the majority of the value difference ($300,000) between what Bob values it at and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-propose if he wants to negotiate further.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to buy the product at your minimum price ($1,200,000) provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond the provided valuations."
