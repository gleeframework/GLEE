Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's the best I can do.

It's clear that Alice is not going to budge closer to your $8,000 limit.  She's gone up from her previous offer, indicating she's getting further from a reasonable compromise.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
