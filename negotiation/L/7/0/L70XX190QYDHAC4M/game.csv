"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the potential of the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than your initial price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference on our last offers. I'll go up to $1,237,500. It's a fair price, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",1237500.0,Bob,4,
