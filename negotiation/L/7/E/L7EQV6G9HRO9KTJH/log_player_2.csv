"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $10,250. This means Bob is still getting a good deal, saving $1,750.
* **Negotiation:** While further negotiation could potentially lead to a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and running out of rounds is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price.
* **John:** Buying from John for $12,000 is not a good option compared to Alice's offer."
