"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product for $12,000 when you have another option to get it for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation. We'll see if she's willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject it and see if we can get closer to a deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm raising my counteroffer to $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  Hopefully, this shows my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  At this point, it's better to just buy the product from John for $10,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down to a price I'm comfortable with, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds."
