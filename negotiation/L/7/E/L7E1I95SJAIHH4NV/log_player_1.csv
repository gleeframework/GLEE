"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's unlikely Bob will accept on the first round. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to potentially lower the price in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but not by much. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. There are several rounds left and I don't want to settle too quickly.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob in the hopes of getting a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a good compromise and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and I'm happy to secure the sale with him. There are still several rounds left, but the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price, or even losing the deal entirely, is greater than the potential reward of trying to get a higher price."
