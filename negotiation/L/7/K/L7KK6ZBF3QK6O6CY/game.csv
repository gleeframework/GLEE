"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $14,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could let it go for $15,500. This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $14,000. I'm confident we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
