"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,800.  This is a fair compromise and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,900. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",12900.0,Alice,5,
