"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we value this product at $1,200,000, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe a price of $700,000 would be more reflective of a fair deal. What are your thoughts on this?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $850,000 is closer, I think we can still find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $800,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
