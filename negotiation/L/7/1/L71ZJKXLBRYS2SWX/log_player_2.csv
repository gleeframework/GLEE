"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity. Our product, which I believe holds immense value for you, is now available for consideration. Given its significance and the unique benefits it offers, I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000. My proposal aims to bridge the gap between our respective valuations while maximizing the value I receive for this exceptional item.

I am offering to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a strategic compromise that allows us both to achieve our financial objectives. By accepting this offer, you would be securing a remarkable asset at a price that is still significantly higher than its market value, providing you with a substantial return on investment.

Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I am confident that together, we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Best regards,
Alice

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  You know you have John as a backup option. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or simply purchase it from John and save a considerable amount of money."
