,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $110. I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle at $112? I'm still eager to buy this product, but  $113 is a bit out of my budget. ",112.0,Bob,8,
