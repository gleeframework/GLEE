"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is a good start, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is closer, but still a bit high.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $10,750.  If we can settle here, I'm ready to make the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,875?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $10,875 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's stick with my previous offer of $10,750.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal today.",10750.0,Bob,6,
