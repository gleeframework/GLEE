{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for bargaining. I'm aiming for a win-win situation, where Bob gets a good deal, and I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to offer you $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $15,500. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you, and I'm sure we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a good deal for me, and it seems like we're both close to an agreement. Accepting this offer will allow me to close the deal without further negotiation."
