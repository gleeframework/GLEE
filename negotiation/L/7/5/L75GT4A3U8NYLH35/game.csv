"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to offer you $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $15,500. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you, and I'm sure we can close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
