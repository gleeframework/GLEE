"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000? How about $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,200 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,400? That's a fair compromise.",10400.0,Bob,4,
