I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."

We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are getting tedious, and the offers are not getting closer to my desired price. To avoid the risk of losing more time and potentially getting an even lower offer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This is a safe and secure option, guaranteeing me my minimum desired value."
