Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,950,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we're already significantly above John's offer. Accepting $1,950,000 secures a substantial profit."
