"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is far below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This is to show some flexibility, but also to make sure I don't sell the product for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'll see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $110. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, and I think this price is more reasonable given Bob's previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can push Bob higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $105. I want to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I also need to make sure I'm not selling the product for too low of a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob is still not willing to budge much. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to Bob for $100."
