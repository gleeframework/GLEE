Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and Alice can potentially still meet her minimum price.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having a safety net in John's offer."
