"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price, and a counteroffer is the best way to try and achieve that."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he would prefer a lower price, $11,250 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  He's saving $750."
