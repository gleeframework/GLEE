"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is closer, I'm still a bit high. Let's meet at $100. This is a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my budget. ",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise.  However, I'm still sticking to my budget of $100. I think it's a fair price for both of us. ",100.0,Bob,6,
