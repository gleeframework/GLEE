"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,350,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You're still saving money:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000), you're still saving $150,000 compared to buying from John."
