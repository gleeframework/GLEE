Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying well above our minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing we have John willing to pay $800,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to accept anything below that. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  We can adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
