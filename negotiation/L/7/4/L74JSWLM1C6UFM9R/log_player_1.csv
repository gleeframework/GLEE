Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point to maximize my potential profit. I'm confident Bob will be interested since the product is worth $15,000 to him, and this offer is still within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to maximize my profit, $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is still a good price for Bob, considering the product's value to him, and it's closer to my ideal selling price. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to continue negotiating with him and risk losing out on a guaranteed $15,000 from John. I'm going to sell the product to John."
