"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less. It's worth $120 to you, and you're already saving $10 by considering Alice's offer.  You can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $105, which is a good deal for you.  It's still below your maximum value of $120, and you're saving a good amount compared to buying from John."
