"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, appealing to Bob's potential gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open and invites Bob's input, encouraging a collaborative negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, we're still early in the negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  See if he's willing to move closer to our desired price range.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  Avoid appearing overly eager to accept the first counteroffer.
* **Leverage John's Offer:**  We have the security of John's $1,200,000 offer, giving us room to negotiate strategically with Bob. 

We'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving but still targets a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I've considered your perspective, and to find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. "",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer ($62,500) to show flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement.
* **Maintaining Value:**  We're still aiming for a price well above Bob's offer and closer to our initial target, emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing it as finding a ""middle ground,"" we're promoting a collaborative approach and seeking a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,375,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant gain over our guaranteed sale to John ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Holding out for a slightly higher price might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further adds uncertainty and delays receiving payment. It's generally better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a marginally better one later."
