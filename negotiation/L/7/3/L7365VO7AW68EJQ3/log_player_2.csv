"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'd get great use out of it. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, you know John is willing to sell it for $12,000.  There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for your ideal price from John."
