Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, $10,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $12,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11,250. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,250 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, but if I don't get a better offer soon, I might consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your point about needing to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet at $11,750.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,500 is close to my minimum price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, and I'm only willing to sell to John as a last resort."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. I'm proposing a final price of $11,625. This is a reasonable compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11625}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11,625 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, but if not, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, we've reached a stalemate, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price.  Selling to John will still guarantee me a profit, so it's the best decision at this point."
