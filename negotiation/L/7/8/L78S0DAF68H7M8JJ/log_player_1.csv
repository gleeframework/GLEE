Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for closer to $10,000.  I know you're looking to get $15,000 for it, so this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still committed to getting this product, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us.
