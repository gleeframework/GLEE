Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so starting closer to that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. This avoids immediately anchoring the price too low.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value provides Bob with a reason for the price, making it more palatable than a bare number. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message encourages Bob's response, giving you insight into his willingness to negotiate. This helps you decide if you should lower the price or move on to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower initial offer could speed up the process.
 
This strategy balances ambition with the flexibility to secure a deal that is significantly more profitable than your guaranteed offer from John."
