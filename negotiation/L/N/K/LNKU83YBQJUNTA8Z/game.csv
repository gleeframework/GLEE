"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $17000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14500? That's the highest I can go.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14500 is simply too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle at $15750?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still staying within your budget.",15750.0,Alice,5,
