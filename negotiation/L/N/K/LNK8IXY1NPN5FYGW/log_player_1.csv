Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it ahead of others who would be highly interested."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value and Scarcity:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusive nature of this offer, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
