"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  I can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer."

How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would still be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go quite that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, which would be $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for both of you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on price, but I still think I can get it for lower.  I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,130,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being firm on the price.  While I'd love to get it lower, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer again or the deal falling through altogether is too high. At $1,130,000, I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's time to accept and close the deal."
