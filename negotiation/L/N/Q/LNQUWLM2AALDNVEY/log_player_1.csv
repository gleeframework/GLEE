Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is fair given my assessment of its worth and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
