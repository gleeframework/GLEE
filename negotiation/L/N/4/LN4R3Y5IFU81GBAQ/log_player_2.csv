"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While $110 is more than the product's worth to Alice, it's still less than what you'd pay John.
* **You're getting a deal:**  You're saving $10 compared to buying from John."
