"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a special price of $9,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get this valuable item at a discounted rate. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Since you can buy the product for $8,000 from John, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer of $9,000. You'll save $1,000 by going with John."
