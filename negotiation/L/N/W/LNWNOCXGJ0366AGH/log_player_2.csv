# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and $80 is your maximum price, buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
