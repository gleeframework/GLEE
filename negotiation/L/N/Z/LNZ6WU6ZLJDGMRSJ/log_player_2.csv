"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the value it holds while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still above my limit.  To find common ground, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, showing my genuine interest in this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect that. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $1,700,000 is still too high.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,450,000.  This shows my serious interest in purchasing your product, but I need to stay within my budget.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
