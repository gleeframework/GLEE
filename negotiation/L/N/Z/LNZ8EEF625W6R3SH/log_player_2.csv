"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still above his maximum budget of $80.  He should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start his counteroffer close to his maximum budget but still leaves room for negotiation. $85 is a reasonable starting point and may be appealing enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than his maximum of $80. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly, showing flexibility and commitment to reaching a deal. $90 is still a reasonable price for him while allowing for further negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the deal won't be reached within the 10 rounds. 

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $80. This guarantees him the item at his desired price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Alice."
