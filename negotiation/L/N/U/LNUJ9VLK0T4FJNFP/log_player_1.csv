Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price.** This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** This helps to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.

I'm aiming to find a price that is mutually agreeable while still getting as much money as possible. We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground, but I'm not going to settle for a deal that significantly undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my product is worth a lot more. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **The message is still friendly and focuses on the value of the product.**  This helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to consider my proposal.

I'm hopeful that this offer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still aiming to keep my costs down. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I've already made significant concessions and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. To maximize my earnings, I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 offer from John. I've already lost valuable time and energy with Bob, and it's time to secure a sale."
