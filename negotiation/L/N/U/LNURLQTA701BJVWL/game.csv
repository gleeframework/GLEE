,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I think the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $125 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to your offer, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than $115. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110, but I have to say that I'm getting a bit concerned about the price. I've been looking at other options, and I can get it from another seller for $80. I'd like to get a better price from you.",110.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'd like to add some value to the deal. I'll throw in a bonus service that's worth $10, so the total price would be $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus service, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra $10. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product, but I have to say that I'm still looking at other options, including buying it from another seller for $80. I'd like to get a better price from you.",105.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to add another bonus service that's worth $5, so the total price would be $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to pay more than $105. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",105.0,Bob,10,
