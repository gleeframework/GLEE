"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be of great benefit to you. I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a competitive price. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can still do better.  You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you can potentially get a lower price from Alice or explore other options."
