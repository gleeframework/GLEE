Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm confident that I can secure a good deal with Bob or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $19,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's slightly lower than my initial counteroffer, it's still a good deal and above my minimum value.  It's also likely that if I reject his offer, Bob will either counter with a lower price or walk away. This would leave me with the option of selling to John for a lower price."
