Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90, slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it also shows I'm confident in the product's worth.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would have preferred a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum threshold.  Accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to accept and avoids further negotiation.  Selling to John would result in the same price, so there's no benefit in that option."
