Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer and allows for potential compromise. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000, I can afford to be flexible with Bob. If negotiations stall or become unproductive, I have a guaranteed backup.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  By starting with a slightly higher price, I encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a better deal than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This indicates he's genuinely interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Seeking a Better Price:**  I want to try to maximize my earnings.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's Offer:**   Having John as a backup gives me confidence to hold out for a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still leaves some room for you to get a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By proposing a price in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that the price still offers Bob a good deal, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Balancing Needs:** This counteroffer balances my desire to get a higher price with the need to avoid losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, which would be $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** Bob's counteroffer of $10,750 is a significant move towards my price. This is likely the best deal I'll get from Bob.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  While $10,750 is lower than my ideal price, it's still much better than my minimum of $15,000. I can live with the slightly lower price knowing that John's offer is still a fallback option.
* **Avoid Risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a complete breakdown of the deal. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and eliminates the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
