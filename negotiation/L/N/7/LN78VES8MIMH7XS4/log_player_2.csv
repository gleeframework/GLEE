{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $12,000.  While we've been negotiating, it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that I'm comfortable with.  It's getting late in the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product altogether.  Therefore, I'll go ahead and purchase the product from John for $12,000."
