"Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently looking to invest within a budget of $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership,  $950,000 falls short of what I need to consider selling. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the highest amount I can reasonably offer within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and your willingness to come closer to my asking price. However, $1,050,000 still leaves me with a significant gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,075,000, recognizing the importance of finding a mutually beneficial solution. This is a final concession on my part, and I hope you'll see the value in securing this exceptional product at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet the price of $1,075,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is the highest amount I can realistically offer within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a fair agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
