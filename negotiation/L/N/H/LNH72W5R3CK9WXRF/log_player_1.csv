Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a bit of a gamble, as Bob may reject the offer, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but ultimately, I'll have the option to sell to John for the price I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $1,100,000. This is still lower than my ideal price, but it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying within a range that I find acceptable.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to continue negotiating, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to what I want, but still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to budge a little more.  It's a gamble, but if I can get a slightly better offer, it would be worth it.  If not, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,150,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and a little closer to Bob's, but still above his current offer. It shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but also that I'm not willing to go too low. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John, as we seem to be getting closer to the end of our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for a while now, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  Although $1,075,000 is a good price,  I'm not willing to compromise any further.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's a sure thing and the price I was aiming for from the start."
