"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price, closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $6,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility.  This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above our ideal price and what John is offering. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair price that considers the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

We're edging closer to John's price while still leaving some room for negotiation with Alice. This offer might be tempting enough for her to accept, considering she's already come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,000. I'll need to think about it, and I'll come back with a revised offer. Let me see what I can do. For now, I'll counter with $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we're still not there yet. There's no harm in seeing if we can get her down to $8,000, even if it means taking it down to the wire."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer.  I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering current market value."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

We're now matching John's offer. This puts the ball firmly in Alice's court. She can either accept our offer, which is still a good deal for her, or risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $8,250. That's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to budge further, and we're not gaining much by continuing to negotiate. We've reached a point where the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of Alice not budging and us losing out on John's offer."
