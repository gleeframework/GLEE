"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair price that considers the value of the product.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,000. I'll need to think about it, and I'll come back with a revised offer. Let me see what I can do. For now, I'll counter with $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $8,250. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,7,
