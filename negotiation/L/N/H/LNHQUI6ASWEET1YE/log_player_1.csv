{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is a strategic opening offer. It's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows room for negotiation.  Bob's willingness to pay $10,000 means there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal. By starting at $12,000, I create a space for Bob to counteroffer, while still maintaining a decent profit margin for myself.  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, I'm only comfortable paying $10,500. This is still a good deal for you as it's more than what I could get elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, it's significantly higher than what he was originally willing to pay, and I'm still open to negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I maintain my position and create an opportunity to counter-offer.  I want to try to secure a price closer to my desired value before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
