"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my absolute maximum, as I can purchase the same product from John for that price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
