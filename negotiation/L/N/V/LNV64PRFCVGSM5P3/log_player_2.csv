"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a very competitive price.  Let's discuss a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think about $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting price of $950,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This opens the door for potential negotiation where Alice might lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
