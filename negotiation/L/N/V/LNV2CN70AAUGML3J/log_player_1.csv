Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still making a significant profit, exceeding your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  There's room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to accept rather than immediately rejecting.
* **It shows confidence:**  You're not starting low and leaving a lot of room for negotiation, suggesting you believe in the product's worth. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is still a good profit, there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him, and gives you the chance to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but that's my final offer.  This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  You're not giving in completely.
* **It's closer to your ideal:**  You're getting closer to your target price.
* **It's clear and concise:**  You've stated it's your final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While a slight bit lower than your previous counteroffer,  $1,325,000 is still a very good price, and accepting it guarantees you a sale.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate would only lead to more back and forth, potentially ending in a sale to John at a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a strong profit."
