"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $30 higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject and see if you can get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay. This is a strong opening counteroffer, as it signals my serious intent to buy while also leaving room for potential negotiation. It's possible Alice might accept this price, especially considering she values the product at $120. If she rejects, we can continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $15 higher than my ideal price. I want to see if I can get closer to my $100 target. It's possible that Alice is willing to go lower, especially as we are getting closer to the end of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $100 to $105. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget. It's a reasonable compromise, and Alice might be willing to accept it, especially as we are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation."
