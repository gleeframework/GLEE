"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still above his maximum budget. This allows for some negotiation room, and hopefully pushes Alice towards a more acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's closer than before, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Bob can use his maximum budget as a firm line in the sand, and potentially even offer a slightly higher price to see if he can reach an agreement closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $1,300,000. This is still below Alice's current offer of $1,380,000, but shows that Bob is willing to negotiate. The goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties. This also keeps Bob's options open if Alice rejects, as he can still buy from John for $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is now within Bob's budget.  While it's not the ideal price, it's close enough to his maximum that it's worth accepting.  Further negotiation might get the price lower, but it could also risk losing the deal entirely.  Bob can save $50,000 by accepting the current offer, which is a reasonable compromise."
