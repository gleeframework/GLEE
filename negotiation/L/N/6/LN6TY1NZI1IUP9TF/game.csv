,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm trying to be responsible with my finances.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $22,000 represents the product's true worth, I'm willing to come down to $20,000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $20,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I value your interest and want to see this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end and represents a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me.",15000.0,Bob,6,
