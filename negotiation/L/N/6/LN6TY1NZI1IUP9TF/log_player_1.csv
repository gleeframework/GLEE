Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm trying to be responsible with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $22,000 represents the product's true worth, I'm willing to come down to $20,000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $20,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

We are still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and moving closer to our desired price point.  We'll reject and counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I value your interest and want to see this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end and represents a great deal for you."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has now met John's offer. It's unlikely we can get a better deal from Bob at this point, and continuing the negotiation has a higher risk with no guaranteed reward.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
