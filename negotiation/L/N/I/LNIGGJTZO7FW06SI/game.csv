"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,600,000 is far above my budget. Given the product's value to you at $1,200,000, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's worth to me and provides you with a significant profit.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,450,000? This accounts for the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which recognizes the product's value to you while staying within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
