"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $850000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to make sure the price reflects that for me. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
