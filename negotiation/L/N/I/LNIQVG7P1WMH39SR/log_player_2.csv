Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point. While I'd prefer to pay closer to $700,000, accepting her offer at $775,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I'm getting a good deal."
