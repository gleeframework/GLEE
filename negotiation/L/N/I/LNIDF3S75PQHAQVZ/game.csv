"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $11000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",11250.0,Alice,5,
