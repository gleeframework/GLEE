Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a price of $10,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his willingness to pay. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything, as you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but remember your minimum acceptable price is $8,000."
