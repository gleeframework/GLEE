{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $525,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Given that I can still save a significant amount compared to John's offer, it makes sense to accept this deal to secure the product and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
