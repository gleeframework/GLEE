Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above your minimum, but leaves room for Bob to bargain. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is above your minimum, you can still potentially get closer to Bob's valuation of $150. Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $130 is a good price, I'd prefer to stick with $135.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's still above your minimum and closer to Bob's offer.  This helps keep the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to your initial counteroffer of $135, and only $3 below the maximum you think you can get from him.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and maximizes your profit given the current negotiation."
