"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a fair market value. How about we start at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is my final offer.  It's a significant discount from my original price and a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $800,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $800,000 just doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $850,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
