"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within Bob's budget.  It also frames the offer as fair to both parties, which could encourage Alice to consider it seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob has a safety net with John's offer, so he can afford to be more patient and try to push for a lower price.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the most strategic option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still only comfortable at $1,300,000. I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to negotiate but still aims for a lower price.  By offering $1,300,000, he's closer to Alice's price but still below his maximum budget. The message acknowledges Alice's compromise while emphasizing that finding a mutually agreeable price is a priority."
