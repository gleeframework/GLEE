"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to think about it for a moment. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm not sure $1,025,000 is quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. My counteroffer is $1,075,000 is too low, so I will try to be more aggressive and offer $1,100,000 is also too low, so I will go to $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
