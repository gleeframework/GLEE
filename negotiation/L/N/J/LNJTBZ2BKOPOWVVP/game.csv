"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I've made a significant concession by offering the product at $14250, and now you're asking me to meet you at $13000? I'm not comfortable with that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $13750. This is my final offer, Bob. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
