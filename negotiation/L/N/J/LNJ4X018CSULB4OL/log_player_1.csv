Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal.""
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product is worth a significant amount, you're subtly anchoring Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you introduce a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker. 

While there's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer, it sets the stage for further negotiation. If he rejects, Alice can always counter with a lower price, closer to $120-$130, before ultimately going down to John's offer of $100."
