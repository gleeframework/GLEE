"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle for $1,200,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This leaves a fair margin for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget. Would you consider $1,230,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1230000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,230,000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,270,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1270000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  How about we settle this right now at $1,250,000? It's a strong offer, and it saves us both from more back and forth.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
