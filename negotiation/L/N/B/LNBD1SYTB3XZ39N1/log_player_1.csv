Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My minimum:**  I need at least $1,000,000.
* **John's offer:**  John is willing to pay $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation:** I want to maximize my profit, but also ensure Bob accepts the offer.  Offering $1,400,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still allowing me to earn a good amount.  

By offering $1,400,000, I'm taking a calculated risk. Bob might reject the offer, but I'm confident the offer is attractive enough to motivate him to accept."
