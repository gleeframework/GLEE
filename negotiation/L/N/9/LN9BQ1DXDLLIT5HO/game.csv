"I really like the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, is that something you'd be willing to accept?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $105? That's a compromise I'm willing to make.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we say $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
