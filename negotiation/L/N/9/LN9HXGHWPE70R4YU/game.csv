"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this time.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",850000.0,Alice,5,
