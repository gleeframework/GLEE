Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

While I could potentially get the product for $800,000 from John, accepting Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal. It saves me $250,000 from her initial offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially falling apart."
