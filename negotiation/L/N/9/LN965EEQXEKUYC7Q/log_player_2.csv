Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $815,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is likely very close to her absolute bottom line. Accepting the $815,000 offer secures a significant discount from both John's price and your perceived value. Continuing to negotiate might only yield a marginal improvement, and there's a risk of Alice hardening her stance."
