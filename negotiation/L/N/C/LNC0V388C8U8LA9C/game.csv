,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $105?  I'm really hoping to get a deal on this.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer for it quickly.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $112. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at $112, I'm willing to sell it to you.",112.0,Alice,5,
