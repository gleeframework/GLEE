Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  My best price is $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your guaranteed price leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob.  
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if you could potentially get a bit more money, but this depends on your priorities. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation or how much he values the product beyond $8,000.  If you had more information, you might adjust your strategy."
