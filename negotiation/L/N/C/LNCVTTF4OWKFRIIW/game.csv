"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $105 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $102. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
