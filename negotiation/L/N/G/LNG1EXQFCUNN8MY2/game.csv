"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in making a deal. However, I'm going to need to see a lower price to make this work.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given the value we both see in it. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in buying the product, and I appreciate you coming down in your price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the best we can do. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm now offering it to you for $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
