**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still $300,000 higher than your ideal price.  There's room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better deal before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the value it holds for you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still a $150,000 difference.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and save more money before settling.  John is always an option if this deal falls through, but for now, the potential savings are worth the effort."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the best we can do. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm now offering it to you for $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, coming down to $1,120,000.  This is only $20,000 away from your last counteroffer, and it's well within your budget. It's likely that any further negotiation will only be a few thousand dollars.  It's time to accept the deal and move forward."
