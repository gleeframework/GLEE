"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but it's still possible to get a better deal. There's no reason to rush into an agreement in the first round.  By rejecting, Bob can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $750,000 is a strong starting point for negotiation. It's a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of possibility if Alice is truly motivated to sell. This counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, allowing Bob to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price point, potentially pushing Alice further. It also gives Bob more information about Alice's bottom line and how determined she is to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increasing his offer from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer. This should encourage Alice to consider a deal, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
