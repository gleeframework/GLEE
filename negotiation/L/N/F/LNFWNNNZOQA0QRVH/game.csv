"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. My initial offer is $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, your initial price is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  However, $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to stick with my original offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick with your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a minimum of $1,100,000 to be comfortable with the sale. My next offer is $920,000.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $920,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and leaves some room for profit on your end.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is a compromise between our last offers. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",900000.0,Alice,7,
