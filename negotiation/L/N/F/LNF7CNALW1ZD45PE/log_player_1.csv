{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but below your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. It also sets a positive tone for the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to sell now, rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and has the potential to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. However, I still believe we can reach a better agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  It's worth trying to get a slightly higher price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
