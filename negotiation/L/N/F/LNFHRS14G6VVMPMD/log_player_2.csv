Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle - would $10,500 work for you?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $10,500 is still a little too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,500?  That's a fair offer, reflecting both the value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I appreciate your perspective on the value, but $7,500 is still too low for me to consider. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'd rather make this deal work with you. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is trying to create urgency, $9,500 is still above your maximum budget and what you can get the product for from John. You've already made a reasonable attempt to negotiate with Alice."
