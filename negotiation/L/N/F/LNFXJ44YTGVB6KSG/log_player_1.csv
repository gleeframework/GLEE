Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for this product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal.  $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can push him a little further.  I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
