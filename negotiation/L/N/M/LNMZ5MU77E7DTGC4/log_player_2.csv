# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
