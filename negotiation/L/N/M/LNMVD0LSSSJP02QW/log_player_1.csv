Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and hopefully shows him the value I place on the product. If he rejects, I'll be ready to adjust based on his counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to settle for it right away. Bob's offer is very low, and I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll see what I can get by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair middle ground and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is close to my minimum and a reasonable compromise.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and it's risky to keep negotiating, especially with John waiting in the wings. It's time to take the deal and secure a good profit."
