"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go quite that low. I can do $11,000 for the product, which is still a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
