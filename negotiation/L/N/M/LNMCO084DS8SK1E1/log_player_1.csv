""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $200. I think you'll find it's a steal at this rate."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. Accepting now guarantees the sale and prevents the risk of losing him as a buyer."
