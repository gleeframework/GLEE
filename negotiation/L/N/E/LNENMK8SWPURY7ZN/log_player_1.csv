Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below what John is offering. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and get a quick sale, I'm aiming for a better price. I'll reject and counteroffer, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still leaving a decent profit margin.  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also keeping the price above Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer.  Accepting this offer is a reasonable compromise, as I'm unsure if I'll get a higher offer from Bob in future rounds.  This deal guarantees a sale and gets me closer to my desired outcome."
