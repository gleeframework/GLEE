"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is only $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you're getting from the sale.",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
