"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget, and it's much better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is only $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, hoping to get closer to his $8,000 limit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you're getting from the sale."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still not within his limit of $8,000. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000, as he's already spent some time negotiating with Alice and it's unclear if he'll be able to get her lower."
