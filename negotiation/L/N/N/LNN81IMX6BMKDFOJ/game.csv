"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $175 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $137.50 is still too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my absolute maximum is $110. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we compromise at $125? It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",125.0,Alice,5,
