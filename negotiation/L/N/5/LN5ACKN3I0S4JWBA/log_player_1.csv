Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that your asking price is justified. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, there's no need to reveal this to Bob. It weakens your negotiating position.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is open to discussion, suggesting you might be willing to negotiate if Bob counters. 

By offering the product at $20,000, Alice aims to maximize her potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider, given that the product holds equal value to him."
