Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be upfront.  $1,200,000 simply isn't feasible for me given the value this product represents.  My final offer is $1,500,000. This is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.
