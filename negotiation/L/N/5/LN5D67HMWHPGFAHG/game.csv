"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product.  I believe this item has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you, and I wouldn't want to undervalue it.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the extensive work behind it. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $1,875,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding common ground while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,875,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be upfront.  $1,200,000 simply isn't feasible for me given the value this product represents.  My final offer is $1,500,000. This is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you being upfront. While $1,500,000 is still a bit outside my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's try to make this happen.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
