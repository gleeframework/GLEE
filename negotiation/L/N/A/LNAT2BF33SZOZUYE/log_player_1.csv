Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is well above your floor of $800,000, meaning you'll still make a substantial profit even if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's still a $300,000 potential gap for him to bargain with. 
* **It incentivizes Bob to accept:**  The price is attractive enough that he might be more likely to accept rather than risk losing the product entirely and potentially having to find an alternative solution. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
