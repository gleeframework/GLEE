Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at the highest price possible, knowing that I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay my minimum. This gives me the best negotiating position.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:** I provide a brief justification for the price (its value to me). 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I conclude by asking for Bob's thoughts, signaling that I'm open to negotiation but starting strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I believe it's a good compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.**  While $800,000 is still a good amount of money, it's below my minimum acceptable price.
* **I have a backup buyer (John).** This gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price.
* **Counter-offering is a better strategy.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer closer to my desired price, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable middle ground.  

I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my asking price before selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a compromise on my end.  This price still allows me to achieve my goals with the sale. Let's see if we can find common ground at this point."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my minimum price.
* **Compromise:** I'm positioning my counter-offer as a compromise to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. 
* **Justification:** I'm giving Bob a reason for the price (meeting my goals).
* **Call to Action:** I end with a call to action, urging Bob to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my target price. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I think this is a fair middle ground considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John is a Secure Option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my full asking price. This provides security and eliminates any risk of losing out on a significant amount of money.
* **Further Negotiation Might Not Be Worth It:** While a counter-offer could potentially increase Bob's price, the potential gain is limited compared to the certainty of selling to John. It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer in the next round.

Considering the potential for a lengthy negotiation and the secure alternative, I believe it's more advantageous to sell the product to John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your target price.  However, $850,000 is still a significant distance from what I need to make this sale work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer the product for $925,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you'll receive.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counter-Offer:** I'm making a final counter-offer to give Bob one last chance to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm presenting my counter-offer as a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to move towards his price.  I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer of $900,000 and his offer of $850,000.
* **Highlighting Concession:** I emphasize that this offer is a ""significant concession"" to increase the pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Ultimatum:** I'm setting a clear ultimatum by stating that if this offer isn't acceptable, I'll have to move forward with another buyer. This creates urgency and incentivizes Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Potential Gain:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is only a $25,000 increase from his previous offer.  
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and waste valuable time.
* **John Offers Certainty:** Selling to John guarantees me my full asking price of $1,000,000, providing a secure and risk-free outcome.

Given the limited potential for further negotiation and the guaranteed profit with John, I'm choosing to sell the product to John."
