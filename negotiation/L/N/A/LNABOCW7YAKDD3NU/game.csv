"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Let's split the difference - $1300000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
