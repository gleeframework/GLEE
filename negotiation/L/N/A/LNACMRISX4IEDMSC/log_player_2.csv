"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its unique value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While that price doesn't fully reflect the product's value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $1,550,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,550,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Even though it's closer, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. It's still possible Alice might be willing to drop further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider coming down to $1,350,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can afford at this time."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting close.  Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,450,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It's unlikely she'll go lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,200,000, which is within his budget. It's the best decision to accept John's offer and avoid further risk."
