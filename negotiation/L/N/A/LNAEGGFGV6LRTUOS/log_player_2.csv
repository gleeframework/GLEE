"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if I can save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her original price. While $1,150,000 is still more than I'd like to pay, it's a good compromise and a substantial savings compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product and avoid further negotiations that could potentially lead to a higher price or a breakdown in the deal."
