"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
