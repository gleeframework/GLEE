"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is a great deal for both of us - you'll get a valuable product for a price below its true worth, and I'll get a good price for something I value highly.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
