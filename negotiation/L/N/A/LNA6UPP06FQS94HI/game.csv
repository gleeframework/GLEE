"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1150000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1200000, so I'll offer you a price of $1175000. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1125000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
