"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or see if she makes a better offer. If Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
