Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's value, but there are only 3 rounds left. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers as there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. Buying from John at $15,000 is a safe and guaranteed option, while trying to negotiate further risks losing out completely."
