"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""unique potential"" and ""true worth,""  we aim to anchor Bob's perception of value closer to our asking price.
* **Openness:** Expressing willingness to discuss further softens the stance and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair reflection of its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While selling to John is an option, I still have room to negotiate with Bob. I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to reach a deal."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer to show I'm engaged but stand firm that it's too low.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating ""unique aspects"" reinforces the product's worth beyond Bob's current valuation.
* **Significant Concession:**  A $200,000 drop is substantial and may encourage Bob to reciprocate, even if it's not his final offer.
* **Urgency (Implied):** Mentioning my desire to reach a deal subtly introduces a sense of time sensitivity, although I haven't threatened to walk away just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which reflects a compromise and shows my genuine interest in this product. Let's work together to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not there yet. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a potential $100,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and capture some of that value.  There's still risk involved, but I'm aiming to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm proposing $1,650,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appreciation:** Continuing to acknowledge Bob's efforts to find common ground helps maintain a positive tone.
* **Compromise:** A $150,000 reduction from my previous offer is still significant and shows I'm flexible.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and signal that I'm unwilling to go lower.  Bob now needs to decide if the product is worth this price to him.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""fair compromise"" aims to frame the offer as balanced and reasonable. 

**Important:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm committing to accepting his counteroffer only if it meets or exceeds $1,650,000. If he counters below this, I'll need to consider selling to John to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I stated $1,650,000 was my ""final offer,"" Bob's counter of $1,500,000 matches what John is willing to pay.  There's no point in further negotiation:

* **No Upside:**  I won't get more from Bob, and John's offer eliminates the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays with further rounds or finding a new buyer if Bob rejects future offers. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I achieve my minimum acceptable price and avoid the risk of losing out on the sale."
