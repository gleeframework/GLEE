"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great:**  $950,000 is a significant discount, but Bob can likely do better.
* **Negotiation is possible:** The fact that Alice is willing to negotiate at all suggests there's room for further price reduction.
* **John's offer is a backup:** If negotiations with Alice fall apart, Bob has a guaranteed option at $1,000,000.

**Strategy:** Bob should reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $50,000 reduction is a substantial offer that shows Bob is serious about buying.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This counteroffer still allows for further negotiation if Alice is willing to meet in the middle.
* **Avoids immediate fallback:**  If Alice rejects, Bob still has time to counter again before needing to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise reached:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $925,000 is a good deal for Bob.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice becoming unwilling to sell or losing the deal entirely.
* **Minimizing loss:** While $925,000 isn't the lowest possible price, it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John.

**Strategy:** Bob should accept Alice's offer to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the potential risks of further negotiation."
