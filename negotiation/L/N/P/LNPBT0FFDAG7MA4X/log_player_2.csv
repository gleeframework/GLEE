"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a unique opportunity to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $90 is still too high, and you can likely get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $87.50. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still very close to your ideal price of $85. Since you have 7 more rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $87.50 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a number that works for both of us. How about $86? I'm really interested in this product and want to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $86.50. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $86.50, which is just slightly above your ideal price of $85.  You've already gone through 5 rounds, and while you could try to squeeze out an extra 50 cents, it's likely not worth the risk of Alice getting annoyed and walking away.  Accepting the offer is the best option."
