"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $108.  This is my final offer.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112, but I can't go any lower.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. What do you say?",112.0,Alice,5,
