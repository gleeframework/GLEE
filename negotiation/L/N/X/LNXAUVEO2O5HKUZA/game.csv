"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company.  It's worth at least $1 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $950,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
