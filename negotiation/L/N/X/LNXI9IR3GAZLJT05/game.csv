"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while ensuring you get a product that is worth every penny. Consider this a one-time opportunity. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
