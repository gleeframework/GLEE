"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while ensuring you get a product that is worth every penny. Consider this a one-time opportunity. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $1,050,000.  Since you can get it from John for your maximum price, it's better to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
