"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm asking for $20000 for it. Would you be interested in learning more? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. It's always a good strategy to start by rejecting the initial offer and seeing if you can negotiate a better price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to work towards a mutually acceptable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely an intriguing product. However, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a bold move, immediately stating your maximum price. It also tries to show interest in the product to make Alice more willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, I need to recoup at least some of the value I've invested in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You have several rounds remaining, so rejecting and countering again gives you more leverage to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm happy to go up to $16,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away satisfied with this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate further, but you're staying firm about your budget limitations.  You're trying to find a sweet spot where you're not overpaying, but you're also not pushing Alice too far away."
