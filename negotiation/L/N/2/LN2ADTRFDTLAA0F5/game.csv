"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely an intriguing product. However, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, I need to recoup at least some of the value I've invested in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm happy to go up to $16000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away satisfied with this deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
