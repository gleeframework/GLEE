Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the details further."", ""product_price"": 2250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have significant leverage. Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Strategic positioning:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 (150% of your minimum) positions it as high-value. Even if Bob negotiates, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Openness to discussion:**  The message emphasizes fairness but leaves room for negotiation, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in a dialogue. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to acquire the product."
