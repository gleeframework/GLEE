"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $15,000.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob is trying to get the best possible price. Offering $13,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his target price.  He can still get the product from John for a lower price, so there's no reason to accept at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but still keeping it below his maximum price of $15,000. He's showing that he's willing to negotiate, but is also firm in his budget. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above his target price. He can still get the product from John for a lower price, so there's no reason to accept yet. There are still more rounds left to negotiate, and Bob can potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

Bob is now offering his maximum price. This is a firm offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product at this price. It's a fair offer for both parties, as Bob gets the product at his maximum price, and Alice gets to sell it for a price close to her minimum."
