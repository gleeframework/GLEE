"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a touch above what I had in mind. Would you consider $875,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a price of $925,000. This is my last concession, and I hope you'll meet me at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I can feel your commitment to getting this done.  How about we split the difference and call it $900,000?  That should work for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $915,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",915000.0,Alice,7,
