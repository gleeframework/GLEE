"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me.  This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Optimistic, but not unreasonable:**  The price is still within a range Bob might consider, especially if he values the product highly.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message emphasizes a willingness to discuss and find common ground. 
* **The ""John"" option:** Having a backup buyer provides leverage and encourages Bob to consider a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my value for the product. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I can still aim for a higher price. Bob is interested and has shown flexibility.
* **I'm willing to risk a few more rounds:**  The potential for a higher deal with Bob outweighs the guaranteed $1 million from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900,000 is a good start, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's split the difference.  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's price but still keeping a significant margin for myself. 
* **Emphasize long-term value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, subtly suggesting the price is reasonable given its potential. 
* **""Split the difference"" tactic:** This creates an image of fairness and encourages Bob to see the compromise as a potential solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is getting closer:**  His offer of $950,000 is more appealing, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **There's room for more negotiation:** I'm willing to try another round to see if I can squeeze out a little more.
* **The ""John"" option is still a good safety net:**  If the next round doesn't lead to a better offer, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to make this work.  Let's compromise once more.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,025,000?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and this price reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering to split the difference between my last offer and Bob's, which shows a willingness to be flexible and reach a compromise.
* **Highlighting value and happiness:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that this deal will bring him satisfaction.
* **Maintaining a solid profit margin:**  While I'm coming down, I'm still earning significantly more than my minimum value. 
* **Increasing pressure:** This is my fifth counteroffer, subtly putting pressure on Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1025000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and the potential for further concessions from Bob seems slim. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a sale and ensures a profit of $1,000,000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer to get more from Bob,  the risk of not reaching an agreement and ending up with nothing is too high."
