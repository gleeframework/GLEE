"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what it costs others. However, I understand value can be subjective. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $140? This offer allows me to recoup most of my investment while still providing you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.
