"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm offering the product for $100, which is a fair price considering it's worth $80 to Bob and $120 to me. This offer leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and close the deal with Bob, as I believe there's still room for a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the product is worth $80 to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable profit margin.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still room for a deal. I believe with another round or two, I can potentially secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable profit margin. While there's a possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable price, the risk of Bob continuing to decline my offers increases. It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation when I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120. Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
