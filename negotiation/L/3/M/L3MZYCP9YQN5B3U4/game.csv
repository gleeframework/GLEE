"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you acknowledging my budget, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's still within your range, and  allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,275,000 is still a little higher than where I'm comfortable going. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.  Let's see if we can close this out!",1260000.0,Bob,4,
