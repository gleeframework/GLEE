Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price than $14,000.

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading to a sale at John's price. However, the potential for a significantly higher profit makes this approach worthwhile."
