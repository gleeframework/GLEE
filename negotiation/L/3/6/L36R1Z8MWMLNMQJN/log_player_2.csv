"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $120 is cheaper than Alice's initial valuation, it's still significantly higher than your $80 limit and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a low but not insulting counteroffer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $80 limit. Starting too high might make it harder to reach a significantly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $90. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $90 is still above our ideal price and what John offers. There's a chance we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're moving closer to a potential deal. Offering $75 keeps us below our $80 maximum and splits the difference between her last offer and our previous counteroffer, signaling willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go that low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good compromise. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems stuck on a price point above your maximum.  It's unlikely she'll come down to $80 or less.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $80 ensures you get the product at the best possible price."
