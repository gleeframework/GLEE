Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Bottom Line:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's the absolute lowest you'll accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum.  Any deal depends on negotiation.

**Strategy**

Since Bob's perceived value is lower than your minimum, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor, Aim for Compromise:**  Start with a price significantly higher than $1,500,000. This might make Bob see your final ""compromise"" (still above your minimum) as a win.  This is risky if Bob walks away easily.
2. **Direct Sale to John:** Given the limited ZOPA, selling to John guarantees your desired profit and avoids negotiation.

**Offer (Option 1 - Attempting Negotiation)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,850,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussion, and I'm open to exploring options that benefit both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** This sets a high anchor, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Willingness to Negotiate:**  The language suggests you're flexible, but it doesn't commit you to a specific price drop.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator who walks away easily, this approach is risky.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** Are you willing to risk losing the sale to Bob to try for a higher price?

**Option 2 (Direct Sale to John) is the safest if you want to secure your $1,500,000 immediately.**"
