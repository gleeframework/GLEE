"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1300000. How about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1250000 is still significantly below what I need to achieve.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1350000? This reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to come away satisfied. Let's reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
