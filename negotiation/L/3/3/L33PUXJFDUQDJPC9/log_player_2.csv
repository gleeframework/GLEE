"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested, I'm open to discussing further details.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice or proceeding with your guaranteed purchase from John."
