"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $600,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",650000.0,Alice,5,
