"I understand where you're coming from, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet at $110? It's a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, which would be $100. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,4,,
