# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal for both of us!  I know you value it highly, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and John is offering the product for less. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
