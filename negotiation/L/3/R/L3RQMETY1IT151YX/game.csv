"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $12,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the product considering its value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
