Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think I can squeeze a bit more out of this deal. I'll do $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a one-time offer, though, so you'll need to decide quickly.

Alice is unwilling to budge from $11,250.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and accepting means overpaying. Buying from John at $15,000, while not ideal, ensures Bob gets the product without exceeding his absolute limit.  It's a loss compared to an ideal deal with Alice, but safer than endless back-and-forth."
