"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $10,000 is a bit below my target. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to go down to $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $11,250? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $11,000 is my limit.  Take it or leave it.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think I can squeeze a bit more out of this deal. I'll do $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a one-time offer, though, so you'll need to decide quickly.",11250.0,Alice,7,
