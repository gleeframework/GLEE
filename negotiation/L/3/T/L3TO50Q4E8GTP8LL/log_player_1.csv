Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to a fair deal, it's still below what I can accept.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $975,000 is a significant profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in future rounds."
