"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to accept your price of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",990000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to save as much as possible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I've already met you halfway in the previous offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1020000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
