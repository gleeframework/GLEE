Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also uses friendly language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  I'm confident Bob will want to negotiate, but I'm also ready to walk away if he doesn't meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is higher than my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $14,000 with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750. I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $12,750 is still a bit lower than my target, it's a fair compromise and closer to my minimum.  Given that Bob is now closer to my target price, I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation."
