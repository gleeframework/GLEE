"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low and doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that makes this a win-win. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $1,037,500?",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll offer $1,012,500, which is closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.",1012500.0,Bob,6,
