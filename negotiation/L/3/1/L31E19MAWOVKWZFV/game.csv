"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $7,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
