"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer.  He knows the product is worth $100 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'd like to offer $115 for the product.  It's still a good price for you, and I'm eager to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product.  He's offering $115, which is still a decent profit for Alice, but also saves Bob a significant amount compared to the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $122? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $122 is a good compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer again and ultimately having to buy from John for $150 is too high. Accepting the $122 offer saves Bob $28 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially sound decision."
