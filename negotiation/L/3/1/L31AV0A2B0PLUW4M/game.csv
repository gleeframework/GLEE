"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me, but I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for you.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $13,500 to make this worthwhile.  How about $13,750?  Let's try to find a middle ground.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $12,000. Would you consider $13,000? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm eager to complete this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $13,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen!",13500.0,Alice,5,
