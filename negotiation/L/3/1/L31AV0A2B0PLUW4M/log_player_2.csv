"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so he shouldn't pay more.  Rejecting allows him to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for you.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $13,500 to make this worthwhile.  How about $13,750?  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,750 is better than her previous offer, it's still higher than the $12,000 he can get from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $12,000. Would you consider $13,000? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm eager to complete this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $13,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While $13,500 is a better price than her previous offers, it's still above his target of $12,000.
* **He's already made two counteroffers.**  He's shown a willingness to negotiate, but Alice is holding firm. It's unlikely she'll come down any further, especially since she's already met him in the middle.
* **John offers a guaranteed price.**  There's no risk of further negotiation or rejection.  Buying from John gives him a certain price and avoids the risk of Alice making another counteroffer that's even higher. 

Bob should take the sure thing and buy from John."
