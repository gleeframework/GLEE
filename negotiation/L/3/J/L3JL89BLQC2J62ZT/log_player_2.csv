Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm open to selling the product for $1,200,000. This allows you a substantial profit margin, and it's still a fair price for the unique value this product offers.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you some profit.  Let's aim for a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer. While $900,000 is closer to my expectations, I still need to ensure a reasonable return on this valuable product. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but $1,050,000 is still over your limit. You can likely squeeze out a better deal with a counteroffer. It's a good idea to keep negotiating as you're still within your rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and your willingness to increase your offer.  $950,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to offer a final compromise -  $1,000,000. This is a price that reflects the unique value of the product while still allowing you a significant profit. Let's make this deal happen, Bob.  It's time for us to come together and find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $1,000,000 is still over your budget.  You've already negotiated for six rounds, and you only have four left.  It's time to consider your other option: buying from John for $800,000. This will save you $200,000 compared to Alice's final offer.  It's a good idea to secure the product at the price you're comfortable with rather than risking a further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
