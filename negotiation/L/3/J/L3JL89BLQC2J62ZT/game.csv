"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm open to selling the product for $1,200,000. This allows you a substantial profit margin, and it's still a fair price for the unique value this product offers.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you some profit.  Let's aim for a win-win situation.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer. While $900,000 is closer to my expectations, I still need to ensure a reasonable return on this valuable product. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and your willingness to increase your offer.  $950,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to offer a final compromise -  $1,000,000. This is a price that reflects the unique value of the product while still allowing you a significant profit. Let's make this deal happen, Bob.  It's time for us to come together and find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
