"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. I think that's a fair offer considering its potential.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,450,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate the compromise you've offered. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $1,625,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,625,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $1,500,000 even?  It's my final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
