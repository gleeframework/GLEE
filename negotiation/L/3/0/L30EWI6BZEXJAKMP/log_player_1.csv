Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a fair starting point, given the product's value to both of us. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}

I'm going to counter with $170. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price above my minimum."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $165. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
