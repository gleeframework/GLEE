Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has tremendous potential and I'm confident you'll be impressed by its features. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?
