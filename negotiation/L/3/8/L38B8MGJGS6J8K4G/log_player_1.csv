This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is less than Bob's maximum value but leaves room for potential negotiation.  It also opens the door for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $7,000 is better than selling to John, it's significantly below my minimum desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my value."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $7,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
