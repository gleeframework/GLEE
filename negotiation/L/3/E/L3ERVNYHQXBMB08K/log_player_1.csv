Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $1,400,000, a price that reflects its true worth. "", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, my goal is to get the highest price possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it above this price leaves room for negotiation but keeps the offer within a potentially acceptable range for him.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves me space to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob counters, while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a potentially lucrative sale to Bob and the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
