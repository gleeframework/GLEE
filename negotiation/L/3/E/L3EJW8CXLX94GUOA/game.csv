"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $1,200,000. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is lower than my initial ask, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm open to finding a compromise.  $1,400,000 is closer to what I need, but I'd need to come down a bit further.  I'm willing to sell at $1,500,000 to make this work.  This price allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's make this happen.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
