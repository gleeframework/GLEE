"I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $65. How about we try $77.50?",77.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $70, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we try $75? That's the best I can do at this point.",75.0,Alice,5,
