"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. $10,000 is quite low for what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a bigger commitment from your side too.  How about $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This is a good compromise, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,6,
