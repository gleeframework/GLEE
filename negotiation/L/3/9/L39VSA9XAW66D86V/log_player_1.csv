Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This is a good compromise, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $13,000 offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
