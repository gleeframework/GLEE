"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if needed. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for such a significant loss.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's a slight improvement. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still confident it's a fair price given the product's value to me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to consider selling to John at $1,500,000, but I'll still try to negotiate with Bob one more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. With only four rounds left, I'm taking the safe option and selling to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get a fair price and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that could lead to an even lower price."
