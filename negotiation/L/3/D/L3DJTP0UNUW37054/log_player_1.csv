Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and it would leave some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to me than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,025,000 is still a bit above what I can justify right now.  I'm happy to go to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, as it aligns with my budget and gives you a significant return on your investment.
