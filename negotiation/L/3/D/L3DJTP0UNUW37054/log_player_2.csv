"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your target price. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and try to bring the price down closer to your desired $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to me than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit higher than what I want to pay.  I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get the price down even more.  By rejecting this offer, I can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my target of $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,025,000 is still a bit above what I can justify right now.  I'm happy to go to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, as it aligns with my budget and gives you a significant return on your investment. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,015,000. This is a slight compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I place on the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is only $15,000 lower than what I'm willing to pay from John. It's a small difference, and while I could keep negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my offer again is high. At this point, it's not worth the potential hassle. I'm confident that John will sell me the product at my maximum price, so I'll take the guaranteed deal and save myself further negotiation."
