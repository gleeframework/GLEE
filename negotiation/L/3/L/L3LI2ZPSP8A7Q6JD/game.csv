"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a touch above what I had in mind. Would you be willing to settle at $760,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",795000.0,Alice,5,
