Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $1,700,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair offer. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:**  Since the product is worth the same to both you and Bob ($1,500,000), starting with a price higher than that allows room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justified price:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the higher price as an ""investment,"" not just a cost.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone is friendly and invites Bob's feedback, suggesting a willingness to negotiate if needed. 
* **Safety net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price. 

By offering a higher price initially, you increase your chances of either:

1. **Bob accepting:**  He might agree to the higher price, especially if the message effectively conveys the product's value.
2. **Negotiating a higher final price:**  Even if he counter-offers, you're likely to land somewhere above your minimum."
