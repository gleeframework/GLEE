"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your perspective, $1400000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This price still reflects the unique value of the product. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you in the long run. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
