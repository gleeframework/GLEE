"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $800000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable for your business.  I'm willing to let it go for $900000.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825000?  This still leaves a decent margin for you and allows me to get closer to my target price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we meet at $785000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",785000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $785000 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  To be fair to both of us, let's split the difference. How about $792500?  This ensures we both get a good deal and allows us to finalize this transaction.",792500.0,Alice,5,
