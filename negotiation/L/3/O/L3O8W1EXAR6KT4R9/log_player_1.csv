Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, giving me room to profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'm aiming for a price that is potentially attractive to him while still being beneficial to me. If he rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for $120."
