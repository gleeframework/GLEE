"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
