Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **It sets a strong initial position:**  You're showing confidence in the value of your product. 

Keep in mind, this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the consideration. However, I am only willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below your desired minimum of $800,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. You can use this opportunity to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer, indicating flexibility.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reinforcing the justification for the price. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  ""Significant compromise"" signals a genuine attempt to reach an agreement.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive while maintaining a price that is closer to your desired minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the reduction. However, I am still unable to meet you at $900,000. I am willing to pay up to $875,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is only $75,000 below your minimum acceptable price.  While you might prefer to push for a higher price,  it's important to consider the potential risks:

* **Further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Lost opportunity cost:**  Holding out for a higher price could result in lost time and the possibility that Bob will back out of the deal entirely. 
* **John's offer:**  While John is willing to pay $800,000, it's unlikely he'll offer a higher price.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is relatively close to your minimum and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation or a lower final price."
