"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to the product's true value, Bob can still try to get a better price. He has a fallback option with John, so there's no immediate need to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. I'm confident this product is worth that to me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900000 to make this work. Let's split the difference and go with $875000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good price for Bob. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and going back to her original price, or even a higher price, is not worth it.  He can save $25,000 compared to buying from John."
