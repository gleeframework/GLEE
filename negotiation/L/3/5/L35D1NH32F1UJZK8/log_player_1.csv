Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $120, so $135 is within his potential willingness to pay.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $150, so $135 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell.

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'd be happy to pay $125.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is more than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum. It's worth trying to push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $130. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm still aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible, but $130 is still above Bob's offer. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $130.  How about we meet in the middle at $127?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $127 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid any further negotiation."
