Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,000,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob hasn't moved much from his initial offer, and we're running out of rounds. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that certainty."
