"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be fair.  However, $85 just doesn't work for me. How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price.  Let me know your thoughts.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $95 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. Can we agree on that price?",90.0,Bob,6,
