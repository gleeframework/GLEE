We're getting closer, but I still think there's room for Bob to move a bit.  We'll aim for a price between $875,000 and $900,000 in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

While we could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $880,000 is a strong strategic move at this point:

* **Significant Profit:** $880,000 is well above our minimum acceptable price and represents a healthy profit margin.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Prolonged negotiations can lead to frustration and potentially cause the deal to fall through entirely. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now gives us access to the funds sooner, which has its own inherent value.

It's a reasonable compromise that secures a favorable outcome for both parties."
