"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
