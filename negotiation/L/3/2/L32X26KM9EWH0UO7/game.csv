"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,200,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more affordable.  Could we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. That's my minimum price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on that. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, but that's as low as I can go.",790000.0,Alice,5,
