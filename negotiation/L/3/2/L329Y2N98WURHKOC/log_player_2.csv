{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than I'd like to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $110?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from meeting my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $125. It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to my goal, $125 is still a bit more than I want to spend. I'll try negotiating a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $117?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $123. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $123
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $120.  At this point, the $7 difference is probably not worth the risk of her walking away or further rounds of negotiation."
