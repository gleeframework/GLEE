"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $13,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500? This would still allow you to make a good profit while ensuring I get a fair price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the flexibility shown. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,000 for the product. This aligns closer to my budgetary considerations while still reflecting the value I see in the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",13000.0,Bob,4,
