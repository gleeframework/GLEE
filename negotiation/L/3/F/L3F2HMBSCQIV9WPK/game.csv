"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10000?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $11250. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
