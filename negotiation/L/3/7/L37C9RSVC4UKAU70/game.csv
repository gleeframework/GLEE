"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I've done my research and I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. However, to be honest, $850,000 is still a stretch for my budget. How about $725,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while making this a worthwhile deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $725,000 is a fair price for this product. I've made a significant concession by meeting you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a more substantial increase from your end. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, my budget for this product is closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad we're having an open and transparent conversation. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $825,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $25,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the added maintenance package. However, I need to be upfront with you - I've also been exploring other options. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a price point that aligns better with my budget.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm only able to justify $760,000 for this product. This is my final offer.",760000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have other options, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000, even with the maintenance package. I'm willing to throw in an additional concession - I'll give you a 2-year warranty, which is a $10,000 value, on top of the maintenance package. I'm confident that this is a fair deal, and I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",825000.0,Alice,9,
