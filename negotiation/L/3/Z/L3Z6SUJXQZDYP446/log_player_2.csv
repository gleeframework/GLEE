"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer of $14,000 allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to Alice's value of $12,000. By offering $13,000, he shows he's serious about buying but is still trying to negotiate a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and ending up buying from John for $15,000 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer ensures a purchase at a reasonable price."
