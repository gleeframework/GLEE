"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about we bring it down significantly?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the initial price was too high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, but I'm not going any lower than that.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $750,000, but I'm not budging any further.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement.  How about we settle at $700,000?  That's a strong offer, and it saves you time finding another buyer.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to meet you at $725,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",725000.0,Alice,7,
