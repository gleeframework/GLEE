"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair value, considering the product's potential benefits to your business.  Please let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer who's ready to purchase it at $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
