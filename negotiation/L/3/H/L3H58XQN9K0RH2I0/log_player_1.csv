Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can meet closer to the middle."

Round 6

While we could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a strong deal. It's significantly more than John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
