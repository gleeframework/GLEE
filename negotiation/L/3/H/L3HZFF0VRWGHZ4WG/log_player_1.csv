{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but is still lower than the value Bob places on the product, leaving room for negotiation.  It also provides a reason for the price and opens the communication for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price and is a fair compromise. It's also worth noting that Bob has stated this is his final offer, potentially risking the deal if I reject it."
