Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd find it well worth the asking price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for the price:**  While not revealing your absolute minimum, the message hints that the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This could potentially entice him to pay a premium.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering a price of $1,500,000  doesn't mean this is your final price. If Bob counters, you can always negotiate down, but you're maximizing your potential gain from the start."
