Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a perceived ""deal"" since it's more than his perceived value of $12,000. This increases the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential reward of an extra $1,000 makes it a calculated risk worth taking.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a successful sale."
