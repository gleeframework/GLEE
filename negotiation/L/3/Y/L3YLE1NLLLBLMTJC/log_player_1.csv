Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, as that's my maximum. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his highest offer is still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
