"I understand that you're looking to keep your investment within budget, Bob. However, I've got to make sure I get a good deal on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $17000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $17200, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",17200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one last concession to try to get a deal done. I can meet you at $17000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can shake on it. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",17000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to make one last push to get the price I want. I can meet you at $17200, but that's it. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. I'm not getting any younger, and I've got other interested parties waiting in the wings.",17200.0,Alice,9,
