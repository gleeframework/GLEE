Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $130.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125.  Since you can get the product for $120 from John, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the $5."
