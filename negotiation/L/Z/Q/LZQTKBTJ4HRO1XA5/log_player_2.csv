(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $895,000 is only $5,000 more than my last counteroffer. While I'd love to get it for $890,000, I'm worried that if I reject her offer, we may not be able to reach a deal before I have to buy from John. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that's still within my budget."
