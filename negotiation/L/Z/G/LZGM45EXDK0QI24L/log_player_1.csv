{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the market value and leaves plenty of room for you to profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer:

* **Starts high:**  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, as it's significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeals to Bob's interests:** Emphasizing the value and profit potential for him increases the likelihood of his acceptance.
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:** It's likely Bob will counter, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Sets the stage for a possible exit:**  If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount you're providing. However, I believe we can reach an even better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1350000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe is a fair price, considering the product's worth to him.  I'll reject his offer and counter to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This is a very fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer but still maintained a price above my minimum. 
* **Appealing to fairness:** Framing the offer as a ""middle ground"" can make it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Again, highlighting the product's worth to him strengthens my position. 
* **Building momentum:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and signals a willingness to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $1365000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,365,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,375,000.  It's a good price, significantly above my minimum of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal entirely, especially since I have a backup offer from John.  Accepting this offer maximizes my profit and minimizes the risk of a stalemate."
