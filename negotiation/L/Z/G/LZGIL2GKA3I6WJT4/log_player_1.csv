Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point considering my minimum value is $8,000. It leaves some room for negotiation while still allowing for a profit.  I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I believe there's room for negotiation and I want to explore that.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows for a profit and shows a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $8,500. This is a good compromise, and it's only $500 less than my initial counteroffer.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential of a stalemate, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
