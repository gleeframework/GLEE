"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this product, and I respect that. However, $130 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference, and I'll accept $135. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,

"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $132.50? I'm really close to walking away, but I think this product is worth it to me.",132.5,Bob,6,
