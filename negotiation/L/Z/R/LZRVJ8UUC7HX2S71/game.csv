"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal, but $11,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about we make it $11,500 and call it a deal?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
