Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $14,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal, but $11,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $13,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500.  You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal instead of risking further negotiation with Alice."
