"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the new offer. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. It's the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
