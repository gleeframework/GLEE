"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100.  I believe it's worth significantly more, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $120 and John will definitely sell it to you at that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of getting a better deal from her in the next round."
