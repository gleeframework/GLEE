Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I can try to squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price.  How about $16,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit, but $16,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $15,500 and close this deal. This is a fair price considering we're both getting what we want. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and it's better than selling to John. I'll accept his offer to secure the deal."
