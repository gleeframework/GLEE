"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think I can only go up to $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I'm offering. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,100,000, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still not close enough for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of this product.  It's our last chance to reach a deal before I have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. I've made several concessions and it's clear that we are not going to agree on a price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a price I'm happy with, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
