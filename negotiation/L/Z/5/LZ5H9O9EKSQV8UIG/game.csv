"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think I can only go up to $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I'm offering. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,100,000, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this compromise?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still not close enough for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of this product.  It's our last chance to reach a deal before I have to explore other options.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $1,000,000.",950000.0,Bob,6,
