"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000. What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $9,000? This price is still well below my initial offer, and it reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value we both place on the product. It's a win-win for both of us!  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,5,
