"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially get the product for less than $95.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's a good idea to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm starting with a $10 reduction from Alice's initial offer. This is a significant enough discount to show I'm serious about negotiating, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still willing to try and get a better price. I'm not ready to give up yet, especially since I have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal.  Since Alice rejected my previous offer, I need to be a bit more realistic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to my limit, I'm still not willing to give up on getting a better deal. I have time on my side and John as a backup. I'll see if I can get Alice to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This is a good middle ground between Alice's current offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping that this time, Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice is now offering a price that is close to my limit. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers with only a few rounds left. It's time to accept and secure the product."
