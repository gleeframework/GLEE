"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,200,000. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
