Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than Bob's estimation. 
* **Alternative:**  Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I still get a fair price.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  I am prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
