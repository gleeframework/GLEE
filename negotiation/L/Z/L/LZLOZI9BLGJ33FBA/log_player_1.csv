Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $120 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $120 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price gives you some space to negotiate further if Bob rejects your initial offer. 

Let me know how the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 isn't ideal, it's still a good deal considering:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $90 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer:**  There's a risk that further negotiation with Bob could result in a lower price, or even a breakdown in the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** You can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation falls apart. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
