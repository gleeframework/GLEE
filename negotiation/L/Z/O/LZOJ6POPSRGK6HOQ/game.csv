"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique product. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11500. This is a fair price considering we are both trying to find a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11500. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
