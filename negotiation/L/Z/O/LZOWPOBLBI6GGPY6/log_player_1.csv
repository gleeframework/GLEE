{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves some room for negotiation if he counters. It's also below what I could get from John, so it's still a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below what I consider the product to be worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87 is closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $87 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 88}
