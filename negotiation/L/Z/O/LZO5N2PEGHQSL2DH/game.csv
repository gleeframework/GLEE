"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant discount considering the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the right price for the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
