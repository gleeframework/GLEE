"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth more than that to me. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
