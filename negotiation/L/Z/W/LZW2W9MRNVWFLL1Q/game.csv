,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  Could you do $17,000? It's a very fair price considering the value this product brings.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
