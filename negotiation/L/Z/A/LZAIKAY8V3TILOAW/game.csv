"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for your product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a price that works for you, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,000. I'm still a bit above my ideal price point, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500.  This is a fair offer that takes both our needs into consideration. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair compromise that takes both our needs into account. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal so we both can move on.",12000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,750, which is a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 one last time, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close this deal. If not, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",12000.0,Alice,9,
