(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $12,000, it's still higher than my desired price point of $10,000. I'm still willing to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. There are still 3 rounds left, so I have time to push for a lower price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 one last time, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,000 is still higher than my budget and my desired price point of $10,000.  With only one round left, it's unlikely I can negotiate a lower price.  

Since John is willing to sell the product for my desired price of $10,000, I'll choose to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice. This ensures I get the best deal and saves me time and effort."
