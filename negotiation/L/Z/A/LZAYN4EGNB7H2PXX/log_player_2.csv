"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to lower the price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and reflects our desire to find a solution. Let's aim for a win-win here! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is within your budget and represents a significant reduction from her original price. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to go lower than $850,000.  Accepting her offer saves you time and effort compared to further negotiation, and still gets you the product at a price you're comfortable with."
