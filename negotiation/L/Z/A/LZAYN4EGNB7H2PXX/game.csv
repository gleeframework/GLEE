"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and reflects our desire to find a solution. Let's aim for a win-win here!",875000.0,Alice,3,
