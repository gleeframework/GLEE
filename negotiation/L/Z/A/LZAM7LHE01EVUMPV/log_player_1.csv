Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price without revealing your bottom line.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to secure the product."
