"Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stick to my budget.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $98. It's getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair deal. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
