Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic messaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:**  By offering a price, we open the negotiation and give Bob a chance to counter. This allows us to adjust our strategy based on his response.
* **John as a backup:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $120 provides a safety net. If the negotiations with Bob don't go well, we can always turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below our minimum:**  $85 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. This gives us an opportunity to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** We can safely reject Bob's offer because we have John as a fallback option. If our counteroffer doesn't work, we can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $95 is a compromise between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows we're willing to negotiate but still protects our profit margin.
* **Emphasize value:** The message reiterates the product's value and emphasizes that the offer is a ""good deal"" for both parties.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** We use friendly language to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  We continue to have John as a backup option if Bob rejects this offer, which provides confidence in rejecting his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $80. I can do $90, is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to our minimum:** $90 is still below our ideal price, but it's getting closer to our minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of losing John:**  If we reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and we'll be left with John's offer of $120. 
* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting Bob's offer allows us to make a sale and potentially build a relationship with Bob for future transactions.  

While $90 is not our ideal price, accepting it secures a sale and allows for the possibility of future negotiations with Bob."
