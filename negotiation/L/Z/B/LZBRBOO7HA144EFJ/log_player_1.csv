Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  This product is worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a fair price above that.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
