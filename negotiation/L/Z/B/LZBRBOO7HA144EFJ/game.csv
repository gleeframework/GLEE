"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  This product is worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a fair price above that.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? This would still give you a significant value over your minimum price. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
