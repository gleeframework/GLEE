"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,500?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,250 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we go to $11,100?",11100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum price, but $11,100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",10900.0,Bob,6,
