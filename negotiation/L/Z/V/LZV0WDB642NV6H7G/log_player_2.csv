"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than $150 from John, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You have a significant buffer in your budget ($150 - $120 = $30), and Alice is likely willing to negotiate down from her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not sure I can go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $115 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $150. There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice walking away or you losing time is not worth the potential savings."
