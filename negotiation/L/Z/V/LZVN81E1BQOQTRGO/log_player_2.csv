# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $12,000 to you, and to be fair, I won't let it go for anything less than $8,000. How about we start at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
