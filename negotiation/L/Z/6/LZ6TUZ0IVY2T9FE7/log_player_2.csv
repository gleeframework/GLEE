"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value. My initial price is $1200000.  I'm confident it's a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing your perspective. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price.  There's still time to explore better options, and you might be able to get a much better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've outlined, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects a compromise, and I believe it still represents fair value for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While you might be tempted to try for a lower price, it's risky.  You have already rejected one offer, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  Accepting this offer secures the product within your budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
