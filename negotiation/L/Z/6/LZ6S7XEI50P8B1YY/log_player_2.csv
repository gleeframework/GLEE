"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, it makes more sense for Bob to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John."
