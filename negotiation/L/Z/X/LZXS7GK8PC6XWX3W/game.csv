"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a good value for you.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $8,800 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $9,150. That's still a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere.  What do you say?",9150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,900 still isn't quite enough for me. How about we compromise at $9,000?  That's a good middle ground, and it gives us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,5,
