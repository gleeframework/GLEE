"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You want to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still too high. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I can meet you halfway at $102.50. It's a steal at that price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$102.50 is still within your budget and is a good deal considering you could get it from John for $120. It's also a good compromise from Alice's previous offer."
