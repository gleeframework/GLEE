"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's currently outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I can meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate further.  Rejecting allows for another counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's also a good deal for you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above my ideal price. However, it's getting closer.  I want to see if I can push for a lower price, but also need to be aware that I'm running out of rounds and could be better off buying from John.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives me one more chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can finally come to an agreement.  It's a significant investment for me, but I'm confident this product will be valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is still higher than my ideal price point. While we're getting closer, I'm getting concerned about running out of rounds. Given that John is offering the product for $800,000, I'm better off securing the deal with John at this point.  It's a sure thing, and I save a significant amount compared to Alice's current offer."
