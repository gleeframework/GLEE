"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's currently outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I can meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's also a good deal for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can finally come to an agreement.  It's a significant investment for me, but I'm confident this product will be valuable.  What do you say?",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal here.",915000.0,Alice,7,
