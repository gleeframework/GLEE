Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk another round of negotiation that could potentially result in an even lower offer. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a good profit and avoids further risk."
