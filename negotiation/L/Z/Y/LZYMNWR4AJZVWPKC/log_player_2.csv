"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you at a price of $12000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay $10000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $11500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's price, it's still higher than what Bob is aiming for. He can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit too high at $11,500. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to meet me at $11000, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11750? It's a bit more than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,750 is closer to Bob's target than John's price, it's still higher than what Bob is aiming for. He's willing to risk another round to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11250, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about the value you're placing on this product. Let's try $11750 again, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering extras, the price is still the same as her previous offer, which Bob rejected.  Bob is still holding out for a lower price and has a few rounds left to try. There's no need to accept the deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,250.  This is a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $11250, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle. How about $11375? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you're placing on this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice. Bob has already made a counteroffer at $11,250, which Alice rejected. This means Alice is unlikely to go lower than $11,375, which is closer to Bob's target. Although he's still saving less than he hoped, it's still a better deal than buying from John.  Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer to secure the product at a reasonable price."
