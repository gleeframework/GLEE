"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you at a price of $12000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay $10000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $11500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the best I can do at this point.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit too high at $11500. How about $11000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to meet me at $11000, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11750? It's a bit more than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11250. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11250, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about the value you're placing on this product. Let's try $11750 again, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $11250.  This is a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $11250, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle. How about $11375? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you're placing on this product.",11375.0,Alice,9,
