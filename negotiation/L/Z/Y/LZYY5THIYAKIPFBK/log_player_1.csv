Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as much money as possible. While we have John as a backup, getting a sale from Bob means potentially exceeding John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Consider Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it slightly above his valuation gives him an incentive to buy, especially if he perceives its true worth to be higher. 

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product at a price he might find reasonable, and we potentially make more than our guaranteed sale to John."
