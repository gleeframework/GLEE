{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong offer that:
    *  Is significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000 profit for him if he utilizes it right).
    * Leaves you with a profit margin above your guaranteed sale.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal."
