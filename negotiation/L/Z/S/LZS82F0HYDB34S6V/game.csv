"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $20000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $12000. If you're not willing to accept that, I may need to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell for $12000. I can do a bit better than my previous offer, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",22000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $22000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $15000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to consider this, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",15000.0,Bob,6,
