"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for this product.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,062,500? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is a tough decision, but I think it's the best compromise we can reach. What do you think?",1065000.0,Alice,5,
