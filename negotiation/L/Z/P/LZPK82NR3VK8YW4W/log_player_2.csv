It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price, especially when you have a backup option like buying from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better deal."

I'm offering $700,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my counteroffer. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $700,000."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still committed to getting the product for a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is a significant drop from her initial price and only a small increase from my last counteroffer.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and avoiding further negotiation.  It's a much better deal than buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only yield small, incremental savings."
