"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, how about $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, but $8,250 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  How about $8,600?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",8600.0,Alice,7,
