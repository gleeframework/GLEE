"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I know I can get it for $8,000 from John, and I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

I'm starting with my target price to see if Alice is willing to go that low. It's a fair offer considering it's the price I can get it for elsewhere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. But $9,000 is still too high. I'll stick to my negotiation and see if I can get her closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, how about $8,250?"",
""product_price"": 8250
}
``` 

I'm showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate by increasing my offer, but I'm still aiming to stay as close to $8,000 as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, but $8,250 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but I think I can get Alice to come down a little bit more. I'm willing to go slightly above $8,000, but $8,750 is still too high.  I'll make one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal but also that I'm not willing to budge much further.  It's a compromise, and hopefully, it will be enough to finalize the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close.  How about $8,600?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly not willing to go below $8,500, and $8,600 is a decent compromise.  It's better than buying from John for $8,000 and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
