"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,300,000 represents a fair price given its value, I understand you're looking for something closer to $1,000,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while recognizing the product's significant worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,075,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
