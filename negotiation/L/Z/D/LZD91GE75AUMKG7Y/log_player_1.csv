This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than your minimum, allowing for room to negotiate down if necessary. The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build rapport with Bob and pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, it leaves no room for profit. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is higher than John's offer of $12,000, and it's closer to my desired price point.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
