"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit. While I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium for it.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down in subsequent rounds, but I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $12,500. This is still a bit higher than his offer, but it's a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm hoping that showing some willingness to compromise will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round and see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price, $12,000. I've made concessions, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000 to ensure I don't lose out on a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and I've already made several concessions.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  I'm confident that this is the best outcome given the current situation."
