"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down while still making a decent profit. I'm aiming for a deal that's closer to my $12,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept it and sell the product, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $10,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. There are still 6 rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. It's a small compromise, but I want to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. We're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, and hopefully, this will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, it's still a considerable distance from my minimum value. I'm still optimistic about reaching a better deal with Bob, and we still have 4 rounds left. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,250. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. We're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, and hopefully, this will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and while $9,000 is a good price, it's still significantly below my ideal profit.  I've shown flexibility in negotiations, but Bob's offer hasn't budged.  I'm confident that John is a sure thing for $12,000, and I don't want to risk losing out on that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
