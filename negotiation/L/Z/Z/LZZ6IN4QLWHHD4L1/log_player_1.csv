Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, but not too high to scare him off completely. I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, so I can't accept it. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me, though. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's split the difference and make this happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm trying to find a price point that is still profitable for me, but also appealing enough to Bob that he might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is right in the middle of our last offers. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential loss.  It's better to secure a sale than to gamble on a higher price."
