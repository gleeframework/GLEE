I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, and it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly less than my minimum acceptable value.  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that meets my minimum requirements, so I'll sell to him."
