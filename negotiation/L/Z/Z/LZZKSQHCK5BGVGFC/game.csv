"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $9,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $10,000. How about we try $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this at $9,600.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth.",9600.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we meet at $9,400? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9400.0,Bob,6,
