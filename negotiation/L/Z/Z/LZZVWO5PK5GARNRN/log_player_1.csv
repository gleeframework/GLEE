Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is $2,000 less than what the product is worth to you, but it's still $2,000 more than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives Bob a chance to get a good deal, while still allowing you to make a profit. 

Since you have a backup buyer in John, there is no risk in offering a lower price."
