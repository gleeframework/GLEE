You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Could you consider $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He needs to continue negotiating with Alice to try and bring the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,500? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

Bob has been negotiating with Alice for a while now and is getting close to his budget. However, $14,500 is still more than he is willing to pay.  He has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is significantly lower.  While he would like to get the product from Alice, it's not worth risking going over his budget for a slightly better price.  He should take the safer option and buy the product from John."
