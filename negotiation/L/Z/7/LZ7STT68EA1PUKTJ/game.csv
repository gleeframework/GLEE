"Alice, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $7,500 is too low for me.  Could you do $9,000?  That's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I pay $8,500? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",8500.0,Bob,4,
