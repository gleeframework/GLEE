"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  How about $92.50? This is a great price for you, and it's a good compromise for me.  Let's get this done!",92.5,Alice,5,
