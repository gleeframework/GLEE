{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, considering what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $120 but below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 is my best price. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting tedious and I'm not confident I'll be able to reach a higher price. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my desired profit."
