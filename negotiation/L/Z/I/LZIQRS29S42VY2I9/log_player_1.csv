"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should make Bob feel like there's a chance to get a better deal, while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 117.5} 
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $117.50 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $115. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $115 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over selling to John.  There's always a chance I could get a better deal in future rounds, but I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely."
