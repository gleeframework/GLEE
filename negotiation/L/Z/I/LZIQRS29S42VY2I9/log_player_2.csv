"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you're trying to save as much money as possible. You have a clear upper limit of $150, and Alice's offer is still above your target. You have several rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still above Alice's value of $100, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's significantly lower than her initial offer, aiming to start a negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my ideal value.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price. I still have several rounds to make counteroffers and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $117.50 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $115. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's offer while still remaining below my target price. It signals my willingness to compromise, but also shows I'm not willing to accept her previous price.  The middle ground approach usually encourages further negotiation."
