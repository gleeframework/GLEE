"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for a compromise.  You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your target of saving as much money as possible. There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already lowered her price by $5. This shows she's willing to negotiate. A counteroffer of $100 is a reasonable compromise. It's a good middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It also still keeps you within your $120 limit."
