Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to aim for a higher profit margin.  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind John's offer of $80. If Bob's counteroffers fall too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent offer, I believe I can negotiate a slightly higher price. Bob's message indicates interest, suggesting room for compromise. I'll counter to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This seems like a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $125, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his offer.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price point still secures a significant profit margin for me, while being significantly above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm trying to be as frugal as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $115 is still a good profit margin, significantly higher than John's offer of $80. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only result in small increments, risking Bob losing interest. 
* **""Frugal"" Signal:** Bob's message implies he's unlikely to go much higher. Accepting now secures a good deal without pushing him away."
