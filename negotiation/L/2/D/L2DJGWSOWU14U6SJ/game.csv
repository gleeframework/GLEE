"Alice, thanks for the offer. I do see the value in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to negotiate a bit further. How about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $785,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",785000.0,Alice,5,,
