Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in buying it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $12,000 to Alice, and she's already offered Bob a price above his valuation.  Selling to John guarantees her $12,000, so it's in her best interest to reject Bob's counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we split the difference?  $12,000 is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? I'm really interested in buying the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still holding out for a better price. $11,500 is close to her minimum, but selling to John for $12,000 is still a more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $11,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $11500? I'm really interested in buying the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Alice has already rejected Bob's offer of $11,500 twice.  She has shown a willingness to negotiate, but Bob hasn't budged on his price.  Since John is offering $12,000, it's in Alice's best interest to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
