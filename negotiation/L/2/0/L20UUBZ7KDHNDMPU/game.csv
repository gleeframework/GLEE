"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $750,000,  which is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value the product holds for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still above my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. I'm not sure I can go any lower than this, so I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
