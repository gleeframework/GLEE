"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still represents a significant value for you.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target. Can you consider a price of $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
