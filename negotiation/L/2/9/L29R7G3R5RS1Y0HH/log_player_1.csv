"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While the product looks great, $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle on $6,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $6,750 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $6,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $7,250. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are taking too long and I'm not confident we'll reach a price I'm happy with. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob."
