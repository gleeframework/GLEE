"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
