"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get closer to my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,000 is below its true value. How about we settle at $11,000? I believe this price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I still think $9,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get even closer to my budget. How about we meet at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
