"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even higher than its value to her.  It's important to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my $10,000 maximum. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying within a reasonable range.
* **Gauge Her Reaction:** This offer will help gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's completely unwilling to budge from near her asking price, I might have to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still above both my budget and her own valuation of the product.  I need to signal that I'm serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $8,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:** I've increased my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate. However, the increase is substantial enough to keep the pressure on her.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  My offer remains comfortably below my $10,000 limit, allowing for some wiggle room if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help determine how much further down Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counter offer. I'm getting closer to your price range, but $8,000 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $11,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:**  $11,000 is close to my budget, but it's still more than John's offer. 
* **Final offer bluff:** Alice calling this her ""final offer"" could be a negotiation tactic. There's no harm in pushing back one more time. 
* **Leverage:**  I'm willing to walk away and go with John, so I have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I could meet you at $9,500. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price almost directly in the middle of our last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer Tone:** While I haven't said it's my ""final offer,"" the language implies that I'm serious about this price point.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm still prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge. This offer is my last attempt to secure a deal with Alice before resorting to that option."
