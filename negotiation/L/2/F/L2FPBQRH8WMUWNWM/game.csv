"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, $1600000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1650000.  This price still allows me to achieve my desired outcome while offering you a very competitive deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm getting closer to my target, but I still think $1580000 is a good midpoint. I'd like to make another offer of $1580000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1580000.0,Bob,4,
