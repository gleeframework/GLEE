"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident we can work together to make a deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can only offer $9,000. This is a fair price considering my financial limitations and the product's value to me. Let's work towards a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. How about $9,500? This is a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can agree on this.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $9,500 is still not enough for me to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
