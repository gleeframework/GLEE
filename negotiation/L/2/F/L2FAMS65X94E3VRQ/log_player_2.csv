{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident we can work together to make a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can only offer $9,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. How about $9,500? This is a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $9,500 is still not enough for me to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my budget, and we're running out of time. With only three rounds remaining, the likelihood of successfully negotiating a price closer to my target is low. 

Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees me the product at my desired price point and saves me time and potential frustration from further negotiation."
