"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Could you consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price.  While $12000 is tempting, I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $13500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12800? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can agree on this price.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate you making another offer.  While $12800 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price a bit closer to $13000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12900? This would give us both a good deal, and I could finalize the sale quickly. What do you think?",12900.0,Alice,5,
