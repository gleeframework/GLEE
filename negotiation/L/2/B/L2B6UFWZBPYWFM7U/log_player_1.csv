Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I'm in a strong position to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a 24-hour deadline creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, there's always a chance Bob could be turned off by an overly aggressive initial offer. However, the potential reward of a much higher sale price outweighs the risk in this scenario."
