"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I still believe there is room for negotiation and I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive to Bob and we can reach a deal this round."
