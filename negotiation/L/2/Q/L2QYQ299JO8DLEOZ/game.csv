"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my current budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this purchase if we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  $8,000 is my bottom line.  If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
