"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe it's a bit high, and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $7,500 is simply too low. It's not even close to my minimum price.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value you've stated.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500. How about we try $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  Let's try $8,250. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to meet us halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,250. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",8000.0,Bob,6,
