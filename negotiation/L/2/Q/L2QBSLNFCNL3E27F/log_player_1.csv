"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $1,000 gap allows for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of value.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive and friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is valued at $10000 to you. Based on that, I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob. There are 8 rounds remaining, and I can still potentially reach a price closer to my target.
* **John as a Safety Net:** While John's offer is a decent backup, I'm not yet desperate enough to settle for a price that's far below my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between Bob's offer ($9,500) and my desired price ($14,000). This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable profit.
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Positive and Open Tone:** Maintaining a positive and open tone encourages further discussion and helps build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product to you, I would like to propose a price of $11000. This seems to be a fair compromise between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's still below my target.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  With 6 rounds left, I have enough time to push for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired profit of $14,000.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me leverage to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $11,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm raising the price by a small amount ($500) from Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to highlight why a higher price is justified.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:**  Using a positive and collaborative tone keeps the negotiation friendly and encourages Bob to continue discussing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product to you, I would like to propose a price of $11000. This seems to be a fair compromise between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is increasing to reach a deal.
* **Acceptable Offer:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $10,000.
* **No Guarantee of Higher Offer:** There's no guarantee that I can get a significantly higher price in the remaining rounds. 

It's important to remember that negotiation is a balance of achieving your desired outcome and managing risk.  While I would prefer to sell for closer to my target price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of getting a lower offer or running out of time."
