"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a great opportunity to own a valuable item that's worth $100 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. Would you like to make a purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $100 from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $87.50. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $87.50 is still a good deal for you, as it's lower than what John is selling it for.  It's also closer to your ideal price point. It's a good move to accept her offer."
