{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $120. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob, as he can still buy the product from John at his maximum price."
