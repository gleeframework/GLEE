"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1350000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  While I'm flexible, $1250000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $1300000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
