{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great deal for a high-quality product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $10,000 but below your minimum of $12,000. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000.  How about $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $10,500 is above Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'd like to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
