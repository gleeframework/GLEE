Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $100. I think you'll find it's a steal at this value."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to pay up to $80 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price. Accepting ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
