"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, considering I'm offering you a significant profit, and it's within my budget.  Let's close the deal!",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's a good profit for you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
