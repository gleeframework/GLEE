"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's better to reject and see if we can get a lower price.  We have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so we're in a good position to negotiate."
