Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth your investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $15,000, knowing it's likely more than Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive messaging:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while staying open to negotiation. I can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $12,500 is still a decent price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counter-offer and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit far off from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return on your investment. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm making a counteroffer of $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a good price.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value of the product and encourage Bob to agree.
* **Focusing on the value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a ""significant opportunity"" and highlighting potential returns.

This approach aims to find a middle ground and increase the likelihood of a successful deal without jeopardizing my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my bottom line.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. 

* **Balancing risk and reward:**  The potential loss from further negotiation is high, as Bob might walk away entirely.
* **Securing a good price:** $12,800 is still a decent price, especially considering the possibility of selling to John for only $10,000. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision to maximize my potential earnings in this situation."
