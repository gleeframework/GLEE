Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, channeling your inner Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  I'm confident it will be immensely valuable to you.  Given its significance, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:**  Alice starts by emphasizing the exclusivity and value of the product, piquing Bob's interest.
* **Confident but not aggressive:** The message avoids sounding desperate or pushy. 
* **Higher starting point:** By starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, Alice leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Fallback option:** Alice has the security of John's offer, so she can confidently negotiate from a position of strength.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  The ideal offer depends on factors like:

* **Bob's personality:** Is he known to be a tough negotiator? 
* **Your risk tolerance:** Are you willing to risk losing the deal to potentially gain more? 
* **The product's uniqueness:** Is it truly one-of-a-kind, giving Alice more leverage?"
