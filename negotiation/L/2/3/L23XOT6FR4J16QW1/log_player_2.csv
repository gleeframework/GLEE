"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $135?  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal. It's within my budget and saves me $15 compared to buying from John.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price isn't worth it."
