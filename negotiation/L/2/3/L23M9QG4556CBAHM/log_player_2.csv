"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,150,000 is still above Bob's desired target.  There's still room for negotiation to try and get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is closer to Bob's target price and a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a slight further reduction."
