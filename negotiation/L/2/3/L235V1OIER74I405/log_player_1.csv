"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and ensures I'm making a good profit while still being competitive.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility while still keeping my offer significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair and could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject this offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm dropping the price further to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price, considering my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000. I hope Bob will finally accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I don't want to risk losing this deal and potentially having to sell to John for the same price. I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
