"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to get a better deal. You can counteroffer Alice and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $11,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

While $11,500 is more than you wanted to pay, it's still a good deal for you and you save $500 compared to buying from John."
