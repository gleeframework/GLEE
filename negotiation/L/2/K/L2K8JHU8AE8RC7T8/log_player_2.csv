"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I believe it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice's offer is $200.  It's way too high.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $170. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a better price.  John is still a reliable alternative, so there's no need to rush into accepting a deal that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $170 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $120?  That would be a good middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
