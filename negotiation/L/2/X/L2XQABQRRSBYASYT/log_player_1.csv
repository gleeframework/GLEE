"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to see if I can get a good deal.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, as I want to keep Bob interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $130 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $170.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 170} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still above my minimum.  I'm also trying to emphasize finding a mutually agreeable price to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $170 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $150.  That's my final offer, let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose him as a buyer, or end up selling to John for the same price."
