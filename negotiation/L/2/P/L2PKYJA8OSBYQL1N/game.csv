"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a great deal. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you the product for $14,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm offering you the product for $13,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my budget.  How about $12,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you the product for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,7,
