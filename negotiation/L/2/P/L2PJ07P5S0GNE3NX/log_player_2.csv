As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $775,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $800,000.  Further haggling is unlikely to get you a much better deal, and you risk pushing her away entirely. Accepting at $825,000 secures you a decent discount from John's price."
