"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $775,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
