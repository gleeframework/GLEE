Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the message hints at openness to discussion (""fair deal""). 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I still get my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of flexibility to increase the chances of a successful sale at a price significantly higher than my minimum."
