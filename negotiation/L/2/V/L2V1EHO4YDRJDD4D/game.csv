"I appreciate the value you see in this product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $1,700,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you consider $1,600,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
