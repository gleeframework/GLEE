"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable for your business. I'm asking for $2000000 for it.  This is a firm offer, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potential counteroffers.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is way outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a substantial amount. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value of the product to my business.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to come down to $1200000.  This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1200000 is still more than I can afford. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000.  This is my absolute limit, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's potential. I'm eager to make a deal, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",800000.0,Bob,4,
