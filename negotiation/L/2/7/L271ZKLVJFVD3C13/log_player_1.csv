Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is way outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a substantial amount. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value of the product to my business.  Let me know your thoughts.
