"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've indicated you value it at $1,200,000.  I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her asking price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the same product from John for $1,200,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob."
