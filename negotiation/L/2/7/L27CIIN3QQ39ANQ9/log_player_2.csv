"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it! Would you like to purchase it from me for $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While $13,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice might be willing to lower her price closer to her own valuation of $12,000. By rejecting the initial offer, you open the possibility for a better deal."
