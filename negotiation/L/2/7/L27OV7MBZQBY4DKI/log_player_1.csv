"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting high anchors the negotiation in our favor. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate down while staying above our minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The tone is collaborative, aiming to understand Bob's perspective and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Preserves John as a backup:** While we aim high, having John's offer ensures we have a safety net if negotiations with Bob falter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below our minimum of $800,000.  While his message emphasizes budget constraints, we have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. Rejecting this lowball offer signals that we're serious about the product's value and open to reasonable negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** We acknowledge Bob's concern but firmly state his offer is too low.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $875,000 splits the difference between his offer and our previous ask. This implies fairness while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Strong but Flexible:**  We reiterate our willingness to be flexible, encouraging Bob to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $800,000. This aligns closely with the product's worth according to my assessment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will agree. Accepting now secures the $800,000 and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or us missing out on both deals by being too aggressive."
