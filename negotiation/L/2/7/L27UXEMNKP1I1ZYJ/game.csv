"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and the market value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
