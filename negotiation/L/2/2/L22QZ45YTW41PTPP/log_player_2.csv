"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than your maximum willingness to pay of $10,000. 
* While you could get the product for $10,000 from John, accepting Alice's offer saves you $500."
