Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me is around $1,200,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the slight reduction, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $975,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away in future rounds."
