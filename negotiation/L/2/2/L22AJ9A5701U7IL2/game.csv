"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  This reflects the value and unique benefits it provides.  Let's discuss!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it provides.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is simply too low for this product.  It's worth a lot more than that, and I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to show my commitment to a deal.  This price is still very fair, considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $950,000 is still too far off from where we need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975,000. This is my best and final offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence.  To be honest, $975,000 is still below my target. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",980000.0,Bob,8,
