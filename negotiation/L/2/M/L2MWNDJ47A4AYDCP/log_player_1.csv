Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also significantly less than the $10,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him a clear incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly less than the $9,500 I initially offered. I'm confident I can get closer to that initial price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that $9,000 is a fair price considering the value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $200 less than my initial offer. Given that he's unlikely to go much higher and I could sell to John for $8,000, accepting his offer is the best option."
