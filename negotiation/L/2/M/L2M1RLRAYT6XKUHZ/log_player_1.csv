"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for us both to benefit."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,900,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. We are aiming for a price closer to $1,900,000 and can use the remaining rounds to try and reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. There is no further room for negotiation with Bob, and it's not worth risking him lowering his offer further. Taking John's offer guarantees the desired outcome."
