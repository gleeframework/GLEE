"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Test the waters:**  See if Bob is willing to negotiate at all.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  It allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without dropping too low.
* **Show confidence:** Starting high suggests I believe in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better price. Selling to John immediately would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing some willingness to compromise. However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. This approach aims to:

* **Signal a willingness to negotiate:**  I'm not stubbornly holding onto my original price.
* **Maintain a respectable margin:**  $11,000 is still a good profit for me, considering the product's value to Bob. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** It allows for potential further counteroffers from Bob while still keeping the deal within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a better price, so I'm rejecting his offer. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'm willing to take a risk to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is another slight decrease from my previous offer, showing continued flexibility. However, it's still above Bob's last offer, and importantly, it's a price that I'm comfortable with. This approach aims to:

* **Keep the momentum going:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintain a reasonable margin:**  $10,500 is still a good profit, considering the product's value to Bob.
* **Put pressure on Bob:** It puts the ball back in Bob's court and gives him a chance to decide if he's willing to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I've already made several concessions and am not confident that I can get a much higher price from Bob.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal is high.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'm confident that the price is worth the certainty."
