"Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. I've already made a significant concession to meet you halfway, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need you to meet me at $1030000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
