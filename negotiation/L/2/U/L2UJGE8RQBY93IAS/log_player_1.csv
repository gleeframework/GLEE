Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** You're still making a profit, and leaving room for potential counteroffers. 

By starting with this offer, you can assess Bob's interest and gauge how much leverage you have in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.5 is close to my minimum, I'm not comfortable selling it below $100.  It's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk going back and forth with Bob for a little bit more. John is a sure thing at $100, so I'm going to go with that."
