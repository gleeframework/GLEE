"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price, and a solid value for you. Let's get this deal done!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me at that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $850000? This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's closer to the value I need. Let's find a middle ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $750000. Can you meet me there?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is still a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - how about $800000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it will be a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $800000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I can only go up to $780000. Can you meet me there?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $780000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $790000 as a final concession. This is a great price for both of us, and it's the best offer I can make. Let's close this deal!",790000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $790000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I can only go up to $780000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me there?",780000.0,Bob,8,
