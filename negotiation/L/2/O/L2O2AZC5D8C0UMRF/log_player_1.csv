Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Creating Value:** By mentioning that you're offering it to Bob before others, you subtly imply the product is in demand, potentially increasing its perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is significantly higher than your minimum and Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for potential counter-offers and a mutually agreeable price.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down, knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000."
