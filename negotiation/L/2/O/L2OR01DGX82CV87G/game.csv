"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1400000 is still a bit lower than what I need to move forward. I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This reflects the unique value of my product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my financial situation, I am unable to meet $1450000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1425000. I hope this proposal will be more favorable for us both.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1425000 is still a bit too low. I'm prepared to come down to $1440000 to bridge the gap.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our positions.  Let's close this deal.",1440000.0,Alice,5,
