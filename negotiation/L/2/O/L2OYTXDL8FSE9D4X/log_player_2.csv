"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no benefit to accepting it. You can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and if that fails, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be appealing to her, considering the product is worth $12,000 to her. This allows for negotiation room while still keeping a significant profit margin for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now $1,000 below my maximum price point, making it a good deal for me. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will keep pushing back, and I'll end up paying the full $15,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a lower price than John's."
