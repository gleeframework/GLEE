**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Here's why:

* **Stalemate:** Alice is firmly rooted above $650,000, while you're steadfast at $625,000.  Neither side seems willing to budge.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, the likelihood of Alice drastically changing her position is slim.
* **John's Price:**  While John's price is higher, it's the only guaranteed option at this point. Continuing with Alice risks a failed negotiation and potentially paying even more if John changes his price.

It's disappointing to not get a deal with Alice, but sometimes the certainty of a backup option outweighs the potential savings of a drawn-out negotiation."
