"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Show Confidence:** A strong initial offer demonstrates the product's value in your eyes.
* **Leave Room for Adjustment:**  The $1,500,000 starting point allows for significant downward movement over the 10 rounds while still aiming for a price above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my best and final offer, as I'm comfortable walking away and buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's claim of a ""best and final"" offer and willingness to walk away should be taken seriously, accepting $800,000 would be a significant loss.  We have room to negotiate and Bob's statement could be a tactic.  We'll counter in Round 3, aiming to understand if there's room for him to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your perspective, my valuation is based on the unique aspects and potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but not Drastic Reduction:**  Lowering the price by $200,000 shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  Re-emphasizing the product's ""unique aspects and potential"" reinforces its worth beyond a simple price comparison.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge from $800,000, we might consider moving closer to our alternative with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll be purchasing from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now repeated his ""final offer"" of $800,000 twice, and explicitly mentioned buying from John.  This strong stance suggests he's unlikely to move significantly from this price point. 

While we could continue negotiating, the potential gains from convincing Bob to increase his offer are likely outweighed by the risk of him walking away. Accepting his $800,000 would be a $200,000 loss compared to John's offer. 

Therefore, the safest and most profitable option at this stage is to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
