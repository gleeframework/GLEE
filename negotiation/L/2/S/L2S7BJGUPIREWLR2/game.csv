"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $750,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000.
