"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, as Bob clearly has a strong interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push Bob higher with my counteroffer. I want to maximize my profits, and selling to John is always a backup option if I can't get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,600,000.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his. It's still a good price for me and I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob a little higher.  If he rejects that, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,450,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I think this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'm going to sell to John and be done with this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made multiple concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John for $1,500,000."
