"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for you.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,750. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to close the deal.  What do you say?",10875.0,Alice,5,
