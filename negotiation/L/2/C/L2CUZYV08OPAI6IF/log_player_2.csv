"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget. He can get the product for a significantly lower price from John. It's in Bob's best interest to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price or purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to him and he can buy it from John for that price.  Therefore, he offers Alice the maximum price he's willing to pay, hoping to get a deal close to his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can still get the product from John for $800,000.  Bob will continue to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or purchase from John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. He's increasing his offer from $800,000 but staying within his budget.  This is a reasonable counteroffer that might convince Alice to accept, especially since she's already lowered her price.  If Alice rejects, Bob still has the option to purchase from John for $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Even though she has lowered the price, it's still not a good deal for Bob. He will continue to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or purchase from John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, aiming to get closer to Alice's price while still staying within his budget. This is a compromise, and if Alice is serious about selling, she might consider this offer. If she rejects, Bob can still purchase from John for $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget of $800,000. While the negotiation is ongoing, the price is not dropping fast enough for Bob. He's already made multiple counteroffers, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John for $800,000 and save money."
