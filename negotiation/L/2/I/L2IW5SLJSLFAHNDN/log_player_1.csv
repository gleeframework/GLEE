Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,450,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Value to Bob:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to accept a higher price. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone in my message is important to encourage a successful negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will carefully consider his counteroffer and my options.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I will counter with a slightly lower price.
* If I feel like negotiations are going nowhere, I will consider selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. There's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired $1,450,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and acknowledges the value of the product, suggesting he might be willing to go higher. 
* **Value to Me:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be my last resort, as I want to maximize my profits. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin. 
* I will continue to emphasize the product's value to him and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to reinforce his understanding of its worth and encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and enthusiastic to maintain a constructive negotiation atmosphere.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will assess his next move carefully.
