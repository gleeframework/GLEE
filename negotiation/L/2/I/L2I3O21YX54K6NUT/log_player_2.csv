Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I can do $140, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly hovering above our maximum price. It's unlikely she'll come down to $120, and we risk her walking away entirely if we counter too low. John offers a guaranteed price that meets our needs, so it's time to cut our losses with Alice."
