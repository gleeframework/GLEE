"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, so this leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's ambitious:**  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving me a chance to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy.

If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his response and how much time is left in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to close a deal, selling for $12,000 would be a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my value.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to raise his offer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $15,000, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,500.  This is a smaller compromise, but still shows flexibility.  At this point, I'm only $500 away from my minimum and I believe there's still room for Bob to raise his offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal and avoid having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation isn't going in my favor.  Bob is refusing to budge much higher, and I'm worried I might end up having to accept a price significantly lower than my minimum.  

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000. While it's not ideal, it guarantees I won't lose money on this deal."
