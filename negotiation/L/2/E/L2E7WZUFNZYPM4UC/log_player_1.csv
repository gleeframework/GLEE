Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your guaranteed price from John). 
* **Negotiation Space:** This creates a potential negotiation space of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000).

**Strategy:**

The offer of $1,450,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value for you while still leaving Bob with a feeling of gaining a good deal. It's important to:

* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the price more palatable.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While the offer is high, it's presented as a fair deal due to the product's ""potential worth.""

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You get $250,000 more than your minimum.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You still sell to John for your guaranteed $1,200,000."
