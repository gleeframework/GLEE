Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm aiming for a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Balance:**  I want to be aggressive enough to maximize my earnings but not so aggressive that Bob immediately rejects the offer and I lose out on time. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I have the option to counter or sell to John for my minimum price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum desired price:** While it's closer to my desired price than his initial $8,000 value,  it's still below my minimum $12,000. 
* **Opportunity to improve:**  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my minimum, but I might be able to get even more from Bob. 

I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, I'm looking for something closer to $11,000. This product is worth more to me than you initially estimated, and it would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my minimum price, suggesting a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** I highlight the product's worth to me, reminding Bob that there's still value in agreeing to a higher price.
* **Positive framing:** I use language like ""great deal"" to maintain a positive tone and encourage Bob to see the benefits of a compromise. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm still open to further negotiation, so I've left room for another counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $11,000. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my desired price range than his previous offer. It's a significant improvement from his initial offer and is within a reasonable negotiation zone. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially counter and try for a higher price, the risk is that Bob could walk away entirely, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $12,000. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and the time cost is a factor. Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other opportunities.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a decent price for the product and avoid the potential for a longer negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
