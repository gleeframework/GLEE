"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for $11,500. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still better than John's price of $12,000. 
* Bob's goal is to save money, and accepting this offer saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might walk away, leaving him with no option but to buy from John at a higher price."
