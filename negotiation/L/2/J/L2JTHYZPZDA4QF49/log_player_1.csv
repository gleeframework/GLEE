Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not losing money by offering this price.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have space to bargain up to your desired price.

Remember, you can always choose to go with John's offer if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer and you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,300,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial offer of $1,450,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,400,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,350,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway from our initial offers and consider $1,375,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to your desired price, and it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation. You're still getting a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher price."
