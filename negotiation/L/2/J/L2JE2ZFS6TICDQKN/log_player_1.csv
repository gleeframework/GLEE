Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

We're getting close, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better price from Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further. Accepting his offer of $1,225,000 is a significant profit, and continuing to negotiate might push him away completely."
