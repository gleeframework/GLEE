"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's compromise - I'm willing to drop my price to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $85 is a good offer, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $88?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",88.0,Alice,7,
