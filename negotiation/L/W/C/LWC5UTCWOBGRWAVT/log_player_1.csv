"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you at $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering its unique value and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high offer ($2,000,000) as this is a valuable product to me.  
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential to Bob, without revealing too much about my own valuation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is high enough to allow for potential negotiation and compromise. 
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, which will give me insights into his perceived value and potential negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off.  I'll reject his offer and try to reach a more agreeable price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to reduce my offer to $1,750,000. This reflects the product's inherent value and leaves room for us both to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's interest:** Shows respect and maintains a positive tone.
* **Counteroffer with a reason:**  The price is reduced, but I justify it by referencing the product's value. This sets a clear expectation.
