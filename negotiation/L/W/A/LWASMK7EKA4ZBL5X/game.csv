"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less than you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
