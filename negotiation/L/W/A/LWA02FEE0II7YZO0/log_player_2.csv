# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $15,000. Considering this, I propose to sell it to you for $14,000. This price reflects not only the product's quality but also the opportunity for you to secure an item that aligns perfectly with your requirements at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or finalizing the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or purchase from another seller in the future."
