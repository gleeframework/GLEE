This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to offer $750000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $800000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
