"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her product's value to her ($800,000).  There's a lot of room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $800000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000. It's also a fair compromise, as Alice is only making a $50,000 profit.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
