Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer of $100 from John.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Offering a price slightly above your minimum but well below Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood of a sale.  

By offering the product at $130, you give Bob a $20 discount (making it attractive) while you secure a $30 profit."
