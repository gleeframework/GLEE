Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set the bar high from the beginning. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for the best possible outcome. If he rejects, we can negotiate. I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, so I have a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum. I believe the product is worth more than $1,500,000, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer. I believe there's room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up slightly, and I'm happy to accept his offer of $1,600,000. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. While I might be able to get slightly more, the potential for a stalemate with Bob means that accepting his offer is the most logical decision."
