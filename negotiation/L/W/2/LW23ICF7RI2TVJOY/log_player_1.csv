Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you'd accept $100 from John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but offers him a saving of $5. This might be tempting enough for him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves a small margin for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to haggle the price down a bit."
