"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $18,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept $18,000 when you can get the same product for $8,000 from John."
