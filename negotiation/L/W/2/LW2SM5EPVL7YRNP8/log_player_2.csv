"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You're willing to pay $120 for the product, but you don't need to accept Alice's offer immediately. You know you can get it from John for the same price, so there's no reason to rush into the deal with Alice. You can always come back to her later."
