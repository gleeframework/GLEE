"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity!  I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business.  My initial offer is $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I believe its potential will more than justify the price. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $1200000 is a bit too low for me to accept at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1350000,  which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
