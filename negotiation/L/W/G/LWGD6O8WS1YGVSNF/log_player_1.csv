Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,800,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'll counter with a slightly lower price but I still want to make more money."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I've already had five rounds of negotiation and haven't gotten to a price that satisfies my minimum value for the product.  John's offer is guaranteed, and while it's not the most ideal, it's above my absolute minimum and eliminates further negotiation."
