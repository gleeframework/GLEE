"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is just way too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $175? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $145? This is a great deal for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,6,
