{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$80 is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is just way too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $175? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$120 is still too low.  I'll counteroffer.  I'm getting closer to John's price and don't want to risk selling for less."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $145? This is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum value of $150.  John is a sure bet for a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
