"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset for a price that's well below its true worth to you. I'm confident you'll find this to be a very beneficial deal. However, if you decide to pass, I have another interested buyer who's willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $1,200,000.  You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
