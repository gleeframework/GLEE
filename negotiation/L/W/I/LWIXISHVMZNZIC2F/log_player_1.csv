"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) and hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate. I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($100). I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest. I can do $95.  This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping that he'll find it more appealing and we can close the deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a little too much for me. I'm firm at $90. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move just a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I can do $92. That's a great price for the value you'll be getting.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

I'm going to counter with $92. This is a small concession, but I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference and do $91. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting a price closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100) and it seems Bob is firm at $91. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing him and ending up with John's offer of $100."
