"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a strong offer significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This anchors the negotiation high.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" without being specific. This leaves room for Bob to justify a higher price in his mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** We're clearly signaling that this is an opening offer and we're inviting Bob's perspective and potential counter-offer.

By starting high, we aim to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how eager he is and how he values the product.
2. **Create Negotiation Space:**  This gives us room to make concessions throughout the 10 rounds while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
3. **Maintain the Option of John:** We always have John's guaranteed offer as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still considerably lower than our target and even our fallback offer from John. 

We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  We signal that we're serious about the product's value and not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upwards:**  Our counteroffer in the next round will continue to steer the price closer to our desired range. 

Let's see how Bob responds to our rejection and if he's willing to move closer to our expectations in the following round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I believe is a fair reflection of its potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise that recognizes its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We've made a substantial concession of $200,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob. However, we're still holding firm well above both his offer and our minimum.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the ""true worth"" argument without being overly aggressive. This reinforces the product's value in Bob's mind.
* **Encouraging Movement:**  By making a significant move ourselves, we're hoping to incentivize Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,950,000. I hope this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer to $1,950,000, signaling his continued interest. However, we're still significantly away from our desired outcome.  Importantly, Bob is moving at a slower pace than we are.

Here's why rejecting is strategic:

* **Maintain Momentum:** We want to keep Bob engaged and negotiating. Accepting too early might leave money on the table.
* **Test Bob's Resolve:**  By continuing to reject offers below our expectations, we're gauging how flexible he is and how much he truly values the product.
* **Time Still on Our Side:** We have six rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

We'll make another counteroffer, but likely a smaller concession to encourage a more substantial response from Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, the gap between our positions remains significant. To show my willingness to compromise, I'll come down slightly to $2,050,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the value you'll gain from this one-of-a-kind product."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We've reduced our price by $50,000, a smaller amount than our previous concession. This signals that we're reaching a point where large jumps are less likely.
* **Value Emphasis:** We're continuing to reiterate the unique value proposition of the product to justify the price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By not significantly budging, we're encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial offer if he's genuinely interested. 

We're now halfway through the negotiation rounds. Our next move will depend heavily on how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm aiming to stay within my budget while still acquiring a valuable asset. I would like to propose a price of $2,000,000. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,000,000 is now a strong deal for us to accept. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price is well above both your minimum of $1,500,000 and Bob's initial perceived value of $1,000,000. You're securing a substantial profit.
* **Positive Negotiation:**  We've successfully guided the negotiation upwards from Bob's initial low offers. He's clearly demonstrating his commitment to acquiring the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a guaranteed win. 

It's always tempting to try to squeeze out a bit more, but in this case, accepting Bob's offer of $2,000,000 represents a well-negotiated and profitable outcome."
