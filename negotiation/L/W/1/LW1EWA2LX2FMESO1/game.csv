"Alice, $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $9,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Could you consider $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
