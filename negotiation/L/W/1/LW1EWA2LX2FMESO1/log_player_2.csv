"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product for $13,500. I believe it can significantly benefit you, and this offer reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,500 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $9,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Could you consider $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement, $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000. There is still room for negotiation to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
