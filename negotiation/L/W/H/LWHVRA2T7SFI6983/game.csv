"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering Alice, but $90 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 was a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $85? It's still a good deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
