# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The best strategy here is to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a better price. You have room to negotiate as you are willing to pay $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than her original offer, you're still willing to pay less for the product, and you have the option of buying it from John for $1,000,000.  This gives you leverage to try and get an even better deal with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering our both our positions.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still a little off my target. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's probably best to accept Alice's offer.  You're only $125,000 over your ideal price, and you're likely to get stuck in a back-and-forth negotiation with Alice.  While you could potentially get a lower price from John, the risk is that Alice will counteroffer with an even higher price or decide to sell to someone else.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product and minimizes the risk of missing out on a good deal."
