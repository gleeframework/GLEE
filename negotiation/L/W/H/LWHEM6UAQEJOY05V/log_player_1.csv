Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation without making me seem unreasonable.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, which allows us to find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While I'm not happy with his offer, it's clear Bob is willing to negotiate. This means there's a chance to reach a price closer to my target.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to show flexibility, but still high enough to be profitable."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit:** Even at $1,150,000, I'm still making a profit and exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to persuade him to accept my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages a closing of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering our both our positions. I believe this is a good compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than I would like to get.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can potentially push him higher with another counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob.

**Next Move:**

I will counter with a slightly higher offer than Bob's current offer, but still below my ideal price. This will keep the negotiation moving and show that I'm serious about reaching a deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still a little off my target. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a small concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility. This makes me appear reasonable and encourages Bob to reciprocate.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a compromise, appealing to Bob's desire for a fair deal.
* **Maintaining Profit:** Even at $1,125,000, I'm still getting a good price for the product, and it's closer to my target.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the conversation open, signaling that I'm still willing to negotiate, but not willing to go much lower."
