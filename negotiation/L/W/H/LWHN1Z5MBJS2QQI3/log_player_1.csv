Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's more than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to make a sale, $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500 to make this deal happen.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
