"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm offering you a discount. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. While her message might try to inflate the product's value to you, it's a good deal compared to buying from John."
