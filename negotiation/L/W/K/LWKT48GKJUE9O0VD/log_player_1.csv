"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). I have 8 rounds left and John is willing to pay my minimum, so I will continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $800,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly what the product is worth to him.  While it's not my ideal price, it's the best I can get without risking losing the deal completely. With only 6 rounds remaining, and John as a backup, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
