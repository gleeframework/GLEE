Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potentially mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, it will be enticing enough for him to accept."
