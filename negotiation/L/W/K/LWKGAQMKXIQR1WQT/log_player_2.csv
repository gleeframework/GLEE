Alice's offer is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a little higher, but not all the way to $160. It's time to counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $152.

While $152 is getting closer to my budget, it's still not worth it to me. I'm better off buying the product from John for $120, which is my maximum price."
