"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget.  There's substantial room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows me to start the counter-offering process and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired profit margin. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer starts with a significant drop from Alice's price, demonstrating my serious intent to negotiate. $850,000 is still a good profit for Alice, considering her product is worth $1,200,000 to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you placed on it, which is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you've placed on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject this offer and counter-offer again, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  This offer is a significant improvement from Alice's last one, and I believe it's a good compromise considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900,000 is below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, even though she is approaching my desired price. I'm not ready to accept yet, but I'm willing to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer.  My hope is that Alice will be willing to come down just a bit more to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for profit, and I'm willing to go a little higher.  However, $950,000 is still out of my comfort zone.  I can offer $925,000 for the product. This is a significant step towards your last offer and represents a fair compromise. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to pay more while staying within my budget. It's a significant step closer to Alice's offer, and I believe it represents a fair price that considers the value of the product for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $955,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $955,000 is still too high for me.  While we've come closer to a deal, I'm not willing to pay more than $900,000.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and have reached my limit.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed offer from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation. This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
