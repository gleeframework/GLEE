"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $135?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, which would be $132.50. Can you consider that?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $132.50 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference one more time and go with $133.75? That way we both get closer to what we want.",133.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $133.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $131.50 as a final offer. This is a significant drop from my initial asking price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",131.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with $131.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $132 and $131.50, which would be $131.25. Can you consider that?",131.25,Bob,8,
