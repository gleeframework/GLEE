"Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $10000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I pay $11250? That's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway, and now I'm willing to give you an additional discount. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
