"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $10500. I'm hoping we can reach a deal on this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $11200. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11200.0,Alice,5,
