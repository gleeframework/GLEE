"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it represents a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than that to me.  I could consider letting it go for $1,750,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, recognizing its potential worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,750,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to make a significant profit while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
