# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000. 
* Although you could get it for cheaper from another seller, you don't know if that seller exists.  
*  It's best to take the current offer and save $500."
