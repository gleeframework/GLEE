Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is too high.  I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, so I need to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start counter-offering."

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I'm confident this price still allows you a healthy profit, and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget. While she's moving in the right direction, I need to continue pushing for a lower price. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still significant.  I'm open to finding a middle ground, so I'm proposing $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high at $1,000,000.  It's getting closer to my budget, but I'm determined to get it below $900,000. I'll reject this offer and see if she'll come down further."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer of $975,000 is still higher than my target.  I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation and possibly losing the product.  John has offered me the product at my target price of $800,000, so I'll take his offer and secure the purchase."
