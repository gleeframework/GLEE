"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I'm confident this price still allows you a healthy profit, and would be a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  To move us closer, I'm willing to consider $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm feeling very confident about this product, but I need to stay within my financial limits.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates my sincere desire to finalize this deal.
