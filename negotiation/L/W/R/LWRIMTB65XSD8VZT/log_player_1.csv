Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point as it's above the minimum I'm willing to accept ($100) and leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is interested at this price, and we can go from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise that's closer to my ideal price and still potentially attractive to Bob. It gives him a better deal than my initial offer while ensuring I don't go below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum price requirement.  I can always try negotiating with Bob again in the future if he becomes more willing to pay."
