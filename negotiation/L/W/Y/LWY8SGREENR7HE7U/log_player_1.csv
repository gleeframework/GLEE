"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to you than to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you wanting to sell to me, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  He's clearly interested, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher amount.  Selling to John for $8,000 is the absolute last resort, and I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,750 for it. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. We've only had 4 rounds, and I believe there's room to negotiate further.  Selling to John for $8,000 is still a last resort, and I'm determined to see if I can close a deal with Bob for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a quick sale, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,875. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire with only 4 rounds remaining. While I'd love to push for a bit more, Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely.  Plus, with only 4 rounds remaining, there's a real chance that if I reject, Bob might walk away, leaving me with no choice but to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
