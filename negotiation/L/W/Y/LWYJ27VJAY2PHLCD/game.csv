"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1000000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering its worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I can offer you a price of $950000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $950000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $850000? That's a significant amount for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. Considering the value I've already compromised on, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you've placed on the product, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still just outside my budget.  I'm really eager to acquire this product, and I'm confident we can find a sweet spot.  Would you consider $875000?  This is a significant offer for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're very close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $887500. This is a fair price that reflects the value you've placed on the product, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",875000.0,Alice,7,
