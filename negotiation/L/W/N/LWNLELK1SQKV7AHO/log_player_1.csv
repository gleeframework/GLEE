"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, leaving Bob with a $100,000 potential gain.  This should incentivize him to negotiate without immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still a good profit, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves significant profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to negotiate closer to my desired price after rejecting my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. We're getting closer, and with 6 rounds left I have room to continue negotiating.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm dropping my offer to $1,300,000.  This is a smaller step than before, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for much less than my target."
