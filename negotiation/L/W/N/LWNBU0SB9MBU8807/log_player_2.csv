"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price tailored just for you. Given its value to you, I propose we keep the price confidential between us. Let's say it's $95 for this exceptional opportunity. Don't miss out on securing this valuable item at such a favorable rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is framed to sound enticing and exclusive, $95 is still more than you need to spend. You know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially propose a lower price, getting you closer to your $120 maximum."
