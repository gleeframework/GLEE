"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's not, we can always negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price. I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm still confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,600,000.  This is another compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I believe the product is worth more than $1,300,000, and I have a few rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,550,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and it's getting very close to my minimum price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I'm still not willing to settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation. Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than settling for a lower offer from Bob."
