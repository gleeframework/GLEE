"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price. Since we have a strong alternative buyer (John), we can afford to start high and negotiate down. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price provides room for negotiation while staying well above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum and what John is offering. We have room to negotiate and test Bob's willingness to move closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair and firm offer considering the unique benefits this product provides."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're showing a willingness to negotiate by making a substantial drop from our initial offer. This signals flexibility but demonstrates we're serious about a higher price point.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $1,150,000, we're anchoring the negotiation closer to our desired range. Even if Bob doesn't agree to this exact number, it sets a higher reference point for further discussion.
* **Firmness:**  We're indicating a degree of firmness with ""fair and firm offer"" to encourage Bob to take this counteroffer seriously.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're aware of the limited rounds and need to guide the negotiation toward a favorable outcome within the timeframe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement closer to my valuation of the product. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our absolute minimum price, which also happens to be the same amount John is offering. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation at this point. Accepting Bob's offer secures the $1,000,000 and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
