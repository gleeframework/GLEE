"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
