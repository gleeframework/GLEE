Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're still leaving room for yourself to make a profit. 
* **It's a friendly message:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage.

**Why I didn't offer $150 immediately:**

* There's a chance Bob might accept, but it's also possible he'll immediately counter with a much lower offer, making the negotiation more difficult. 
* Starting lower gives you more flexibility to adjust the price as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer. This gives me a better chance of achieving a price closer to my goal of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $130 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Justifying the price:** I'm referencing my original offer to show that I'm not drastically changing my position. 
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is getting too close to my minimum of $150. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting stuck at a price lower than my minimum is too high.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees I get my minimum price and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
