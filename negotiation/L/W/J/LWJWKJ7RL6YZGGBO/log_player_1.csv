Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still exceeding my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than half of what I consider the product's worth, and significantly less than what John is willing to pay. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000.  This is still a good deal for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair compromise.  I'm trying to meet him halfway, but I'm not willing to go lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's a bit closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  If I can't, I'm always comfortable selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price, but I'm prepared to walk away if he continues to refuse to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially get a worse deal.  I'm confident that John will buy my product for a fair price, so I'm going to sell it to him."
