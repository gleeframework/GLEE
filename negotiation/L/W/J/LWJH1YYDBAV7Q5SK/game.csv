"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11000, which is a significant discount from my original price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $10500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still within my limit.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10750. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
