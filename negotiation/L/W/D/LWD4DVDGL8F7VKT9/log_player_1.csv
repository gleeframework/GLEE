{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but significantly below your minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still being profitable.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum valuation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my desired price but still below my minimum.  I'm emphasizing fairness to keep Bob engaged and hopefully move closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is still below my minimum, it's getting closer and the negotiation seems to be moving in the right direction.  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer as it's a good compromise and will allow me to avoid any further negotiation and secure a sale."
