Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price, I'm willing to compromise. I'll reduce the price to $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant discount from my original asking price. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than $900,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. It's better to secure the deal with John and save the $100,000 difference."
