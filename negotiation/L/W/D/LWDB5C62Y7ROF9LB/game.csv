"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price, I'm willing to compromise. I'll reduce the price to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer that considers its value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant discount from my original asking price. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that benefits both parties.",900000.0,Alice,7,
