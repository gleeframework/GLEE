I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's a significant starting point that reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident Bob will see the value and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,650,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm hopeful this will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, $1,625,000 is still a good deal.  It's within a reasonable range of my expectations, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether. It's time to close the deal."
