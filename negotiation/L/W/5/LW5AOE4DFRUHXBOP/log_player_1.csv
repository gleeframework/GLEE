Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer above that is profit.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering the product for $120 aims to split the difference between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This strategy has a good chance of being accepted while still maximizing your potential profit."
