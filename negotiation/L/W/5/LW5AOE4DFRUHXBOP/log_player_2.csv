# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $120

* **John's Price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to save $30 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, the potential savings are minimal."
