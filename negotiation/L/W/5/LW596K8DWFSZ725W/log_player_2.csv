"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its value to me, and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her product valuation, it's still higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility for a counter-offer from Alice that might be closer to your desired price range. If Alice doesn't budge, you're still secured with John's offer."
