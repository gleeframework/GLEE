Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm pricing it at $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. While she has a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($1,000,000) means potential extra profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also positions the price as a ""discount"" from John's offer, potentially making Bob more agreeable.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob's business, aiming to justify the high price.  The tone is confident but not aggressive, encouraging a positive response. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer."
