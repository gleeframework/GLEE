"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, as it's well below its true market value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. The product is worth considerably more to me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? This still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $8,000, it's more beneficial to  stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John.  Further negotiation with Alice may result in a lower price, but there is no guarantee, and the risk of exceeding Bob's budget is too high."
