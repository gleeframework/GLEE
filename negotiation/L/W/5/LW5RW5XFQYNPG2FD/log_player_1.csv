Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, as it's well below its true market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum price:** This makes it attractive to Bob.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still negotiate up if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's not too low:** You don't want to give away too much value.

If Bob rejects this offer, you'll have to decide whether to counteroffer or sell to John. Keep in mind that John will pay your minimum price, so you'll always have that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum.  I'll need to carefully consider the risk of losing Bob and the potential of reaching a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. The product is worth considerably more to me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? This still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $9,500 is still above my minimum of $12,000, so it's a reasonable starting point.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets at this price, hoping to incentivize him.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll decide whether to further adjust my offer or consider selling to John."
