"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the quality and potential of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $10,000 is significantly less than Alice's asking price, it's important to start negotiations lower than my actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer before presenting my counter. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  I'm aiming to establish a position closer to my desired price range, while still leaving some flexibility for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $18,000 is closer to a middle ground, but it's still significantly above my $8,000 limit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is showing a willingness to come down from her initial price, which is a positive sign. 
* **Leverage:** I still have time and the option of John's offer, giving me leverage to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. To be honest, my budget for this product is closer to $12,000. If you're able to work with that, I think we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reveal Budget (Partially):** By revealing a budget closer to my real limit, I'm signaling seriousness and putting pressure on Alice to make a more significant move.
* **Justification:**  I'm not simply throwing out a number; I'm providing context by mentioning my budget constraints.
* **Leaving Room:** While $12,000 is closer to my goal, I'm leaving some space for potential negotiation in case Alice is unwilling to go that low immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward about your budget.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. How about we split the difference again and settle on $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but the pace is slow. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with within the remaining rounds.
* **Alternative Option:** The option to buy from John for $8,000 is looking increasingly attractive.
* **Strategic Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Alice that she needs to make a more significant move if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but $15,000 is still a stretch for me. I can make one final offer of $13,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my best and final offer, introducing a sense of urgency.
* **Firm but Fair:** The $13,000 offer is a significant compromise on my part, but still allows me to save a reasonable amount.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice about John's offer without explicitly threatening to walk away. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice might reject this offer, but the potential reward of saving an extra $2,000 is worth the gamble."
