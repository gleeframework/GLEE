,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that $200 is a bit high, so I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $130 is still a bit higher than I had in mind.  Could you do any better on the price, maybe closer to $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $75 is just too low for me. I could consider letting it go for $100. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it works for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I could stretch to $80, but that's absolutely the highest I can go.  It's a great product and I'd be happy to take it off your hands at that price.",80.0,Bob,6,
