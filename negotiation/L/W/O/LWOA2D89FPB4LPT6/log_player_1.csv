Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that $200 is a bit high, so I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $130 is still a bit higher than I had in mind.  Could you do any better on the price, maybe closer to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $75 is just too low for me. I could consider letting it go for $100. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I could stretch to $80, but that's absolutely the highest I can go.  It's a great product and I'd be happy to take it off your hands at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than his current offer of $80.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, it makes the most financial sense to cut your losses with Bob and sell to John."
