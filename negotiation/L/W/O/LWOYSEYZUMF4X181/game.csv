"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is very tempting, but it's a bit out of my price range. Considering the product's potential value to me, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a good profit while I get a great deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1400000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm sticking to my original offer of $1000000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a good purchase, while you still make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1000000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'll offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
