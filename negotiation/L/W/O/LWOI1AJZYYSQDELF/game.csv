"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item that will bring you great benefits. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer, given my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is my final offer in this range, but I'm willing to consider further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",11500.0,Alice,5,
