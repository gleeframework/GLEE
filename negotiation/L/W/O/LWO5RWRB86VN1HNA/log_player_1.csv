Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999.  I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **High but Negotiable:** $14,999 is a strong starting point. It's just below your guaranteed price but leaves room for Bob to feel like he might get a deal if he negotiates.
* **Value Proposition:** The message focuses on ""value"" rather than just the price. This encourages Bob to consider the product's benefits instead of fixating solely on the cost.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn a higher profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
