"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There is no reason to pay more."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum price, and he's already made his final offer. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
