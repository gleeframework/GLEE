"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what others might offer, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can potentially save more money by counteroffering.  It's important to remember your goal is to save as much as possible, and there are still 9 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the realm of reason. It demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product but are also determined to get a good deal.  It leaves room for further negotiation while also showing that you are prepared to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $100 for the product. This is the best I can do while still making a reasonable profit. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to your maximum price point of $100.  You could continue negotiating, but there's no guarantee that you'll get a better deal.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for the best price you're willing to pay."
