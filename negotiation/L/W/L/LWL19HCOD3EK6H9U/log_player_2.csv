"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. I believe it's worth more than $100, but I'll start our negotiation at $150. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is exactly your maximum budget.  There's no incentive to negotiate further, as you can get the same product from John for the same price.  Negotiating with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it also risks a stalemate or her rejecting your counteroffers, costing you time and possibly the deal altogether."
