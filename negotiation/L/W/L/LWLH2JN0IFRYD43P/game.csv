"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what you're gaining.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $850,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my part and represents a fantastic deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
