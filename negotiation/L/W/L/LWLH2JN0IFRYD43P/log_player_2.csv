"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is her maximum price. There's no point in accepting it.  It's far better to negotiate, aiming to get closer to your $800,000 limit, and keeping John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This signals that we're serious about getting a good deal and aren't afraid to negotiate.
* **Strategic Lowball:** While $600,000 is low, it leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it sets the stage for us to gradually increase our offer while gauging her reactions. 
* **Goal in Mind:**  Our ultimate goal is to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible, but always having John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what you're gaining. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice came down $100,000, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, it's still too high.
* **Room for Bargaining:**  We have plenty of room to negotiate between our last offer ($600,000) and her current one ($900,000). 
* **John as Backup:** We can afford to push Alice a bit further since we have the option to buy from John at $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're moving closer to a reasonable compromise by offering a price directly in between our last offer and Alice's current price. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a significant discount.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for our offer, like ""meeting in the middle,"" makes it feel more collaborative and less like we are simply throwing out random numbers.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts us within striking distance of our $800,000 limit while still leaving some room to negotiate if needed. We're getting closer to the point where we might need to consider John's offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $850,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my part and represents a fantastic deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close, But Not There Yet:** Alice is now very close to our $800,000 limit. However, accepting at $850,000 would mean overpaying when we have John's offer as a fallback. 
* **Negotiating Power:** We still have some negotiating power, especially since we're willing to walk away and buy from John.  
* **Final Push:**  It's worth making one more attempt to see if Alice will come down those last few thousand."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal today. If you're able to meet me at $800,000, I'll accept immediately."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is our best and final offer.  We're making it clear we won't go higher.
* **Time Pressure:** By stating we're ""ready to close this deal today,"" we create a sense of urgency without resorting to aggressive tactics.
* **John as Leverage:** We don't explicitly mention John, but Alice is likely aware of the possibility of us buying from someone else. 
* **Outcome:** This strategy gives Alice a final chance to make the sale at our desired price or risk losing the deal altogether."
