"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $875,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still allowing you a considerable profit margin.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. While I want to find a solution, I need a price that reflects the product's true worth. My final offer is $825,000.  This is a firm offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll need to pursue other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
