"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  $130 is still more than your maximum price of $80.  You can do better by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? It's still a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $107.50 is still above your maximum of $80. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your goal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $107.50 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $96.25. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and you to still get a good return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 96.25}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, $96.25 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $115? This would still be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to accept your offer.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $115 is still above your maximum of $80.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. You're better off buying the product from John for $80."
