"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? It's still a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $107.50 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $96.25. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and you to still get a good return. What do you think?",96.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, $96.25 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $115? This would still be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to accept your offer.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
