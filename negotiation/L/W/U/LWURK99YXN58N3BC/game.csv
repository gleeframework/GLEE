"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right away if you're okay with it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
