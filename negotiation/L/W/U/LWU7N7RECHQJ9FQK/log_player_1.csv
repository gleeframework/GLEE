Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  You have a guaranteed offer of $10,000 from John. Offering it at $11,500 to Bob makes it highly likely he'll accept, avoiding the risk of him rejecting and forcing you to take the lower offer."
