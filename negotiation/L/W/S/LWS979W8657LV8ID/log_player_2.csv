"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this unique product for a price of $1,250,000. It's a substantial value proposition for you, and while I'm confident it's worth more to you than that, I'm willing to be flexible for a smooth transaction. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is below her own valuation, it's still more than what John is willing to sell the product for. You can save $250,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
