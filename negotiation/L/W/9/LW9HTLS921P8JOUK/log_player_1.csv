"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
