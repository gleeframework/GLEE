"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than your estimated value and I'll get a fair price for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.
* Buying from Alice at $11,000 is still cheaper than buying from John at $12,000. 
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might get frustrated and walk away, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it secures a good deal and avoids further potential risk."
