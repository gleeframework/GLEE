"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value, potentially exceeding $1500000. I'm confident this product can be a game-changer for you, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm willing to let it go for $1750000. This is a limited-time offer, so let's discuss the details and see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above his maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While Alice claims the product is worth more, Bob has no way to verify that. He has a guaranteed alternative with John, making it the more sensible choice."
