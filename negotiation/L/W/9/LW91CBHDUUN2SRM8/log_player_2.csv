Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in seeing if a counteroffer will yield a better deal."

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! While I appreciate your interest,  $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $9250? It's still a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you won't regret it.
