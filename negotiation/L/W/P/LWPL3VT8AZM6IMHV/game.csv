"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $800,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $800,000, so how about $750,000? That way, we can both get a good deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
