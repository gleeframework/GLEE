"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $15000. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob, but I'm not quite willing to meet you at $12500. I can do $14000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a product like this, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd be willing to pay $12500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $12500. I can do $13500, and that's as close as I can get. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
