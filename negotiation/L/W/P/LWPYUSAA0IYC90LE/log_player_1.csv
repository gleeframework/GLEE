Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a price point that's likely to be tempting to Bob (as it's significantly less than the $150 John is willing to pay) while still providing a substantial profit margin for me.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct and to the point, outlining the offer clearly. 
 
This approach aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
