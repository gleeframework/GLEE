"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price or simply purchasing it from John at a better deal."
