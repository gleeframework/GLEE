"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and meet at $6,750?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",6750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $6,750 yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $8,000. How about we try $7,200?",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're getting closer, Alice! I can tell we both want to make this work. How about we bump it up a bit to $6,900? That's a significant move on my end.",6900.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm a little surprised you're not willing to budge from $7,500. I'm serious about buying, but I need to see some flexibility from you too. What if we settle on $7,100? It's a fair compromise, and we can wrap this up today.",7100.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $7,100, which is $7,300. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",7300.0,Alice,9,
