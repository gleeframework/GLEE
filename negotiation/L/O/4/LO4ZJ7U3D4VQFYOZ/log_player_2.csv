Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $10,000, but I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we do $11,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $12,000 again, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice seems firmly set above $11,500, and her ""final offer"" of $12,000 (the same price as Round 1) indicates she's unlikely to budge. While John's price is higher, dragging this out further with Alice risks an even higher final offer or a stalemate."
