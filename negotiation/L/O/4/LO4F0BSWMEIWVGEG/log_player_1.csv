"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but also sets a strong starting point.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,800,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still reflects the value I see in the product. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to entice Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to what I'm looking for.  I still have time to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for less than I think is fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,600,000.  This is a further compromise, and it's getting closer to his last offer.  I'm hoping that by meeting him halfway, we can finally reach an agreement.  I'm still confident in the value of my product, but I'm also aware that time is running out and I don't want to miss out on a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting significantly lower than my minimum. With only 4 rounds left,  I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price.  While it's not ideal to sell for my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further risk of Bob lowering his offers."
