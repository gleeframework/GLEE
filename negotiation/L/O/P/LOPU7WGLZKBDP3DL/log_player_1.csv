{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. It's also lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept.  

By including a message, you initiate a friendly negotiation and make Bob feel valued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I want to see if I can push for a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  I believe this price is still fair considering the value this product brings to your business."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the same price I mentioned in my initial counteroffer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price, and continuing the negotiation risks Bob backing out entirely. Therefore, accepting this offer is the most sensible option."
