"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $700,000? That would be a good compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
