"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a strong offer that's significantly above your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer is a way to assess Bob's willingness to engage in a potentially tough negotiation. His response will give you valuable information about his perception of the product's worth. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** You have a strong alternative buyer (John) lined up, so you can afford to be more assertive in your opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. After evaluating its value, I am proposing a purchase price of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($800,000), indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on $100,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Early Stage:** It's still early in the negotiation process. Rejecting this offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a price closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, I'm seeking a price closer to $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By lowering your price from $1,800,000 to $1,500,000, you demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.  
* **Still Above Bob's Offer:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial proposal.
* **Balancing Act:** You are mindful of John's offer but believe there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a purchase price of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 shows significant movement from his initial proposal and is getting closer to the guaranteed offer from John. 
* **Potential Upside:**  While the difference is narrowing, there's still a potential $150,000 gain by continuing the negotiation with Bob.
* **Calculated Risk:**  You are willing to engage in a bit more risk at this stage, believing that Bob might be willing to go higher, especially if he senses you might walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position.  To be candid, I have another interested buyer, but I'd prefer to reach an agreement with you. How about we settle at $1,425,000? That's a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1425000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of scarcity and time pressure, potentially pushing Bob to make a more decisive move.
* **Compromise with a Twist:** Presenting the offer as a ""significant compromise"" frames it favorably while still remaining above John's offer. 
* **Strategic Midpoint:** This counteroffer sits almost directly between Bob's last offer and your previous ask, signaling a willingness to meet halfway while still pushing for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a purchase price of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now $200,000 higher than John's guaranteed offer.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks alienating Bob, especially after he's made several concessions. 
* **Securing a Strong Profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit above your minimum acceptable price, making it a wise business decision."
