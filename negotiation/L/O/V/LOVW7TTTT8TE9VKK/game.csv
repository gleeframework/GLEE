"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm confident we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get the deal done.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $10200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $8000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $10000, and that's my final offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $9800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $8000. Let's see if we can find a way to meet in the middle.",9800.0,Alice,7,
