"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $1,000,000.  This is the absolute highest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us. It's a win-win situation as I'm happy to make the purchase and you're able to sell the product.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this point.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
