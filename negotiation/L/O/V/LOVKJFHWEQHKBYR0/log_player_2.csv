"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price, potentially getting closer to his goal of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $1,000,000.  This is the absolute highest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us. It's a win-win situation as I'm happy to make the purchase and you're able to sell the product. "", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Given that there are limited rounds remaining and Bob can secure the product for his target price from John, it's the most logical choice to buy from John. This avoids further negotiation and ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
