{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I highlight the product's value for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I use language like ""Let me know what you think,""  signaling I'm open to discussing the price.
* **Backup Plan:**  I keep in mind the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, or potentially get a better offer from John. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise.  
* If the counteroffer fails, I'll re-evaluate the situation and consider selling to John if it seems like I won't get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate that the product is still a great deal at my counteroffer price. 
* **Positive tone:** I use a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and positive.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll see if Bob accepts this counteroffer. 
* If he rejects it, I'll consider if I want to make another counteroffer, or if I should accept his offer (if it's close to my minimum acceptable price) or go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The negotiation process is taking longer than expected, and I'm not confident that I can get Bob to budge much further.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed sale:**  Since John is willing to pay $15,000, it's a more appealing option than potentially getting stuck with a lower price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and move forward with selling the product to John.  While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about $11,500? This is a final offer from me, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm clearly stating this is my final offer, creating pressure for Bob to make a decision.
* **Compromise:** While I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price, I'm showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Value emphasis:** I remind Bob of the product's value to reiterate that this offer is still a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I still leave the door open for further negotiation by saying, ""Let me know what you think."" 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this final offer, I will move forward with selling to John to avoid further delays and ensure a guaranteed sale. 
* If Bob accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a price that's acceptable to both of us."
