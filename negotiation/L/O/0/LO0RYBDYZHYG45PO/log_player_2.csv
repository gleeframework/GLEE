"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that will be invaluable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. This price reflects its true worth, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not sure if Alice's offer is the best deal for me. Since the product is worth $800,000 to her, I'm sure I can negotiate a better price. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price of $1,500,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for either of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a very fair price considering the potential benefits you'll receive.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit above my target price, but I'm not sure if I want to go any higher. I think I've negotiated as much as I can, and I don't want to risk going over my budget. I'll reject her offer and stick to my initial target price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a final counteroffer that's even closer to my target price. Here's my offer:

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
