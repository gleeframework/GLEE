"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that will be invaluable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. This price reflects its true worth, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for either of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a very fair price considering the potential benefits you'll receive.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
