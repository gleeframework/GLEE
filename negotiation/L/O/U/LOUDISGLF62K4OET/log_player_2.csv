Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you - finding a price that works for both of us is important.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than $10,000, which is John's guaranteed offer.  At this point, it's safer to buy from John and secure the product at the best known price."
