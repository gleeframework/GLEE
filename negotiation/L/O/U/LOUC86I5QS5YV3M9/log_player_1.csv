"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm starting with a price of $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) allows for some negotiation room. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone helps establish rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **$175:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but not too high that it immediately kills the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I'm looking for something within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I need to keep negotiating to try and reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Not selling to John yet:** While John is a guaranteed sale at $150, I still have time to negotiate with Bob.  There's a chance I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $160?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by countering with a lower price.
* **$160:** This price is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price from Bob in the next round.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of time. 

While $140 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise, and selling to Bob now ensures a sale with minimal risk of losing the deal entirely."
