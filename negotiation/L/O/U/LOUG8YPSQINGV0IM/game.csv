"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest,  $1250000 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1400000 to demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement.  This price reflects the true value of the product while still allowing for a significant profit for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
