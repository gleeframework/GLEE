"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1100000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below what I need to part with this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1200000?
