Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping he'll be interested in the product and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not eager to accept it right away. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I believe this counteroffer is fair and leaves room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and I'm confident I can still make a good profit."
