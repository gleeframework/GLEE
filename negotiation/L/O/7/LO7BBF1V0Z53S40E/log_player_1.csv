Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 reasoning:
Since you value the product at a minimum of $100 and have a guaranteed buyer at that price, there is no incentive to go below. However, to maximize profit, it's good to test Bob's willingness to pay a bit more than his perceived value. Aiming for $95 allows for a potential profit above your guaranteed sale while leaving room for negotiation if Bob finds the initial price too high."
