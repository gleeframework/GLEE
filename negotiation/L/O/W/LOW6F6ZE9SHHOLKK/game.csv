"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $127.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",127.5,Alice,3,
