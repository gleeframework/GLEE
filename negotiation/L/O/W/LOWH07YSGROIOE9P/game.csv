"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",780000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $780,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  How about $820,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you and would allow me to make a reasonable profit. ",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $820,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $805,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",805000.0,Bob,4,
