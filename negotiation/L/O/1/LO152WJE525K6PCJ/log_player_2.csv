"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it's a valuable asset that can be very beneficial to your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price.  You can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to meet you somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value in your product,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.  It demonstrates that you are serious about buying the product but are also trying to secure a good price.  $750,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it allows Alice to see that you're willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this price still provides you with a strong return on investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, but $900,000 is still quite high, especially since you are willing to buy it from John for $1,500,000.  There is still room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better price. You can make another counteroffer to see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still looking to secure a better deal.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that you're willing to negotiate and meet halfway, but still trying to get a good price.  $800,000 is a reasonable price that leaves some room for Alice to accept and still make a profit, while also ensuring you get a good deal."
