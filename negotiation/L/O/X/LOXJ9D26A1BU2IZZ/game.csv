"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9,000, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm making a new offer of $9,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
