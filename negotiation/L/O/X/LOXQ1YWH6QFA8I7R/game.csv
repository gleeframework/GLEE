"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product's value exceeds that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value your product highly, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $1,125,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's settle this â€“ how about $1,180,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on it.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a very fair price considering the value to you and my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
