"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering the market value and our initial conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? That feels like a fairer price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $750,000?  It seems like a good compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
