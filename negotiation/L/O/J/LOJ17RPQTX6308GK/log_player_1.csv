"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I could sell to John for $150, there's still potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a profitable margin for myself. 
* **Reasoned Explanation:** I'm providing a justification for the price and highlighting the value Bob will receive. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and open tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $125 is still a little steep for my budget. Could you possibly do it for $95? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Potential for better deal:** Although I could sell to John for $150, there's still potential for negotiation with Bob to get a better price. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($95) and my previous offer ($125).
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant concession on my part, encouraging Bob to reciprocate.
* **Maintain Value Focus:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to keep the negotiation focused on finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding. $110 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $100. Would you consider $98? That's a firm offer on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $98 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob is stating his offer is firm, suggesting limited room for further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  While I could try one more counteroffer, selling to John for $150 ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids potential for further rejection from Bob. However, I'm still willing to take one more chance to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm offer, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  Let's split the difference and go with $104. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 104}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is a final attempt to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still within Bob's range.
* **Split the Difference:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($98).
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need for a compromise to reach an agreement, suggesting that further negotiation may not be possible."
