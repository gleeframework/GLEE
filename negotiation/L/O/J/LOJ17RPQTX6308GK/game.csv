"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can make this happen!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $125 is still a little steep for my budget. Could you possibly do it for $95? I think that's a fair price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding. $110 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $100. Would you consider $98? That's a firm offer on my end.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your firm offer, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  Let's split the difference and go with $104. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",104.0,Alice,7,
