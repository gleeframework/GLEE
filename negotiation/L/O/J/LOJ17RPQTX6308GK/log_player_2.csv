Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can make this happen!

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your firm offer, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  Let's split the difference and go with $104. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $104
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, she's unlikely to go below $100. You have a guaranteed option with John at $100.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation and risking walking away with nothing."
