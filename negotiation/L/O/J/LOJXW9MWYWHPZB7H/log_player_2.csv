Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's uniqueness and value.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit above your initial budget, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's uniqueness and value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You have a few rounds left and a fallback option with John, so it's worth pushing for a lower price. You can likely get closer to your target by continuing to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  Given the product's value, I'm confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  My final offer is $1,500,000. This is the absolute maximum I can go, but I truly believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you've made a final offer of $1500000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is still above your maximum budget. You have two options:

1. **Reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further.**  However, this risks prolonging the negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely. 
2. **Buy the product from John.** This provides certainty. You can purchase the product at your maximum budget and avoid further negotiation.

Given the limited rounds remaining and the risk of not reaching a deal, it's more strategic to buy the product from John. You secure the product at your desired price and avoid the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
