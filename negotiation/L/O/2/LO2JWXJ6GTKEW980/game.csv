"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",16000.0,Alice,5,
