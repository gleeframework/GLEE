"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate down from this price. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his range and can adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my desired profit, but it shows he's willing to pay more than my minimum.  I'll reject and counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my target price.  Selling to John now would mean missing out on the potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.  $1,700,000 is still a good profit for me, and I believe Bob might be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired profit. I believe it's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity by rejecting it. Selling to John would be a lower profit."
