"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think the initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to go any higher. Accepting his current offer would mean selling the product for its minimum value to you. Selling to John guarantees you achieve your minimum acceptable price without the risk of further negotiation."
