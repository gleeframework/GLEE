"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $140 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is above his maximum budget. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a great deal for a product you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* While Alice's offer of $125 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. 
* Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $117.50 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. How about we settle at $122.50? That's a fair price for both of us and ensures we can both be happy with the outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $122.50 is getting closer to his budget, but it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.
* At this point, with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price is too high. 
* Buying from John at $120 guarantees Bob the product at a price within his budget, ensuring the best outcome."
