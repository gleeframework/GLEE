,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a great deal for a product you'll love.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $117.50 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. How about we settle at $122.50? That's a fair price for both of us and ensures we can both be happy with the outcome.",122.5,Alice,5,
