"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with his maximum budget and making a firm counteroffer. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but won't overpay.  By setting a clear price, it puts the pressure on Alice to negotiate or risk losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, $15,000 is closer to its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget than $15,000, it's still above his limit.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price down, but is willing to compromise a bit. He's increasing his offer, but staying within his budget and demonstrating a willingness to continue negotiating.  He's showing that he's serious about buying the product but won't be taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is indicating this is her final offer, Bob should still try to push for a lower price. He's already rejected an offer of $13,000 and can likely get the price down further.  Rejecting the offer will allow him to counteroffer once more before having to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to pay $11,500. This is my final offer. I believe it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best deal.  He's increasing his offer again, but by a smaller amount, showing that he's nearing his limit.  By declaring this as his final offer, he's putting pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale."
