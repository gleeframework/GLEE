"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However, $15,000 is closer to its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to pay $11,500. This is my final offer. I believe it's fair to both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
