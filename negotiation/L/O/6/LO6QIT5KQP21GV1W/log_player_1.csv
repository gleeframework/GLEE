"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  Given its incredible value, I'm offering it at a premium price of $1,900,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  My goal is to maximize profit. While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher gives me room to negotiate down and potentially secure a price well above my minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" and ""special"" nature, aiming to justify the high asking price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware of John's standing offer of $1,000,000. This knowledge gives me a strong fallback position, allowing me to be bolder in my initial offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the unique opportunity to purchase this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  His message indicates a willingness to engage, but he's anchoring his offer to a ""budget.""  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum while maintaining a margin for further discussion."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  It's clear you recognize the value of this product. While your offer is reasonable, I'm seeking a price closer to $1,700,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've come down from my initial offer, but not drastically.  This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to keep Bob anchored to the idea that this isn't an ordinary purchase. 
* **Pressure Point:**  By not going below $1,700,000 at this stage, I'm subtly increasing the pressure, making Bob consider the potential loss of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $1,700,000, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting serious with the ""final offer"" statement. However, $1,450,000 is still a significant profit margin above my minimum. I'll push a bit further, but I need to carefully consider my next move as we're getting close to a potential deal or a walk-away point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and reflects my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  I'm shifting the tone to be more agreeable and emphasize finding a ""middle ground,"" acknowledging his ""final offer"" statement without backing down entirely.
* **Strategic Concession:** A $100,000 reduction might seem substantial, but it keeps me well above the $1,450,000 Bob offered while signaling a willingness to move towards a deal. 
* **Time Constraint:** With rounds progressing, I need to increase the pace of the negotiation to avoid reaching a point where Bob loses interest or I'm forced to take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional considerations to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeated his $1,450,000 offer and called it ""final"" twice. This suggests he's unlikely to budge further.
* **""Additional Considerations"":** The mention of extras to ""sweeten the deal"" presents a new opportunity. While the exact nature is unclear, it opens the door for me to potentially gain value beyond the cash amount, making the offer more appealing.
* **Time Value & Risk:**  Prolonging negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away or my position weakening.  Accepting now secures a significant profit (a $450,000 gain) and avoids the potential loss of the deal entirely."
