"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, I'm working with a tight budget. Could you do $10,500? I feel that's a fair price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's try $11,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident the product will be worth it for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
