It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $1,200,000 when you can get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get the price down to $900,000. This is still a significant saving compared to John's price, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but we need to get closer to $1,000,000."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying from her, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is still higher than John's, but we're getting closer. Let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,000,000, which is the same price as John's.  If Alice rejects this, it's clear she's not willing to meet my price, and I'll go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

```

Alice is clearly holding out for a higher price.  It's time to move on and buy from John, who is offering the product at the price I'm willing to pay.  It's a good deal and a better alternative to risking further negotiation with Alice."
