"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $130. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135.
