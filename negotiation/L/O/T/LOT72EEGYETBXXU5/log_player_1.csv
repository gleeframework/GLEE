"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price ($10,000) to see if Bob is truly interested. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds.  This allows for a potential negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  Would you be willing to come down to $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired range. I want to see if Bob will go higher before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my desired price range, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can earn more than the $8,000 offer from John."
