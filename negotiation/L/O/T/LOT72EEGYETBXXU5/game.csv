"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  Would you be willing to come down to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 is still a bit low for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  I think that's a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,
