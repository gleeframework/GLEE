``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob is not satisfied with the initial price. I'm confident I can get at least $1,200,000 for the product, but I'm open to negotiation to potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer. While $1,100,000 is still a good profit, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that Bob is genuinely interested in the product and will be willing to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $1,080,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer again. While $1,080,000 is still a significant amount, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000, or at least a price closer to $1,100,000. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to accept $1,115,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come away satisfied.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1115000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $1,090,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, selling to John still guarantees me a substantial profit and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob that might not yield a better result."
