,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can meet you at $1700000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1700000, so I'll offer $1650000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1650000. I can meet you at $1680000, which is a compromise between my original price and your offer. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1680000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, but $1680000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1600000.0,Bob,8,
