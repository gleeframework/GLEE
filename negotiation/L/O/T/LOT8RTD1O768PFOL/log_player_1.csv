Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway and settle for $15,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $14,250.  This is a final offer - I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 14250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, as I mentioned before. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

It's unlikely Bob will go higher. Accepting $13,500 is better than risking a lower offer or having to settle for John's $12,000."
