"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway and settle for $15,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $14,250.  This is a final offer - I believe it's a fair compromise.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, as I mentioned before. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
