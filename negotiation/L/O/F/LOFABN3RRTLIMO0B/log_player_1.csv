"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you a chance to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is considerable, and I believe it can significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a fruitful negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to make a more significant reduction in the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,500,000 is a significant sum, we're aiming to maximize profit.  It's still early in the negotiation, and there's room to work towards a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This reflects the product's significant worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're coming down in price, but still aiming high. This counteroffer:

* Shows we're willing to negotiate.
* Maintains a strong position, not dropping too drastically.
* Provides room for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to reduce the price further. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers, but we're still a significant amount away from our initial ask and a potentially much higher profit. We need to hold firm to signal the value of the product and see if he's willing to go higher. We're not in a rush and have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges both the product's worth and your interest in acquiring it."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding firm:** We're sending a clear signal that we're not going to drastically reduce the price. 
* **Finality:**  By stating ""final offer"" we're introducing a sense of urgency and putting the decision firmly in Bob's court. 
* **Still above our safety net:** Even if Bob rejects this, we can always walk away and sell to John for our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob has consistently moved closer to our asking price, and this offer represents a true middle ground between his initial offer and our ""final offer.""
* **Strong profit:** While not our ideal price, $1,500,000 is still a $500,000 profit above our guaranteed sale to John.
* **Risk of pushing too far:**  There's a chance Bob might walk away entirely if we continue to play hardball, leaving us with John's lower offer. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
