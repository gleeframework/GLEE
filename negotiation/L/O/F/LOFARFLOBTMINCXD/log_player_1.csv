"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also aware that I can always fall back to John's offer of $10,000, so I'm not afraid to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm curious to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher. If not, I can always accept his offer, or go with John's offer if he's unwilling to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  It also puts the pressure on Bob to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to move closer to my desired price. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000.  This is a slight compromise from my last offer, but I'm still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to negotiate but not giving in completely, I can push Bob towards a better price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is tempting, I believe I can get a bit more. I'm not feeling the pressure to sell yet, and I'm confident I can squeeze out a few more thousand dollars.  I'll see if I can push Bob up to $13,500 or even $14,000. If he won't budge, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's current offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is getting closer to John's offer, I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can find a middle ground before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince him to accept. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. I'm starting to feel the pressure now with only two rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only one round left and Bob's last offer being lower than John's, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I would have liked to get a little closer to my initial asking price, but it's better to secure a sale at a decent price than to risk getting nothing at all."
