"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than both her valuation of the product ($1,200,000) and my maximum budget ($1,500,000).  There's room for negotiation. I should counter with a lower offer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. The product is interesting, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a strong counter-offer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying below my maximum budget. By anchoring the negotiation at a lower price point, I increase the chances of securing a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down in price, but it's still above her valuation of the product. This means there's likely still room to negotiate. By rejecting her offer and countering again, I can try to push the price closer to her $1,200,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I'm getting closer to being able to meet your price. How about $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming to stay well below her current offer. This counter-offer puts some pressure on Alice, as it's getting closer to her valuation of the product while still leaving me with some potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to meeting your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1,220,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly and is now offering the product for only $20,000 above her valuation.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller, and I risk pushing Alice away entirely. It's a good deal at this point, and I'm better off accepting it rather than risking a worse outcome by continuing to negotiate or going with John's higher price."
