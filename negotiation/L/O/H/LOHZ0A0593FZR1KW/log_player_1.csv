Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product. 

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of acceptance."
