"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to work together, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value it holds for me and allows for some profit for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
