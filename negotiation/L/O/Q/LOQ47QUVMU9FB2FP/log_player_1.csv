Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning other interest (even if indirect) creates a sense of scarcity and urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, hinting at its value and demand helps justify the higher price.

**Important:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit but comes with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. You have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so pushing beyond that involves a calculated risk."
