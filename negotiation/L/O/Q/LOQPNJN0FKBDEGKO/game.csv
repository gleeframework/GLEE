"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $2,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $2,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit much for me. I can do $1,300,000. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too low for a product of this caliber. I can go down to $1,800,000.  This offer represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,6,
