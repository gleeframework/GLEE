{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $140 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a backup buyer (John) at $120, so you're not desperate and can afford to aim higher with Bob.

This offer balances maximizing potential profit with a price Bob is likely to find reasonable."
