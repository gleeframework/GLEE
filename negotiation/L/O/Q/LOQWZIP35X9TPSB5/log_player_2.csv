"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our product to you. This extraordinary item holds significant value to us, but we understand its potential worth to you is even greater. We are offering this unique opportunity to acquire it at a special price of $1,200,000. We believe this offers an excellent balance between fair compensation for us and a favorable deal for you. We look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. You can aim for a lower price, potentially saving a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is appreciated, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you and a great deal for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product and understand your perspective. After careful consideration, we are willing to negotiate closer to your suggested price. Our revised offer for the product is $1,100,000. We hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations while still providing a substantial return for us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  It's still within my budget and a decent deal considering the potential profit for Alice.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my next offer or I might end up buying from John for a higher price.  Accepting this offer minimizes risk and saves a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
