"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $8000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $10000. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
