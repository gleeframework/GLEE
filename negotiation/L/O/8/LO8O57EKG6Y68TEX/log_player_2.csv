Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming for closer to $90, and going to John at $150 is still an option if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between our previous offer and her counteroffer. This shows we're willing to negotiate but also holds a firm line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line. Accepting at $105 secures a reasonable price for the product, significantly below John's offer."
