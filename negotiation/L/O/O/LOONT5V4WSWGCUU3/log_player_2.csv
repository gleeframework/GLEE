"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I need to push for a much lower price.  I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my price range, $14,000 is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject her offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too far off for me. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can't go above $12,000. Let's see if we can bridge that gap."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to chip away at the price, aiming for a deal that's closer to my budget. I've offered $12,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but hopefully it's a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $13,500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still outside my budget. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still determined to get a better deal. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating in the next round, hoping to get a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still at my limit with $12,000.  If we can't agree on that, I'll need to explore other options.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $12,000.  I've made it clear that this is my final offer, and if Alice doesn't accept, I'll be forced to consider buying from John. This is a strategic move to put pressure on Alice and incentivize her to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're at your limit, but I'm not willing to sell at $12,000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer with a price of $13,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm confident it's the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,000 is still above my budget.  While I'm close to making a deal, I'm unwilling to go over my limit.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000."
