"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too far off for me. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can't go above $12,000. Let's see if we can bridge that gap.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $13,500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still at my limit with $12,000.  If we can't agree on that, I'll need to explore other options.  This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're at your limit, but I'm not willing to sell at $12,000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer with a price of $13,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm confident it's the best we can do.",13000.0,Alice,7,
