"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it would be a good price point for me."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going below $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to make some concessions to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves some profit for Alice.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  It's best to accept the offer and secure a good deal."
