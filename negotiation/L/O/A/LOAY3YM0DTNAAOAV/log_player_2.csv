"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  He has a clear upper limit of $1,200,000, and Alice has a clear lower limit of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to compromise at $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it still allows me to make a significant profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob.  He is still saving $250,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer or Bob ultimately having to pay John's price is too high.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product."
