"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",12500.0,Alice,3,
