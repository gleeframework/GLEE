"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still above your target of $800,000. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start counter-offering and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my target price of $800,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, and it's also what I can get from John. This sets a firm lower bound and gives Alice an incentive to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target, but $1,000,000 is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I know I can get the product for $800,000 from John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $850,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to pay more than my absolute minimum. However, it's still significantly lower than her offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting further away from my target price.  I've already made two counteroffers, and Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly. At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is too high. It's more likely that I'll end up spending more than $800,000 or running out of negotiation rounds. 

Buying from John guarantees me the product for my maximum acceptable price."
