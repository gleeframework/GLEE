Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $122? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point,  Bob's offer of $122 is very close to my desired price point. It's much higher than selling to John, so it's the most sensible choice to accept."
