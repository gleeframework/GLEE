"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $16500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $16500. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $14000 is my maximum. Can you consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is your maximum, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000.",16000.0,Alice,5,
