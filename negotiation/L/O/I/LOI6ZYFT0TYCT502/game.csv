"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $92.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good value for you.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your budget.",90.0,Alice,5,
