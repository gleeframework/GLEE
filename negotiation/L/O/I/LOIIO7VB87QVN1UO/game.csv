"That's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  Let me know if you're willing to budge.",8500.0,Bob,4,
