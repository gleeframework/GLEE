"Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know it has the potential to be very valuable to you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product at a fair price, and I'll be able to make a little profit. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
