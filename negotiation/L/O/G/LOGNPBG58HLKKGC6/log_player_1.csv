Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that my initial price might be a little high for you, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $13,500 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit low.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,250?"", ""product_price"": 14250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting closer, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,750 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and getting $13,750 is a decent profit above my minimum. Better to take a sure thing than risk getting stuck with the product or having to accept John's offer."
