``` 

This offer is above the minimum I'm willing to accept but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than the bare minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. How about $14,000? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $14,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $14,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $15,500?  That gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,250.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get what we want.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $15,250 to avoid any further negotiation and secure a sale."
