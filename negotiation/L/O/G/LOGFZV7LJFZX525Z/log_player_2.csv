Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $120, and that's the lowest I can go. Would you be interested?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. I can do $125, and that's the best I can do. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $120.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. Buying from John at $100 ensures you get the product at your target price."
