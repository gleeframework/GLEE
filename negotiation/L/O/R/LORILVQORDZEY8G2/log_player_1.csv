"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. I'm willing to offer you $900,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  I believe I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show you my commitment to making this deal work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation with Bob in hopes of reaching a higher price.  The value of the product to me is still significantly higher than his current offer, and I'm confident we can find common ground."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still too far from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
