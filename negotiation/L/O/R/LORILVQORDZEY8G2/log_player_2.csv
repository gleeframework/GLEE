"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. I'm willing to offer you $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show you my commitment to making this deal work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He's still better off buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still too far from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still over his budget, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation. Buying from John for $800,000 ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
