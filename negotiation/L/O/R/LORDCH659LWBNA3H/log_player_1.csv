Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I believe it's a great deal and you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below your minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, even if it's just a few dollars. Any amount above $120 is pure profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John guarantees you won't be forced to go below your minimum price."
