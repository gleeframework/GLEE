Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate. Bob is clearly interested, and we can use that to our advantage in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm getting close to my limit, so I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now getting into the later rounds, but Bob's offer is still significantly higher than our guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. Bob stating he's ""getting close to his limit"" could be a negotiating tactic, but it also suggests we're approaching a critical point.  Let's push a little further but be ready to concede more ground in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both striving for a fair deal.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,437,500. This is a substantial move, reflecting my commitment to finalizing this agreement."",
""product_price"": 1437500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're splitting the difference again in this round, showing Bob we're serious about closing the deal but not willing to concede too much ground too quickly.  This price point keeps us comfortably above John's offer while still potentially appealing to Bob. We'll need to be prepared to make a more significant move if Bob rejects this offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my target, but I still think we can meet a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob's offer is still $300,000 above our guaranteed sale to John. It's getting late in the negotiation, and there's always the risk Bob walks away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit."
