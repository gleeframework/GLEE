"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth more than that to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than its worth to her, it's still more than your maximum price of $8,000. 
* You know John will sell you the same product for $8,000. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product from John and save $2,000."
