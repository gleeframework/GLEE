Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget.
