"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $7,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since she's already offering a discount. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $6,500. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
