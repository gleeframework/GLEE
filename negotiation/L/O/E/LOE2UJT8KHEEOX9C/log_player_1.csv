Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but it also reflects the value I place on the product.  I want to maximize my profit, but I'm also willing to negotiate to reach a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000 as my counteroffer. It's a compromise, but still higher than Bob's offer. I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product has a value closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still lower than what John is offering. I'm going to sell to John for $10,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value. It's not the highest I could potentially get, but it's a guaranteed sale and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob."
