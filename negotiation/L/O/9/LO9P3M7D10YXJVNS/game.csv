"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price is fair, considering your value for the product, and it's within my budget.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering your own valuation and my budget.  I hope you'll consider it.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending right now.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,012,500. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. It's a significant step closer to my previous offer, and I'm hopeful you'll find it acceptable.",1012500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $1,012,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,015,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to go up to $1,013,750. This is a slight increase from my last offer, and it's practically a hair's breadth from your previous offer.  It feels like we're both very close to finding a price that works for us. I'm hoping you'll agree to this and we can close the deal.",1013750.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $1,013,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,012,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1012000.0,Alice,9,
