,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1300000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to negotiate.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1150000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about $1225000? I'm trying to be flexible here, and this price is still fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's make a deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute top limit. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's very close to your value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
