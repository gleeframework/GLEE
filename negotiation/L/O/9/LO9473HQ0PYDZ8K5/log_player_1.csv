Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price than $120. I'll see what Bob's next offer is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Bob. $125 is closer to my desired price, and I'm still within the early rounds.  I'll see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $130. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my minimum price of $100, and we're already in round 6.  It's not ideal, but I'm going to take the deal and avoid the risk of losing out on a sale to John or a complete breakdown of the negotiations."
