Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum while leaving room for negotiation. I believe this will be attractive to Bob while also allowing me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $175.  This is a compromise that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial price, this is a good deal that still allows me to earn more than my minimum.  It's also a compromise that shows good negotiation skills. Selling to John at this point would only give me my minimum, and there's no guarantee I could get a better price in a future round."
