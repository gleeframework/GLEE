"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm looking to spend no more than $120 on this product.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about $135?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $127.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $127.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both close to agreeing.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.  How about we meet in the middle at $128.75?  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.",128.75,Bob,6,
