Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm going to start with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows some room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still higher than what Bob offered but is closer to my minimum price. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to what the product is worth to him, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have more rounds to try and reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping that Bob will accept it. However, if he doesn't, I still have the option of selling the product to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his price.  I've already reached my minimum, and there's no guarantee he'll come up further. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
