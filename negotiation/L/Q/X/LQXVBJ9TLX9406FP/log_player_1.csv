I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but hopefully still attractive to Bob.  We'll see how he responds and adjust from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$9,000 is far too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is my minimum value for the product. This should be a fair compromise, and hopefully Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, which is my minimum price and a guaranteed sale."
