I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept but still within the range of what the product is worth to him.  I'm confident that we can negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still need to make sure I get a reasonable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is now significantly below the value I place on the product.  It's not worth continuing to haggle. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is a fair price that guarantees I get what the product is worth to me."
