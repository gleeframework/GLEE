"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $13,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a little more than I had in mind. How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $12,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting down to the wire for me.  $12,250 is still a bit too high for my budget.  My final offer is $11,500.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to go with John.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to making a decision, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $12,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,750. This is my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,7,
