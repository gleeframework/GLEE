You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John offers. You can save a substantial amount of money ($400,000) by going with John."
