Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would still be a profitable deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you value it at. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
