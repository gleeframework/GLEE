"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I believe Bob will likely be willing to pay a bit more than $80 for the product since it's worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that Bob will be willing to accept, as it's still significantly less than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $85 is still a better deal than selling to John for $80.  It's also important to remember that we only have 10 rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
