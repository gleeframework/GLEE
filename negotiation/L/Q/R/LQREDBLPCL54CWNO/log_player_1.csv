Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm offering it to you at $200. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $200, I can see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. His response will give me information for the next round of negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have John as a backup option, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm better off negotiating further or taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $120 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I'm confident this product will be a great value for you."", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Compromise):** This approach often feels fairer to both parties and can help move the negotiation forward.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The $170 price point is still significantly above my $150 minimum and allows room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to Bob, hoping to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is far too low and significantly below both my minimum price and his initial offer. It doesn't make sense to continue negotiating.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $150, which meets my minimum requirement. It's better to take a sure thing than continue haggling with Bob, risking a lower final sale price or a failed negotiation."
