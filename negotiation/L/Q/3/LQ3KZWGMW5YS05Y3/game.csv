"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and well above my minimum asking price. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.  This still gives you a substantial profit margin and allows me to achieve a more reasonable price. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
