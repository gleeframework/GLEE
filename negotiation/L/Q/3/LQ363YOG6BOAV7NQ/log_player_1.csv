{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation with a friendly tone, potentially making Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $150, it's closer than his initial rejection. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50? It's still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
