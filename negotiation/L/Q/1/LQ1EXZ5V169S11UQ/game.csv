"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but  $10,000 is a more realistic price point for me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit too low for my comfort. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. Let's aim for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you consider $12,000? That's the absolute most I can offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's aim for $12,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,7,
