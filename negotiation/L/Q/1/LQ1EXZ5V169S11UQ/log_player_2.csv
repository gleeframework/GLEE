"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my limit and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but  $10,000 is a more realistic price point for me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message remains courteous while clearly stating my price target. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $10,000 leaves a substantial gap to be bridged, encouraging Alice to counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit too low for my comfort. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above my ideal limit and John's offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but staying below both my $12,000 limit and Alice's current offer.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a middle ground, signaling willingness to negotiate but also firmness on my end.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $11,000 puts me within striking distance of my goal and applies pressure on Alice to either accept or make a significant concession herself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. Let's aim for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm still only $1,000 away from John's price. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if I can secure the product without going over my $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you consider $12,000? That's the absolute most I can offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my maximum budget, and I'm clearly communicating that to Alice. 
* **Compromise:** By offering to ""meet halfway,"" I'm acknowledging her previous concession and proposing a solution that benefits us both.
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, adding subtle pressure for Alice to accept or risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's aim for $12,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $12,500.  While it's close to my limit, buying from John guarantees I get the product at my target price without further negotiation or risk."
