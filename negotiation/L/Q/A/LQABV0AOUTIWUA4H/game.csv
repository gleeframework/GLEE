"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. It's still a good profit for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's well under your estimated value. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
