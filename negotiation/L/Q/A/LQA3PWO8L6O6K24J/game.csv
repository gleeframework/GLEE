,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider buying it for around $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $120 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $95? That would work for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",110.0,Alice,5,
