"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000 for the product.  It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget better.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9500? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a reasonable compromise, as it splits the difference between Bob's offer of $9,000 and Alice's previous offer of $10,000. 
* **Meeting Bob's budget:**  $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Accepting Alice's offer avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a stalemate, potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
