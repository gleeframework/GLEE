Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. However, I'm open to discussing this further and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows her product's value to her ($12,000) and Bob ($10,000). She starts with a price higher than both ($14,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This high initial offer helps Alice understand how motivated Bob is to buy. If he's willing to negotiate down from $14,000, she might secure a price closer to $13,000 or $12,000.
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has a safety net with John, who guarantees her $12,000. This gives her leverage in negotiations with Bob.
* **Open Communication:** The message invites Bob to discuss the price, fostering a sense of collaboration and increasing the chance of a successful deal. 

**Strategy:**

Alice's strategy is to aim high but be flexible. She wants to maximize her profit, but she also wants to avoid a stalemate with Bob, as a quick sale is preferable to waiting for John."
