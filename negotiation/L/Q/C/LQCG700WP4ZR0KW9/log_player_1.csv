Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,500.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,500 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns."", ""product_price"": 11250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I can see you're invested in finding a fair deal. To be honest, $10,000 is the very top of my budget.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $10,000 is his absolute limit.  While we're close, it's unlikely he'll go any higher. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially falling through."
