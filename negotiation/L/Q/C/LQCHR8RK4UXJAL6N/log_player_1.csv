{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially reach a price above his value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing fairness to create a positive initial impression. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my next offer accordingly.
* If the negotiation drags on or stalls, I'll be ready to move on to John and sell for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for better price:**  There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, so there's no pressure to accept Bob's offer just because it's the first one.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but still allows for some negotiation space. This will depend on how confident I am in securing a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,000,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob by mentioning that it's still a ""great deal"" for him.
* **Progress towards a deal:**  I'm showing that I'm serious about reaching an agreement by suggesting a price that's closer to his offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely watch Bob's response. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate the situation and potentially make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $1,000,000 is a great deal for me, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle yet. 
* **John's offer is still my safety net:** I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, so I can afford to be patient and continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price that's a little closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than $950,000. I'll aim for something like $1,050,000 or $1,025,000. 
* I'll reiterate the value proposition to Bob and emphasize that we are getting closer to a mutually beneficial deal. 
* If the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffers become unacceptable, I'll be ready to switch to John and secure my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you almost halfway, though.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it demonstrates how committed I am to reaching an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** This counteroffer is a small concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" for both parties to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and compromise.
* **Strong commitment:** I'm reiterating my commitment to reaching an agreement to increase the chances of Bob accepting.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!  I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully assess the situation. I might make another counteroffer, but if the negotiation seems to be going nowhere, I'll switch to John and secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to a deal, but not enough:** While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000.  It's not a substantial enough increase to justify continuing the negotiation.
* **Bob's final offer:**  Bob has declared this his final offer, indicating that he is unlikely to budge further.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John that meets my minimum requirements. There's no point in risking a lower price with Bob when I have a better option.

**Next Steps:**

* I will politely decline Bob's final offer and proceed to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum desired price and avoid potentially settling for less with Bob."
