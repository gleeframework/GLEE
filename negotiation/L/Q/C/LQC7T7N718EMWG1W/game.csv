"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see $950000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still not at my ideal price, but I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to compromise at $925000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
