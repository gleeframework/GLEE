Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $12,000. Aiming for a price slightly below that ($11,500) maximizes potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a fair deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net.  This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the product's value."
