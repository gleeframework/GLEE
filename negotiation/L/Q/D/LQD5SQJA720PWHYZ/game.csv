"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my original asking price, Bob.
