Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or a potentially higher profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $15 markup is a reasonable starting point. It's not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away, but it still allows for a decent profit margin. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product is worth at least $120, you anchor the value in Bob's mind and make the $135 price seem more palatable."
