"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $7500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8200. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I think $8400 is the lowest I can go. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",8400.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $8400 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $8000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,6,
