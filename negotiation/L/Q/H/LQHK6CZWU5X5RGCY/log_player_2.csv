Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to a decision. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,800 and $7,400.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and meet in the middle.  While we might be able to get the price a little lower, it's getting close to the point where it might not be worth the risk of her pulling out of the deal.  $7,600 is a good price and saves a significant amount from both John's offer and Alice's initial offer."
