Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept $10,125. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to stick to it.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is holding firm:** Alice has returned to her previous offer of $10,500 and signaled this is her final compromise. 
* **Limited time:** With only a few rounds left, there's a risk Alice won't budge further, and we'll end up paying John's price of $15,000.
* **Significant savings:** $10,500 is a good deal compared to John's price and saves us $4,500.

While we could try to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's becoming increasingly unlikely, and the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a few hundred dollars more in savings."
