"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is getting closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,750. Would that be possible?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to the price you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll only go up to $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a final compromise.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. It seems we're getting close.  How about we settle at $10,125? That's a fair split of the difference between our last two offers.",10125.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept $10,125. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to stick to it.",10500.0,Alice,7,
