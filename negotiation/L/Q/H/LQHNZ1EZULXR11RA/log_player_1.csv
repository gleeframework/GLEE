"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm going to gauge his interest with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a decent profit. It's a good middle ground that might get Bob to accept."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,500. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm still hoping to close a deal with Bob, and I'm confident I can push for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm making another counteroffer, this time at $11,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still determined to get a price that's closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping this offer will finally convince Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging, and the price is getting too low for me.  I'm going to sell the product to John. I'm not willing to risk going any lower with Bob, and at least John is offering my minimum."
