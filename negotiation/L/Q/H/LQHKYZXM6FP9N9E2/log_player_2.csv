"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $900,000 is above his budget, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within a reasonable range. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives Bob room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John is always an option, but Bob should try to squeeze more savings from Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob is now offering Alice's maximum price. This puts the ball in Alice's court.  If Alice rejects, Bob can go to John and get the product for the same price. This is a strategic move to see if Alice is willing to accept his final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to ""BuyFromJhon"". He has already made his final offer and Alice has rejected it. Continuing the negotiation with Alice risks going back and forth for several more rounds, potentially ending with no deal. Buying from John is the best option now as he can secure the product for his maximum budget and avoid further negotiation."
