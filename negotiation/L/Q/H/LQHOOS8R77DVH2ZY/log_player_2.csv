"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $130. This is significantly more than your maximum budget. It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price, $100. This is a strong opening counteroffer, and it signals to Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but not willing to pay more than it's worth to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. While $115 is closer to my limit, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have multiple rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $105. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still firmly within my budget. It also gives me some wiggle room for future negotiations if needed."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not ready to commit. I've already shown Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, and I have more rounds to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $108. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to get closer to her price point. However, it's still below her current offer of $112, giving me room to negotiate further. It's a strategic move to keep the negotiations moving forward and hopefully secure a deal within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is tempting, I'm still not ready to commit. I have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price.  I'm within a few dollars of my limit and would like to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $109. This shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway, while still staying within my budget. Since we only have a few rounds left, this could be a good compromise to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last round. Alice's offer of $111 is still outside my comfort zone, and I'm not sure if I can negotiate a lower price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $100, ensuring that I stay within my budget and get the product."
