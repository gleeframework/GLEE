"I appreciate your product, but I'm not sure it's worth $13000. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it, which is the most I'm willing to pay. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $12500 for this product.  This is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it offers, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $11500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $12000 to finalize this deal.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed.  Let me know if you're ready to accept!",12000.0,Alice,5,
