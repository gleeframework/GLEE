"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand your perspective, I would like to propose an alternative. Could we agree on a price of $10500 for the product? This would still allow me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value you place on it.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $11250. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
