Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  $95 is still too high for me. I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
