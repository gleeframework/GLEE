Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price close to my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation if Bob rejects it. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob, so he might be willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $130 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $130 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  How about $135? I believe this is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $135. My maximum budget remains $130. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has made his final offer, and it's clear that he won't go higher. While I'd prefer a higher price, $130 is better than selling to John for $100. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and ensures I don't lose out on potential profit."
