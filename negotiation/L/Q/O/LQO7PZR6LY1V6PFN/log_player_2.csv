"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He has 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $8,500?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to strike a balance between saving money and making a reasonable offer.  He's proposing a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's perceived value of the product. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to work with you.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit in price, but Bob is still looking to save more money.  He has multiple rounds left and can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still really interested in the product, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. That's a good price for both of us and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing Alice that he is serious about the product and is willing to meet her halfway. He has increased his offer from the previous round, but is still significantly lower than Alice's current price. This is a good strategy for continuing the negotiation and getting a better price for himself."
