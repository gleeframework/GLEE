"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, leaving room for negotiation but still above my minimum. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value and quality of the product to encourage Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to engage with the offer and start the negotiation process. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going below my minimum. I'll be prepared to make counteroffers in subsequent rounds if needed.  However, if Bob proves difficult or I feel like the negotiation is stalling, I have the backup option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $8,500?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $8,000. While I'm not happy with his price, I recognize that he's showing interest. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to engage in further rounds to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm hoping to get a better price through negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my ideal price. I'll use this round to gauge Bob's flexibility and see if he's willing to budge from his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to work with you.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer from $8,000 to $9,250, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a firm stance.
* **Value Focus:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll receive, hoping to incentivize him to meet me halfway.
* **Negotiation Signal:**  This counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm prepared to continue negotiating while ensuring I don't drop below my minimum.

**Strategy:**

This round is crucial to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy, considering if a sale to John is the best option or if I should continue to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still really interested in the product, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. That's a good price for both of us and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Although I would prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in Round 4, and I need to make a decision quickly.

**Strategy:**

This is a good deal considering the time constraint and the risk of Bob walking away or me being forced to sell to John.  I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
