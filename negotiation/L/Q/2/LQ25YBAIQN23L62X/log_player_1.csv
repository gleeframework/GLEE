Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's generally wise to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $120, offering it at $115 leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a slight discount while still maximizing your potential profit.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John's offer of $100 in mind gives you a fallback option and a price floor below which you wouldn't sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his own valuation of the product ($120). This suggests there's still room for negotiation. You're better off rejecting this low offer and proposing a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob halfway between his initial offer ($90) and your initial asking price ($115). This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can facilitate a quicker agreement.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The $105 price point ensures you still make a profit above your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While you're willing to negotiate, you're demonstrating that you're not desperate to sell below a reasonable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $98 is still below your ideal price, it's now very close to your fallback option of selling to John for $100.  

* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or further lowering his offer. Accepting $98 guarantees a profit above your minimum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Reaching a deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations. The faster you sell, the faster you can re-invest or use the funds. 
* **Marginal Difference:** The difference between $98 and $100 is relatively small in the context of the overall deal."
