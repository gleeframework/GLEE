"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $15,500. This is a great price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you, so I think it's fair.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $15,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
