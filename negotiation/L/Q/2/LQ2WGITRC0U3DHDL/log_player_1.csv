Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, while still securing a significant profit above his perceived value.
* **Create Urgency:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value,"" I aim to encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high sale price and increasing the likelihood of closing the deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
