"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,750,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay  $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate but I need a higher price to make this worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not feasible. Let's try $1,200,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget. I can do $700,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate him coming up to $700,000, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need a more substantial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $1,000,000? This price still allows you a significant profit margin considering the value of the product for you. Let's find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe that's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $750,000 is still a long way from what this product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
