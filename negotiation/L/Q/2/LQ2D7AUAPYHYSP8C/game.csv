"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,750,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay  $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not feasible. Let's try $1,200,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget. I can do $700,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $1,000,000? This price still allows you a significant profit margin considering the value of the product for you. Let's find some common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $750,000 is still a long way from what this product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
