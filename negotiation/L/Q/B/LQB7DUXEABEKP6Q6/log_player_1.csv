I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter offer him a higher price. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept given his threat to walk away, I'm still a bit far from my desired price point. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more."
