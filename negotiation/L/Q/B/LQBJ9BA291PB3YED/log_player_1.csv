"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's estimated value, but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the potential return on his investment.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a question to initiate dialogue and show flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $1,250,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **I still have 9 rounds left.**  There's time to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** However, I want to exhaust negotiation possibilities with Bob first, as I might be able to secure a higher price than John's offer."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to show my commitment to reaching an agreement. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I reject Bob's offer while remaining open to negotiation.  I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my bottom line.

```

**Explanation:**

* **I have 6 rounds left.** There's still time to potentially secure a higher price from Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,450,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value this product brings to your business.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Getting Closer:** I acknowledge Bob's effort but reiterate my need for a higher price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 finally meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 6, and I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation.
* **No Guarantee with John:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, I've invested time and effort in negotiating with Bob. 

It's a win-win situation: Bob gets the product at his desired price, and I achieve my minimum goal."
