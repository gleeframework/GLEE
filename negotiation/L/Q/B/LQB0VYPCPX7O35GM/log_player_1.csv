"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for cheap.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob still has a significant profit margin, making him likely to engage.
* **It's a strong opening bid:**  You show confidence in your product's value. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below what the product is worth to Bob.  We're aiming for a higher profit, and it's worth pushing for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's lower than your initial offer:** Shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer:**  You're not giving away the value. 
* **It leaves room for a final agreement:**  Both parties have some wiggle room to work with. 

Let's see if Bob accepts or counters again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a bit higher, we're still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  We're in the middle of the negotiation, so it's worth seeing if we can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This is a strategic counteroffer:

* **It's lower than your previous offer:**  Shows continued willingness to negotiate.
* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  You're not conceding too much.
* **It's closer to the middle ground:**  This might incentivize Bob to close the deal.

Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement!"
