"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price. There's a significant difference between $1,200,000 and Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000, making it worth exploring a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This represents a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  The counteroffer is also significantly lower than Bob's maximum price, leaving him with a comfortable margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's target.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and attempt to get a better price. There's still potential to bring the price down further, as Bob's maximum price is significantly higher than Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying within his desired price range.  $950,000 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway while still securing a good deal.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground that both parties can accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob still has some room to negotiate, Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to his desired price.  At this point, accepting the offer is a strategic move.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away and leaving Bob with no option but to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price, leaving Bob with a good deal."
