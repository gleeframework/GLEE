"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $125? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. How about $115? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $115 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $110? I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $110 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference one last time and go with $115? This is a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $112? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",112.0,Bob,8,
