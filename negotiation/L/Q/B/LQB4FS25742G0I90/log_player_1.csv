Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he might be willing to pay a little more.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to accept $15,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a strong first offer:**  It shows you're confident in the value of your product and are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not desperate to sell and have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer. I want to see if I can bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $12,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
