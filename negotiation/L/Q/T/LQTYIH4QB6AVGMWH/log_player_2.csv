"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, I can potentially get it for even cheaper by negotiating.  I have 10 rounds, so I have room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if necessary. It's a good starting point to see how Alice reacts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'll counter again.  $85 is still too high for my target of $120, and I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum price point of $120. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to overpay."
