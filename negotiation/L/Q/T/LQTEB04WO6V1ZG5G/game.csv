"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so I'll offer $92.50 for the product.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've already given you a great price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $97.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to pay $92, and I think that's a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from there.",92.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already given you a significant discount. I'm not willing to go any lower than $95, and I think that's the lowest I can go. I'm willing to stick with my previous offer of $97.50, but I'm not budging below $95. It's a fair price for a product that's worth $120 to you.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to pay $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $92, which is the price I offered earlier. I'll offer $92.50, and I think that's a fair price for the product.",92.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer that's closer to your price. I'll meet you at $93, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'll sell it to you for $93. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",93.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $93. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $92, which is the price I offered earlier. I'll offer $92.50, and I think that's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $120.",92.5,Bob,10,
