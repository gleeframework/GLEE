"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I understand that we're both trying to find a suitable price. While $700,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,000,000 even?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  My final offer is $750,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.",750000.0,Bob,6,
