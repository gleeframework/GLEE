Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $800,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to sell the product for $800,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her product's actual value to her.  This is a strong signal that she won't go any lower. It's a good deal for Bob, well below his maximum budget, and further haggling risks losing the deal."
