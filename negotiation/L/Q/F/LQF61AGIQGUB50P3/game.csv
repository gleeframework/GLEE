"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure if $10500 is within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000.

"I'm still not convinced that $11000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I think the product has to me.",10500.0,Bob,6,
