Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

This strategy starts high to give you room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 for it.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. We have significant room to negotiate upwards before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

We're coming down in price, but still staying well above both Bob's offer and our minimum. The message aims to convey firmness while still showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a substantial increase from my initial offer and reflects a genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we can still try to push for a better price before settling for John's offer.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To be fair, I can't accept anything less than $1,200,000. This is my final offer - it represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** We're now very close to both Bob's highest perceived value and our minimum. This offer creates a firm anchor at our absolute lowest price. 
* **Time pressure:** By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative:**  It's important for Bob to know we have a viable alternative with John, even though we don't explicitly mention it. 

This strategy aims to either secure a deal at our minimum acceptable price or prompt Bob to reveal if he's truly willing to meet that price."
