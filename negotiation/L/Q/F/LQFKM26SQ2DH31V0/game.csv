"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 for it.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a substantial increase from my initial offer and reflects a genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To be fair, I can't accept anything less than $1,200,000. This is my final offer - it represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
