"Bob, I understand your position. $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This allows both of us to gain something from the deal. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,325,000? This would be a good starting point for a final agreement.  What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to meet my goals.  Let's seal this deal.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
