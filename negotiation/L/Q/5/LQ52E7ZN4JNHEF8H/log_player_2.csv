Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and bring significant value to your organization. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  While I'm interested, I'm not sure I can justify $800,000 at this time.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue exploring a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $725,000?  This price would allow me to move forward with the purchase while still being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still not comfortable going below $750000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $735000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $735,000, which is very close to your last counteroffer of $725,000. It's likely that further negotiations will only yield a small price decrease, and there is a risk that Alice will walk away.  Accepting the offer at this point secures the product at a good price within your budget."
