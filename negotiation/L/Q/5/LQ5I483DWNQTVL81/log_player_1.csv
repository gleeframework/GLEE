Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is capped at $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering your initial offer was $15,000, which is closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
