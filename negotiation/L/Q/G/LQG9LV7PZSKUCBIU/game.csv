"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While $1500000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? This allows for a fair return for me and still offers you a significant price advantage.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
