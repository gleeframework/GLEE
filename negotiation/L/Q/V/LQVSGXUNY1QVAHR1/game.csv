"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $85.  Could you meet me halfway at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $105 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference between your offer and my last price? Would you be willing to pay $95?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $95 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John at $80 otherwise.",90.0,Bob,6,
