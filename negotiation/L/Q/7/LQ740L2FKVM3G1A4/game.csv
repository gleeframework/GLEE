"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the unique value you mentioned, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm confident that's still a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy with the deal.  Let's try to make this happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not ready to accept $12500. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's worth. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
