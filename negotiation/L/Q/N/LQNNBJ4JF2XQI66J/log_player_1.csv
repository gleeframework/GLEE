Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,900,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product to you, but given my financial situation, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,550,000. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I am also considering purchasing the product from another seller at a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Bob is signaling he won't go higher and is prepared to walk. While I could counter, John's guaranteed $1,500,000 is better than risking Bob going with the other seller.  It's time to secure the sure thing."
