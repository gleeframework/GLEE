"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,900,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Would you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product to you, but given my financial situation, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,550,000. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I am also considering purchasing the product from another seller at a lower price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
