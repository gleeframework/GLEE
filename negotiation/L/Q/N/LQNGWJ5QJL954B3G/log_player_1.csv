"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,400,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a significant amount of money.  However, it's still less than the product is worth to Bob, so there's a good chance he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, it will be enough to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,300,000 is still a good deal, we're in the later rounds now, and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,325,000. I'm trying to find the sweet spot where Bob is likely to accept, but I can still earn a good amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm worried that Bob will get frustrated and walk away. Accepting his offer of $1,300,000 is still a good deal, and it ensures I get a sale."
