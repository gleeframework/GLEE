"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget at the moment. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the market and the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a significant step from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  I hope you'll find this fair and we can finally reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I believe the product's value is worth every penny, and I'm not ready to give up on that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $810,000.  This is a significant commitment on my part, and I hope you'll see it as a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",810000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to sell the product for $810,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer the product to you for $820,000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make, and I hope you'll consider it.",820000.0,Alice,7,
