,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While the product sounds interesting, $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8200 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $9000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $8700 for the product. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $8700. How about we split the difference and I pay $8600?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8600.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8700 and $8600. I can do $8650 for the product. It's my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. What do you think?",8650.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $8650 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8600. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's make it happen.",8600.0,Bob,8,
