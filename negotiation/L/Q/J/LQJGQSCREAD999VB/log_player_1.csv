{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

This offer allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a higher price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, however, and offer the product for $13,250.  This would still allow for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $12,750. This is the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to hold out for a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's clear he's unlikely to go higher. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoids risking a potential deal falling through."
