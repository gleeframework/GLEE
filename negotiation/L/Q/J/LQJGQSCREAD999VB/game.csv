"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, however, and offer the product for $13,250.  This would still allow for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $12,750. This is the highest I can go. What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,4,
