"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500? I think that's a fair price.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $7,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,750 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",7200.0,Alice,5,
