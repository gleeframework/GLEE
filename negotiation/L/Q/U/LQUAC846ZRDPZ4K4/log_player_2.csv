"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this great product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $140 is far above your $80 limit. You can get a better deal from John for $80."
