"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $110. That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make a deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $105 is still too low. Let's split the difference - $107.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",107.5,Alice,5,
