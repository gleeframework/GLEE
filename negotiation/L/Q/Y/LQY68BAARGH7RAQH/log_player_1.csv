Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a price within a range both of us can agree on.
* **It's below your minimum:** This incentivizes Bob to accept the offer rather than immediately rejecting it.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can adjust your price down to find a mutually agreeable number.

Remember, you can always stop the negotiation and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low,  $7,500 is significantly less than what the product is worth to me ($12,000).  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  It demonstrates that I'm flexible and open to finding a solution.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** It's still above Bob's offer, allowing for potential compromise. 
* **Keeps me closer to my desired price:** $9,000 is significantly closer to my $12,000 minimum than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $8,250 is still lower than my ideal price, it's very close to Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  This means there's a good chance he won't go any higher, and I risk losing out on a sale.  Therefore, it's best to accept this offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of him walking away entirely."
