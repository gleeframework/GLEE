Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While aiming high, there's a chance Bob might negotiate. Offering $1,100,000 leaves space for a potential counter-offer while staying well above your minimum.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
