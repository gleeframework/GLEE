I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. It also signals to Bob that I value the product highly and am not desperate to sell."

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's still a good price for me, but I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise to reach an agreement."
