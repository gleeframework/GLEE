"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $115 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and reflects the true worth of the product. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $120 and John offers the product for that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you set the stage for a potential counter-offer closer to your target price."
