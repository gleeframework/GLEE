"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $16,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $16,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($10,000) and John's offer ($10,000). It's highly unlikely Alice will come down to a price you're willing to accept immediately. It makes much more sense to negotiate or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within a reasonable price range. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. While it might seem aggressive, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  Offering $8,000 leaves ample space to potentially meet in the middle somewhere closer to your $10,000 limit. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will quickly reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she completely rejects it, you'll know you might be better off going with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $16,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $14,000 is still significantly higher than your $10,000 limit and John's offer. It's clear Alice is willing to negotiate, so there's room to potentially bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for moving on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Your Limit:** By countering with your maximum budget, you're subtly informing Alice of your limit without revealing your hand entirely. 
* **Encouraging a Realistic Offer:**  This offer encourages Alice to propose a price closer to your range if she's genuinely interested in selling. 
* **Preparing for John:**  If Alice rejects this offer, it strongly indicates she won't settle within your budget, making John your best option."
