"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and would allow me to get a reasonable price for my product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,080,000 is unfortunately too low for me.
