"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $175. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my final offer.",150.0,Bob,4,
