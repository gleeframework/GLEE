"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's lower than my minimum but still leaves me some room to negotiate.  This hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating to try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $125? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 
I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrating the value of the product. This could potentially lead to a quick agreement or further negotiation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your last offer. I'd like to propose $122 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $122 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to continue negotiating, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to accept a lower price or sell to John.  I need to see if I can get Bob any higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $122 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $123? This seems like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 123}
```

I'm continuing to negotiate, but I'm also starting to make smaller increments in my counteroffers. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but also that I'm not willing to give away the product for much less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I'd like to counter with $122.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting very close to my minimum, but Bob's offer is still below it. With only 4 rounds left, I'm worried I might not be able to get a higher price.  To ensure I at least meet my minimum, I'm going to sell to John."
