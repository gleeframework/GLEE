Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. This information is crucial for setting a strategic price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to earn as much as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim for a higher price with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can then consider a counteroffer closer to $15,000. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** A price slightly below a round number like $20,000 might make it seem more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy gives you the best shot at maximizing your potential profit. If Bob rejects it, you still have John as a reliable backup."
