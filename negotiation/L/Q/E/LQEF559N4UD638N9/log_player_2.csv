"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
