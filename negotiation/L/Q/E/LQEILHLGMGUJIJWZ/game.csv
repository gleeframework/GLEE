"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is very interesting, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it shows my serious interest in purchasing this product. Let's get this deal done.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $885,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
