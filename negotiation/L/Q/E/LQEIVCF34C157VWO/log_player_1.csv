Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to settle. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $14,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for profit while being closer to Bob's proposed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer further.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price, so I'll take that option."
