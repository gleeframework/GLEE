Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I can afford to start higher. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value without explicitly stating my bottom line. This keeps the negotiation power in my hands. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the $10,000 offer, I can lower the price slightly or accept his counter-offer. Worst case, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000."
