Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair deal to me.

While Bob's offer matches John's, further negotiation with Bob might not yield a better outcome. It's better to take a sure thing than risk losing both offers."
