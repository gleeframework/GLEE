"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair deal to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
