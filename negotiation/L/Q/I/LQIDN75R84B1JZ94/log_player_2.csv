# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product, which holds immense value to both of us. Our product, a masterpiece of innovation and craftsmanship, is worth $1,500,000 to you, and it has been designed to exceed your expectations in every way possible. I am extending this exclusive offer to you at a special price of $1,200,000, aiming to create a mutually beneficial transaction that respects the true worth of the product while ensuring you receive exceptional value. This offer is valid for a limited time only, so please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. Thank you for considering this remarkable opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget, her message tries to inflate the product's value to you.  You know you can get it for $1,500,000 from John. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's actual valuation of $800,000."
