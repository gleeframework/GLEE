"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $11,000 at this time. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. I hope this is within your acceptable range.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and I appreciate the value of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $10,200. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're willing to accept.",10200.0,Bob,4,
