"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $9,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $9,500.  You are willing to pay up to $10,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You are still willing to pay more than Alice's offer, and you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering will allow you to potentially save more money."
