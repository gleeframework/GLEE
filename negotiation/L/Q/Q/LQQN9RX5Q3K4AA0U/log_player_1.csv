Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This allows room for negotiation without risking selling below your minimum.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It shows you're willing to be flexible while still aiming for a good price.

Remember, if Bob rejects this offer, you can always adjust your price or make a counteroffer based on his response. You also have the option to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John for $15,000 at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $10,000, you can likely get closer to your target price by continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It's a compromise:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but still holding firm to your desired price point.
* **It's close to your minimum:**  $12,000 is closer to your minimum of $15,000 than Bob's offer, which gives you a better chance of reaching an agreement that benefits you.
* **It provides a reason:**  Mentioning ""fair price"" and ""good value"" can help persuade Bob to accept.

Remember, you can always go back to John if Bob doesn't accept your counteroffer."
