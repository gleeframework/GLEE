Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping he sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a good price for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see that my product is worth more than $120 and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below what I would ideally like to get, but it's above my minimum value of $150.  Since I'm unsure if I'll be able to get a better price in another round and John is offering a fixed price of $150, it's best to accept Bob's offer."
