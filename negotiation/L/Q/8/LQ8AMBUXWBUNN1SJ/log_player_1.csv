"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $8,000. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $8,500. This would allow me to fairly compensate for the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm proposing a price halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it. I've managed to get my desired price without having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
