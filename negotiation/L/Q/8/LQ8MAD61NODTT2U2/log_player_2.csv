"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price, it's always worth trying to negotiate for a lower price. There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and even if not, you'll gain more information about her willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer (20% less) to show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating. This gives us room to bargain without immediately hitting a stalemate.
* **Value justification:** I mention the product's value *to me* to emphasize that my offer is based on my own assessment and not just a random number.
* **Open-ended question:**  ""Let me know what you think"" leaves the ball in Alice's court, encouraging her to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved significantly from her initial position, and her offer is now very close to my desired price.  While there's a slight chance I could get her to go lower, the risk of losing the deal or wasting valuable negotiation rounds is not worth it.  Accepting at this point secures a good deal and saves time."
