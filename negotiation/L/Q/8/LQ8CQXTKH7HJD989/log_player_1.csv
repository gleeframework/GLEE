I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize potential profit. I'm also confident in the value of my product, so I'm willing to stand my ground for a while. However, if Bob rejects my initial offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further.  I'll be paying attention to Bob's counteroffers to gauge his interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for a good profit margin. I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see that and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's still a good deal for me, especially compared to selling to John for $1,000,000. It's likely we won't get much closer than this, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
