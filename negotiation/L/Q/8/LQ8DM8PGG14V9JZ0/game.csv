"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is below my minimum price, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while also giving you a good value.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to my original budget. Would you consider $9,500?  This would be a great price for me and help me move forward with this purchase.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too far from my minimum.  How about we meet at $10,000?  This is a good compromise that gives you a great value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
