{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  By offering $12,000, I have a good chance of reaching a compromise that benefits both of us.  
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** If Bob counteroffers, I'll use his offer as a guide to adjust my own counteroffer. I'll also consider how much time is left and how important it is to close the deal. 
* **Plan B (John):** If negotiations with Bob stall or go below my minimum acceptable price, I have John as a backup buyer at my target price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price if I counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer Provides Leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm and push for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my target price but still acknowledges his budget constraints. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'll emphasize the value of the product to Bob and highlight the benefits he will gain by acquiring it. 
* **Time Management:** I'll be mindful of the time and be prepared to sell to John if negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming or unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is below my minimum price, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while also giving you a good value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate my belief that the product is valuable to Bob and that $10,500 represents a fair deal for both of us. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer. 
* **Flexible Approach:** If Bob counters again, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and the remaining time available.
* **Decision Point:** I'll stay focused on my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and be prepared to switch to John if negotiations become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to my original budget. Would you consider $9,500?  This would be a great price for me and help me move forward with this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer, it's not enough to make me seriously consider selling to Bob.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm not ready to walk away from the deal yet. There's still potential for us to reach an agreement.
* **John's Offer Provides Confidence:**  Knowing John is waiting in the wings at $15,000 allows me to be patient and push for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target but still acknowledging his budget. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'll continue to highlight the value of the product and how it benefits Bob.
* **Time Management:** I'll be mindful of the time and be prepared to sell to John if negotiations stall or become unproductive."
