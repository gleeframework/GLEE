"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider it?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $105? I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I still need to make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Can you consider it?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to continuing the conversation but $95 isn't quite working for me.  How about $100? That's my absolute minimum, and it ensures we both get a fair deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
