"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value this product holds. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the potential value of this product, I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that works for both of us. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both parties.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
