"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm aware of its worth to you, and I'm prepared to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking $1,000,000.  This is a firm price, but I'm confident it represents a significant opportunity for you.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
