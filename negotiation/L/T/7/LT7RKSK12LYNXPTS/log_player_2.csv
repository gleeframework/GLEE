"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to get the product for less than $150. Alice's offer is higher than your target. It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130. This is still above Alice's value of $120, giving her some room to negotiate, but it's also significantly lower than her initial offer. It's a good starting point to see if she's willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget of $150 and is a better deal than buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer, forcing me to either buy from John at a higher price or risk losing the product entirely. Accepting her offer guarantees I get the product at a reasonable price."
