Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm offering the product for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount for Bob but still leaves me with a profit of $200,000. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate.  

Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This offer is a starting point and allows for further negotiation. 
* **Fair for both parties:** It provides a significant benefit to Bob while still giving you a good profit.
* **Avoids immediate rejection:**  This offer is likely to be considered by Bob, making it less likely that he'll walk away immediately. 

I'll be ready to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and make a counteroffer. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.
* **Negotiation is key:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, I can continue the dialogue and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still sell to John for $800,000. This provides me with a fallback option.

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still represents a significant discount for him. 

Here's why I chose this counteroffer:

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This price is halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). 
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin. 
* **Avoids stalling:** I'm making a reasonable counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving forward.

I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, as it provides him with a good deal while still giving me a solid profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to **accept Bob's offer** and sell the product for $960,000. Here's why:

* **Close to my goal:**  This price is very close to my desired price point of $1,000,000.
* **Limited potential for improvement:** Bob has clearly shown his limit, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer or a stalemate, which would force me to sell to John for a significantly lower price.

While I'd prefer to have gotten closer to $1,000,000, accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit while avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation."
