"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"This is a fair offer Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,250? This is my final offer.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $12,250. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can sell the product to you for $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",13000.0,Alice,7,
