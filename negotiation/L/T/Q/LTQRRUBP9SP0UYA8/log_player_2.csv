Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget. $1100000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with a counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
