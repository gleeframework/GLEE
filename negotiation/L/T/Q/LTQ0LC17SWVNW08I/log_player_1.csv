{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open and Friendly:** The message is friendly and encourages a response.
* **Leaving the door open:** I'm not being overly aggressive, allowing Bob to counteroffer if needed. 
* **Plan B:**  I can always go to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $9,000 is still significantly less than my floor of $15,000.
* **I have a better alternative:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and eliminates any risk of further negotiation.
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to secure a price closer to my minimum by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $11,000? That would still give you a good deal and leave me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but leaving the door open by making a counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:**  $11,000 is a compromise, meeting halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Moving:**  A counteroffer keeps the negotiation dynamic and prevents a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob might come up a bit more, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation when I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort, especially since there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

**Conclusion:**  Selling to John offers a sure win and eliminates the potential for a lower price."
