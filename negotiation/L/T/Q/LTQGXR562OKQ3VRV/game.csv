,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price we both like.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little higher than what I can afford right now.  Let's try $140. I really do want this product, and I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $150. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $145? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140. I really hope you can accept this offer, as I'm getting close to my limit and may have to explore other options.",140.0,Bob,6,
