"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to John for the same amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, and both Alice and John are offering it at that price, you might as well buy from John.  There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
