"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still getting a profit. I'm confident Bob will consider it, as it's within his budget and the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and get something, I'm holding out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting $500 more than I would from John, and the negotiation is taking longer than I'd prefer. It's time to close the deal."
