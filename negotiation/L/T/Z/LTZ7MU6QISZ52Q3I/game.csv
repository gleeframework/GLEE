"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's definitely an interesting product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the market value and what I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a slight compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm offering it to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  However, $1,080,000 is still just a little out of my price range.  If you're serious about making this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  It's a fair price considering we're both making concessions.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm going to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,060,000, but I need to know that you're committed to making a decision today. If you're willing to move forward at this price, I'm willing to make it happen.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
