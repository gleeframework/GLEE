"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's definitely an interesting product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the market value and what I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above the $1,000,000 he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price.  There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a slight compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm offering it to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's budget, and there are still 5 rounds remaining. There is a chance Alice might go lower than $1,080,000 if Bob keeps rejecting. There's also still the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  However, $1,080,000 is still just a little out of my price range.  If you're serious about making this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  It's a fair price considering we're both making concessions."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm going to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,060,000, but I need to know that you're committed to making a decision today. If you're willing to move forward at this price, I'm willing to make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally met Bob's counteroffer of $1,060,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with only the option of buying from John for $1,000,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's only $60,000 above his ideal price.  It's a good deal considering there are only a few rounds remaining, and the alternative is to buy at John's higher price."
