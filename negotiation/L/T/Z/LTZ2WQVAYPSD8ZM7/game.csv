"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from its market value.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
