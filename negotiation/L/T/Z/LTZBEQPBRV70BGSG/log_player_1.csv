Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To give you a head start before I consider other buyers, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I want to start with a price that reflects its value to him while aiming for a profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,200,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers and presenting a limited-time offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, ensuring I don't lose out."
