Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, my minimum acceptable price is that amount.  Offering it to Bob at $10,000 maximizes potential profit.
* **Direct Approach:**  While I could try negotiating, starting at my desired price is efficient. If Bob rejects the offer, I haven't wasted time haggling and can move on to John. 
* **Value Highlighting:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my bottom line. This framing might encourage Bob to reconsider even if he initially perceives the value as lower."
