"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's definitely not worth paying Alice's asking price. You can get the product for less from John, but it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is a significant discount from Alice's asking price and leaves room for potential negotiation. It also ensures that you're still getting a better price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still higher than what you can get from John.  It's worth seeing if you can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. You're meeting Alice halfway, offering a price significantly lower than her last offer, but still higher than John's price. This approach aims to show Alice you're serious about buying, but also trying to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer, but it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  You can get the product for less from John, and further negotiation with Alice might only lead to her becoming less willing to sell."
