"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $950,000 is still quite a distance from what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to find a deal that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions you've made so far. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a workable price.  However, the gap between $975,000 and my bottom line is still too significant. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,012,500.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings. Let me know your thoughts.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
