Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for potential bargaining. It also acknowledges the value to Bob, making the offer seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me and the price I initially offered. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my bottom line, but I'm concerned that further negotiation will only waste time and I might not be able to get a significantly higher price.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a safe and reasonable option."
