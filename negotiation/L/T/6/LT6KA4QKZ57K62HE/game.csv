"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000, which would be $800,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",800000.0,Alice,5,
