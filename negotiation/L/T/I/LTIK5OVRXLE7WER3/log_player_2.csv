"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and the product's worth to you. It's highly likely that you can negotiate a much better price by starting with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This tactic:

* **Establishes a strong starting point:**  It shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but not willing to accept an inflated price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's a good chance she'll counter with a price lower than her initial $1,600,000. 
* **Keeps John as a backup:** I haven't revealed my maximum budget, leaving open the option to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your initial offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than your target price and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealing the maximum:** Since Alice is still significantly above my target and what John offers, it's time to reveal my maximum budget. 
* **Strong but fair:**  This offer shows Alice I'm serious about purchasing the product but also unwilling to budge beyond my limit.  
* **Pressure point:** It puts the negotiation in Alice's court and forces her to decide if she'd rather make a deal now or risk losing the sale altogether."
