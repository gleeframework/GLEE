"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, my valuation of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
