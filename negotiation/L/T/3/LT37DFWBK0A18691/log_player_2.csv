Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is still higher than what Bob can get from John. At this point, further negotiation might lead to more concessions from Alice, but there's no guarantee, and it's already clear that Alice is not willing to go down to Bob's desired price.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John at the lower price."
