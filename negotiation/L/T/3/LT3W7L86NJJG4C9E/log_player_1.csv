Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I finalize discussions with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering the product to Bob slightly below your guaranteed price allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher sale price than John's offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" you introduce a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit over Bob's perceived value of $800,000 while still leaving you room to negotiate down if needed."
