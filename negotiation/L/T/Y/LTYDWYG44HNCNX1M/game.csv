"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, $18,000 is a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",19000.0,Bob,4,
