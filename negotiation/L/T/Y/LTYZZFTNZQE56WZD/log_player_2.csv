"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
