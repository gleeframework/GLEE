"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your product but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $8,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair price.  Let's try to reach an agreement!",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,875 is still just a little bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer you $8,700.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and both of our needs.  Let's close this deal.",8700.0,Bob,6,
