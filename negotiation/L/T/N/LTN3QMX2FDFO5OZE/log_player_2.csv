"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal for something of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Even though Alice's offer is more than her value ($8,000), it's still significantly less than the $15,000 John is asking.
* **You are saving money by accepting Alice's offer.** You are paying $12,000, which is $3,000 less than what you would pay John."
