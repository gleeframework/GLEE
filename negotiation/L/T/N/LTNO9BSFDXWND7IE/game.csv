"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $850,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a great price for you, and it's a significant step closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
