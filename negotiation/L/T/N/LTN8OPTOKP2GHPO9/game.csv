"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000, recognizing the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
