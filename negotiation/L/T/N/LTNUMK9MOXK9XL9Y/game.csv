"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that reflects its potential. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss a price of $950,000. This ensures you get a great deal, and I get a fair return on my investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,
