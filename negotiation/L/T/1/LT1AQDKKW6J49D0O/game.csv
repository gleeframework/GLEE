"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant investment and shows my genuine interest.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product to your business is significant and I can't quite let it go for that price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on offer.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $885,000. This price reflects a significant investment from my end and shows my commitment to this deal. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",885000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer, as it's a significant reduction and reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $890,000, which is a substantial investment and shows my strong interest in this product.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  What are your thoughts?",890000.0,Bob,6,
