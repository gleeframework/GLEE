"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting at $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make this deal worthwhile.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure we both walk away satisfied.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,325,000 isn't quite enough for me to make this happen.  Let's compromise at $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
