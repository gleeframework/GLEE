"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting at $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make this deal worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better price. He can attempt to meet in the middle again or make a slightly lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure we both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,325,000 isn't quite enough for me to make this happen.  Let's compromise at $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,340,000, which is only $40,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a good deal for Bob, as he's already saved $160,000 from his initial offer of $1,500,000.  

Continuing to negotiate might save a little more, but the risk of Alice rejecting and the time it takes to negotiate further isn't worth it.  It's a good deal for both parties and ensures a quick closure."
