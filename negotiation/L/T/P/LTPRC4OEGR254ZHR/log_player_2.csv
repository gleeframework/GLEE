"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is considerably higher than similar items on the market, and  $1,050,000 doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000?
