"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than what Bob would pay John ($15,000).  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $3,000."
