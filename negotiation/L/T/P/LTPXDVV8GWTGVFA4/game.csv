,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $101.25?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Can we meet at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
