"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $15,000.  This is higher than my minimum value of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm testing the waters to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is my minimum, it's still worth exploring if I can get more. Bob's offer is a clear sign he's interested, and I'm hoping to leverage that interest in the next round to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $13,500, still a good profit for me but showing willingness to compromise. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, hoping to encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price and is a significant improvement from his initial offer. It's time to accept and lock in a good deal. While I could try to squeeze out another $500, the risk of further negotiation falling apart and having to sell to John for $12,000 isn't worth it."
