"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? I believe this might be closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
