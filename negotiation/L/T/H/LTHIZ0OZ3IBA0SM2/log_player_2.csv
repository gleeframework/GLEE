"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've started with my maximum budget of $8,000 as my counteroffer.  This is a strong starting point and shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but have a firm price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best compromise at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my ideal price of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,500, which is closer to Alice's price, showing I'm willing to negotiate. This gives us more room to reach a middle ground in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely we'll be able to reach a deal that works for both of us.  I'm better off purchasing from John, who is willing to sell me the product at my desired price."
