"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best compromise at this point.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
