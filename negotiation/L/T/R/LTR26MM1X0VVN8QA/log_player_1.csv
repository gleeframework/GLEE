Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $200. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $150 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I know I can get $150 from John, so it's the best choice to ensure I get a fair price."
