"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.
