Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
