"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,250? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $11,375 for this. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",11375.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $11,375 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $11,250 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",11250.0,Bob,6,
