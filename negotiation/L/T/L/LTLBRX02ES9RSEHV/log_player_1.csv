Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 6

I've reached a point where it's clear Bob isn't willing to go much higher. Since I'm unlikely to get a significantly better offer from him, I'll sell to John for $12,000 and ensure I get my minimum price."
