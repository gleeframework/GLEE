# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that is truly a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is also interested in purchasing it for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is the same price as what Bob would pay John, there's no advantage to accepting.  By rejecting, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy from John."
