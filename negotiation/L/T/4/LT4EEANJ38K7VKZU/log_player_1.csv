"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is close to my desired price and is better than the guaranteed $8,000 from John.  It's worth accepting the offer to secure a deal."
