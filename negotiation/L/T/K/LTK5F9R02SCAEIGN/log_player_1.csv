"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel more comfortable with the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to make the price seem more justified.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. Starting with a high price allows me to potentially negotiate a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm also keeping in mind the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John. This will help me decide whether to be more aggressive or accommodating in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on a sale. It also avoids potentially wasting time on further negotiation, given the 10-round limit. 

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale at my minimum threshold. This allows me to move on to other potential opportunities.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
