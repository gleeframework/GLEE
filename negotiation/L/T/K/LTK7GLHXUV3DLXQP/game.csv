"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. I'm asking for $900,000 for it. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential. I'm confident that this purchase will be a sound investment for you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. If you decline, I have another interested party ready to purchase at a lower price.",900000.0,Alice,1,
