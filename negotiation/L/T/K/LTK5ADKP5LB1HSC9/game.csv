"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend. Let's try $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and what you're looking to get for the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
