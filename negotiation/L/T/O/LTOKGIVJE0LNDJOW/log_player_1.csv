"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a high price, but it reflects the unique value I know this product offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing the unique value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him see the potential worth even if it exceeds his initial assessment.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for a negotiation by stating my price is ""high"" and asking for Bob's thoughts. 

I'm optimistic that Bob will counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate down from here. However, I have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't yield a better result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below the value I place on the product. Accepting would leave me with a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer demonstrates his genuine interest, so there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can continue the discussion and potentially find a price that's more favorable for me.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** Selling to John is always a safe option, but I'd prefer to get a better price if possible.  I'm optimistic that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations while still securing a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad you're interested in the product.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  This product is unique, and I'm confident it will deliver substantial value for you. Let's find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still holding firm to a price that reflects the product's value to me. 
* **Maintaining Confidence:** I continue to highlight the product's unique value and potential benefits for Bob, hoping to keep him engaged and motivated to compromise.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** I emphasize finding a price that works for both of us, implying I'm open to further negotiation but not willing to settle for a significantly low price.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will keep the negotiations going while putting me in a stronger position to achieve a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a valuable product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would allow me to make the purchase while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Bob's willingness to increase his offer indicates that there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option, I want to explore if I can do better with Bob. I'm not giving up on negotiation just yet.

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap and find a price that is more favorable for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this work. We're both very close to a deal, and I believe this product will truly exceed your expectations. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:** I'm continuing to demonstrate flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still maintaining a price point that's above my minimum.
* **Maintaining the Value Focus:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value and potential to exceed his expectations. This helps keep the emphasis on the product's worth and not just the price.
* **Seeking a Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing the shared goal of finding a solution that benefits both of us. This reinforces the idea that we're working together to achieve a mutually agreeable outcome.

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be enough to reach an agreement with Bob, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to find a way to make this work, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This would be a fair compromise and let us both walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting would mean a loss for me, even if it's a small one. 
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise and we're both very close to a deal.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would guarantee my minimum price, but I'd prefer to secure a higher price if possible. I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation just yet.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the small gap and find a price that works for both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  $975,000 is a very fair offer, and I'm almost ready to accept.  However, to make this truly work for me, I need to be at $1,000,000.  This price reflects the unique value this product holds, and it would allow me to move forward with this sale. I believe we're both so close to a win-win situation here. Let's see if we can agree on this final number?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a final push for my minimum acceptable price, highlighting that I'm willing to compromise but need to secure at least $1,000,000.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's unique value to reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Win-Win Focus:** I emphasize the potential for a ""win-win"" scenario, reminding Bob of the benefits of reaching an agreement.

I believe this counteroffer will push Bob to accept my minimum price, as we're both very close to a deal.  If he rejects, I have the option to sell to John for the same price, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal."
