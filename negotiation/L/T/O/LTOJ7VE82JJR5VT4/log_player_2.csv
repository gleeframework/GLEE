"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  I'm willing to pay up to $150, but I'll try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I've already compromised a bit from my initial price. I can meet you halfway between $120 and $100, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to get the price down further.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $110.  How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. How about I throw in a free accessory worth $10, and we can do the deal for $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a great deal for me!  Alice has lowered her price to my target of $105 and is even including a free accessory worth $10.  This is a good compromise, and I can save $45 compared to buying from John.  I'm happy to accept this offer."
