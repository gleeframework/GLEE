It's a great deal to get the product for $500,000, but we can likely do better.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Let's start with a significantly lower offer of $300,000. This is a bold move, but we'll see how Alice reacts. If she rejects, we can gradually increase the price in subsequent rounds."

Alice has come down quite a bit, and $475,000 is a reasonable price.  We've saved over a million dollars compared to buying from John. Let's accept this offer and move on!"
