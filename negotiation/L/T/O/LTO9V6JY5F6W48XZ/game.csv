"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering its potential.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be a worthwhile one for you. Please let me know your decision. ",1550000.0,Alice,1,
