Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a higher price than my guaranteed value from John, giving me the potential for a higher profit. 

Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob values the product at more than $900,000, he's likely to accept. If he values it lower, he'll likely reject, and I can still secure my $800,000 from John. This strategy balances potential gain with minimizing potential loss."
