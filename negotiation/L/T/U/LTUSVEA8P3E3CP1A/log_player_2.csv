"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  While it's a concession, it's still $200,000 more than Bob's maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also acknowledging the value it holds for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer, but still $125,000 over Bob's limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make it. However, I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to sell the product for less than $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. It's a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value I place on the product and the value it holds for you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $900,000 is still $100,000 over Bob's limit. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the product. At this point, it's more financially advantageous for Bob to buy from John at $800,000 and secure the product."
