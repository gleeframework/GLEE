"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1000000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $850000 at this time. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also acknowledging the value it holds for you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $925000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm prepared to offer $875000, which is a substantial amount for me and reflects the value I place on this product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $875000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make it. However, I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to sell the product for less than $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. It's a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value I place on the product and the value it holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
