{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This demonstrates my seriousness about buying the product but also sets a clear expectation that I'm looking for a better price.  It's a strong starting point for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial counteroffer of $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $800,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a significant discount.  It's a reasonable middle ground that might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is closer to my desired price range.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might get stubborn and stick to her price, or I could run out of rounds before reaching a deal.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, and I've still saved $150,000 compared to buying from John."
