Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you something incredibly valuable that I know you'd be very interested in. While I have other buyers willing to pay top dollar, I believe this product would be uniquely beneficial to you. I'm willing to make a special offer just for you: $900,000."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Since Bob values the product at $800,000, offering it slightly below our guaranteed price with John incentivizes Bob.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers, we create a sense of urgency and competition, making Bob more likely to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we aim for $900,000, starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, still landing us a great deal."
