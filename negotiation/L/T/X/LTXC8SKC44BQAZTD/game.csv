"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we start at $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $120.  This is the highest I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
