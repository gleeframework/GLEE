Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is far too high for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

``` 

While I could continue pushing for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is a significant profit. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and risking those extra dollars for a potentially smaller gain isn't worth jeopardizing the deal."
