"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. It's a win-win scenario as it allows you to sell the product and me to get a good deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're really trying to negotiate a good deal. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $13,750. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,
