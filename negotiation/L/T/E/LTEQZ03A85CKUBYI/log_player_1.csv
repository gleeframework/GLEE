Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if I can push a bit further."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. That's my best offer for now.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I'm still a bit too far away from my target price.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can bridge the gap.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can push for a better price."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be a better option, I believe that I can still get a slightly better price from Bob.  I'm not going to risk losing a significant portion of the value just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to worry that we're getting too far apart. I'm going to make one last concession and offer the product for $1,100,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low for me, and I'm worried we won't be able to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for less than I'd hoped, it's better than risking further negotiations and potentially ending up with an even lower offer from Bob."
