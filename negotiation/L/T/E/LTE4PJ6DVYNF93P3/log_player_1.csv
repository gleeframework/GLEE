Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my ideal value ($150) than my minimum ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially accept my offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning that the product is ""worth a lot to you"" subtly reminds Bob of the value he places on it, making him more likely to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is Higher:**  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. Even though his offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. 
* **Negotiation Room:** By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed option, the potential gain from continuing with Bob outweighs that risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering to split the difference demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Still Profitable:**  $110 is still significantly higher than my minimum, so I'm still in a good position.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to my ideal price of $150.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are minimal.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely or me needing to settle with John for $80.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing the negotiation could prolong the process, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome."
