"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate downward from $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $120 feels a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but justifiable:** Starting with a low offer of $80 aims to understand Alice's bottom line. While it might seem aggressive, it's within my acceptable price range and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and direct:** The message is courteous but clearly states my desired price, avoiding any ambiguity. 
* **Gauging Alice's flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she outright rejects it, I know I'll need to increase my offer significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $100, given its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a significant amount from her initial offer, which is a good sign.  However, $100 is still above my target price. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $80 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By offering $90, I'm splitting the difference between her current offer ($100) and my previous counteroffer ($80). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Seeking a mutually beneficial agreement:** The message emphasizes fairness and finding a solution that works for both parties. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While I'm compromising, I'm not drastically increasing my offer. This signals that I'm still looking for a good deal."
