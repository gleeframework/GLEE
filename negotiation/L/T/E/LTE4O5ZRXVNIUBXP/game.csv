"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $120 feels a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $100, given its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $80 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
