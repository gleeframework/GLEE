"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I'm confident this price is fair considering the value it holds for me and your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me while also being fair to you.  Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a balance between the product's value to you and a fair price. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,150,000. I'm offering it to you for $1,225,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
