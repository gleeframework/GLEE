"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still offering a price above your target, even after acknowledging the product's value to you. It's worth attempting another counteroffer to see if you can push her down further.  There's still potential to negotiate a better price, and you haven't lost anything by rejecting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me while also being fair to you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a balance between the product's value to you and a fair price. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,150,000. I'm offering it to you for $1,225,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still higher than your ideal price, but it's close enough to your target and within your budget.  You've already made a few counteroffers and there's a risk that Alice will continue to hold firm or even increase her price.  Accepting the offer allows you to acquire the product while saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
