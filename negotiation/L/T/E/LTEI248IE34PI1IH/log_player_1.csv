{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point for negotiation. It's a significant markup from my minimum value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Why this approach?**

* **Setting the bar high:** Starting with a higher price allows for more flexibility in negotiation and increases the chance of getting a better price.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the potential value for Bob positions the product as a good investment, increasing his willingness to negotiate.
* **Opening for counteroffers:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, ensuring the negotiation process continues. 
* **Plan B:**  The knowledge of John's offer provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider offering the product at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** While $10,000 is my minimum value, I know the product is worth more than that. Accepting his offer at this stage would be a loss for me.
* **Proceed to next round:**  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counter-offer and see if Bob is willing to budge. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me leverage in negotiations. I don't need to accept a low price just to make a sale."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to recoup my investment.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,500?  This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my value.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the ""value"" and ""investment"" aspects, reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his initial offer. 
* **Positive tone:** I keep the message friendly and focus on finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Open for further discussion:** I end the message with a question, encouraging Bob to engage and potentially negotiate further.

This approach is designed to:

* **Maintain a higher price point:** I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Show flexibility:** The compromise demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain my position:**  I'm not completely giving in, which reinforces the product's value. 
* **Keep the negotiation going:** I'm setting the stage for a possible counteroffer from Bob, allowing me to potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget, could we discuss a price closer to $9500? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $9,500 is still below my ideal price point.  
* **Proceed to next round:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than $9,500. 
* **John's offer as leverage:**  I have a safety net with John's offer, so I don't feel pressured to accept a low price just to make a sale. 

I will counteroffer again, aiming to secure a price closer to my $10,000 minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000?

I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to consider $10500 as a compromise between our positions. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still obtaining the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's offer:**  Bob has offered $10,500, which is above my minimum value of $10,000.  This is a good outcome considering I'm close to my minimum and there's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower price.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  I have a safety net with John's offer, so I'm not under pressure to accept a very low price. However, the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential reward in this case.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a price above my minimum and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
