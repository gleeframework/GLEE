"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a good starting point for further negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is closer to my minimum price, and I'm hoping it will be more appealing to Bob. It's a fair compromise and shows I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I still think I can get more. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can finalize the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to offer $800,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will accept. If he rejects, I'll be forced to sell to John for the same price.  I'm running out of rounds and want to secure the deal."

I'm running out of time.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I can't risk going lower and losing out on the guaranteed sale to John.  It's time to move on and ensure I secure the minimum price I'm willing to accept."
