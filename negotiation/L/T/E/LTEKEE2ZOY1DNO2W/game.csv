"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is far below its true value and frankly, too low for me to consider.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply won't work for me. This product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident that we can find a price that benefits both of us. I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's move forward with this mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
