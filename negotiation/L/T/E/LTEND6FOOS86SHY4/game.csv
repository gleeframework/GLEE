,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $19,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $14,500 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
