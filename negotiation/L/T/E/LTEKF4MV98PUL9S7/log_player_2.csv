Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $810,000, which is a bit above your last offer. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $810,000 gets you a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
