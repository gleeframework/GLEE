Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $9000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  This is a fair price that allows me to continue negotiating with you and gives you a great deal on a valuable product.
