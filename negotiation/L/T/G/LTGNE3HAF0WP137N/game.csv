,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $147.50? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",147.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $135 just isn't enough for me to let this go.  I'm willing to come down to $142.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with this product.",142.5,Alice,5,
