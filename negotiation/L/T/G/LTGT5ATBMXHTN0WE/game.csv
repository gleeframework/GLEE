"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is well above my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000.  This offer represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire an asset of this caliber.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profit for you and a reasonable investment for me.  Let's find a way to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're at a bit of an impasse.  While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I can't go as low as $1,300,000.  Would you consider $1,600,000? This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,500,000?  This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
