"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the value to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate, but still ensuring I get a decent profit. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to him, making it more likely he'll consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need at least $12,500 for this. It's still a great price for a product you value at $12,000. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I've already reached the point where selling to John would give me the same amount, so there's no benefit in continuing to negotiate."
