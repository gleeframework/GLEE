You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is too low for me to consider, but I'm flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer, I can't go that low.  My absolute bottom line is $14,000. I believe this product offers significant value, and that's a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,000. It's not worth risking a higher counteroffer when you can get the product for $12,000 from John."
