"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $9500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $8500? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8750?  That's closer to my budget and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $8900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",8900.0,Alice,5,
