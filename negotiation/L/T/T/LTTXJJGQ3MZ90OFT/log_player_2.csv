"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. You know Alice values the product at $8,000, so she has some flexibility in her price.  By rejecting this offer, you might encourage Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation. You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
