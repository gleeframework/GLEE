,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
