"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to reject the offer and make a counteroffer. You want to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still above your maximum price point."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit high.  You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"

Alice has come down in price but is still too high for your budget. It's better to buy from John and save the time and hassle of further negotiation."
