"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, as it is to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted rate of $900,000, recognizing the value you'll gain from it. Please let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $800,000. This still represents a considerable discount for you while allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $750,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
