"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get a great product at a good value."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $10,250? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price if I keep negotiating. I'm also concerned that if I accept this offer, Bob might try to renegotiate further in the future."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your effort.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750, which is a significant drop from my initial offer.  This price is fair to both of us and allows you to get the product within your budget.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500, but I need you to meet me at that price. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,000,  Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum and I don't want to risk him walking away completely. It's also possible that he may not be willing to go any higher, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
