You should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

I'm offering Alice half of her asking price. This is a significant discount, and it shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to overpay."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's better than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'll try to negotiate further."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,250,000.  This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's significantly higher than my initial offer, but it's also within my budget. I hope this is a good compromise for both of us."

I'm offering Alice $1,400,000. This is getting close to my maximum budget, but it's still a decent price for Alice, and it gives us both some room to compromise."

Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget, but it's still a bit too high.  Given that John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, it's better to buy it from him. It's less risk and saves me some money."
