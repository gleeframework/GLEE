,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $8,200 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,200.  It's a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $8,800 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $8,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. I'm confident this is the last offer I can make. Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. I'm willing to compromise at $8,700. This is as close as I can get to meeting your budget while still making a fair profit. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,700 is still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,600. I've already shown a willingness to compromise, and this offer is a fair price for both of us.  I hope we can reach an agreement and finalize this deal.",8600.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,9,
