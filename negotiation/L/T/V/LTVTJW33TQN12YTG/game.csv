"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. I understand the value of this product to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999,000. This represents a significant opportunity for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product at a price just below your estimated value, and it allows me to earn a substantial profit. Please consider my offer carefully, as I'm confident it's in both our best interests.",999000.0,Alice,1,
