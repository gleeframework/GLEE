"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is too low for me to accept at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make some progress towards my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's preferred price of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."

However, to show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting closer to Bob's desired price, but $1,100,000 is still outside Bob's budget. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price.  He can either try to counteroffer again or consider buying from John."
