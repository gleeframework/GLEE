{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,500, which is within Bob's budget and represents a decent savings compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers and he might be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids potential delays and complications."
