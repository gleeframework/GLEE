Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Starting with a price of $175 offers a decent markup from your minimum while still being potentially attractive to Bob if he values the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $175. If you want to ensure a sale and are willing to accept a smaller profit, you could offer a price closer to $150."
