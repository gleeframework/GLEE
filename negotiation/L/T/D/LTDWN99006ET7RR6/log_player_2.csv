"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than its worth to her, you can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John.  There's no need to negotiate further with Alice since you have a better option available."
