"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to me and its potential value to you.  Let me know what you think!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice.  Bob can then purchase the product from John for $12,000, staying within his budget."
