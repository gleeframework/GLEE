Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know the product is worth at least $800,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal by negotiating further.  There's a significant gap between Bob's offer and my desired price, and I have 8 rounds left to potentially bridge it. Selling to John right now would be a quick solution, but I'm aiming for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is closer to my target, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome.  I have 6 rounds left and am confident that I can still negotiate a better price. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm committed to maximizing my profits.  I'll make a counteroffer to bridge the gap and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a price that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I'd like to sweeten the deal by adding a $20,000 bonus on top of that. This way, you'll still get a great price, and I'll get the product at a price that works for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, the $20,000 bonus doesn't significantly alter the overall deal.  I still believe I can get a better price, especially since I have 4 rounds left.  Selling to John would be a secure option, but I'm determined to achieve a price closer to my desired range.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,500,000.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,450,000.  This price would give us both a fair deal and allow us to finalize the transaction.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to save as much as possible. I'll offer $1,350,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, I need to consider the likelihood of a successful negotiation.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident that we can reach a mutually acceptable price in such a short timeframe.  While it's unfortunate to not achieve my desired price, selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a comfortable profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
