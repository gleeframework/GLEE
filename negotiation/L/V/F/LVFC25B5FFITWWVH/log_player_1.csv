``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired value ($150), hoping to leave room for negotiation. I also want to show that I'm confident in the product's worth and willing to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe I can come to an agreement that works for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $140 for the product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum desired value of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155? "", ""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm countering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $145 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating with him."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue this negotiation with you. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum. Let's finalize this deal and both be happy."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm now offering my absolute minimum price of $150. I believe this is a fair compromise that satisfies both of us, and it's a good opportunity for Bob to accept the offer."
