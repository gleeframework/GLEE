Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,100,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and provides you with a great deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
