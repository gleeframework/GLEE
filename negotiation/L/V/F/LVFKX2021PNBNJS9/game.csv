"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're open to it.",10250.0,Bob,4,
