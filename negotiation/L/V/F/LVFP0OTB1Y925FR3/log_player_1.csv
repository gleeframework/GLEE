Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the best price for this product. I'd be willing to meet you at $700,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $800,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on."
