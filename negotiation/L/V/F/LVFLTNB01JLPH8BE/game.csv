"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I think that's fair to both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",90.0,Bob,4,
