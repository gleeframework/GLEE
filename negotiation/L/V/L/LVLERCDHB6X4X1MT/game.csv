"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious offer for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This price reflects the value it brings while still being a good deal for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm eager to hear your response.",950000.0,Bob,4,
