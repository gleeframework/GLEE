"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?  I'm really interested in this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,250 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
