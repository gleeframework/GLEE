Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for the value of this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price. You have a good chance of getting the product for less than $10,000."
