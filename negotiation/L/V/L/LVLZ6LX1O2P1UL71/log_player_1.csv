Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start at his valuation. There's room for negotiation, and starting higher gives us that space.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob might think.
* **""Special Price"":**  Framing the offer as a ""special price"" creates a sense of exclusivity and might make Bob more inclined to accept. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $12,000 aims to secure a deal significantly above Bob's valuation while leaving room for potential counter-offers. It also ensures a profit even if we need to go down slightly in negotiations.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
