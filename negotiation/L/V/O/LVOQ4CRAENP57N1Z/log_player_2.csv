Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $95?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $105, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price to $105, it's still above Bob's $80 limit.  Bob has already made two counteroffers and it's clear Alice is not going to budge much further. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring he gets the product at his desired price."
