# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  He can either negotiate with Alice or buy from John, but $1,450,000 is too high."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can finalize this.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, $1,375,000 is still a good deal for him, and he's getting closer to his target of saving as much money as possible.  Going back and forth could risk Alice getting frustrated and going back to her original price or Bob being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
