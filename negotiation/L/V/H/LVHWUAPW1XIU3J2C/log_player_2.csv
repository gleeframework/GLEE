"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's start at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is a good deal, he can likely get it for less by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to lower the price to $107. Is this within your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. While $107 is closer to his target, he's determined to push for a lower price.  He's only $7 away from his desired price of $100, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $107 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to meet me at $103?  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 103}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're finding the product valuable. I've decided to further adjust my price to $105. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is very close to his target price of $100. However, Alice's final offer of $105 is still a bit higher than he's willing to pay, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John, who is offering the product for his desired price.  This ensures he gets the product at the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
