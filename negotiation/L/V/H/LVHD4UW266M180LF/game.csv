"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $950000 is a great starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $850000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe this price reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
