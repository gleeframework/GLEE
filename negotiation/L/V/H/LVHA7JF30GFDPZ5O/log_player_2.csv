"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it has a lot of potential to benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a significant profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $900,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and within Bob's budget. Accepting this offer means Bob saves $300,000 compared to buying from John.  While there might be potential for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John makes accepting Alice's offer the best choice."
