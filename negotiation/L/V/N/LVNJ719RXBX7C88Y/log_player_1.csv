"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the absolute maximum he's willing to pay.  There's no room for negotiation to reach a price that's acceptable to me (above $150). Since John is offering $150, I'm guaranteed to get my minimum acceptable price by selling to him."
