Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,500,000?** I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. Since I know John will pay $1,200,000, I'm confident in asking for more from Bob.  
* **Why not go higher?**  Going too high risks Bob rejecting the offer. I want to balance getting the best price with the chance of losing the deal. 
* **What happens next?** I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, I've made a profit. If he rejects, I can confidently sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
