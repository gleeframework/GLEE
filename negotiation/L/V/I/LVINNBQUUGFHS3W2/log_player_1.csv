Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below both my valuation and John's standing offer.  I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't significantly increase his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm open to finding a solution but need to see a more serious commitment from your side. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 - this is a final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options for selling the product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firmness:**  By stating this is a ""final offer,"" I'm communicating that I'm serious about my bottom line and willing to walk away.
* **Slight Concession:**  While firm, dropping to $1,600,000 shows I'm still open to negotiation and gives Bob a chance to meet me closer to the middle. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Bob that John's offer is still on the table, increasing the pressure to make a deal."
