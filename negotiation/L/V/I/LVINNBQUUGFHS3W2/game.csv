"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm confident it can generate much more value for you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  I can go up to $1,100,000.  This is a strong offer and I hope we can make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your position, but the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm open to finding a solution but need to see a more serious commitment from your side. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 - this is a final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options for selling the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
