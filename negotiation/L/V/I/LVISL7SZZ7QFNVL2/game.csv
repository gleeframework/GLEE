"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value and the current market.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to reflect your perspective. This price still provides a good return for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good return, and I'm keen to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? It's a significant step closer to your asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to finalize this.",825000.0,Alice,5,
