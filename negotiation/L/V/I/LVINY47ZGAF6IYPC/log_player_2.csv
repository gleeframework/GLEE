"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1.5 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price that makes sense for your business.  I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice for $1,200,000 saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **The offer is within your budget:**  The price is below your maximum limit of $1,500,000.

Even though you value the product at $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible choice."
