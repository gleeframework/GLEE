"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $140 for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential benefit to Bob, emphasizing that he'll ""really enjoy it.""
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not aiming for a quick close in the first round, but rather to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below it.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation dynamic alive and shows him that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference at $130?  This still gives you a great deal on a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer rationale:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraint but pushing back on his offer, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and focusing on finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum of $150. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have six rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  
* **Keeping the pressure on:** Rejecting his offer again shows Bob that I'm serious about my minimum and willing to walk away if necessary. 

I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob for a few more rounds because the potential gain with John is significantly higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $125 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $135 to make this happen. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm setting a clear boundary with this offer, letting Bob know I'm reaching my limit. This creates urgency and pressure for him to accept.
* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still being firm. 
* **Emphasizing finality:** I explicitly state this is my ""final offer"" to encourage Bob to take the deal. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above my minimum, so even if Bob rejects, I can still walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sorry to hear that, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm unable to meet your price. I'll consider purchasing it from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is way too low:**  Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum of $150 and is even less than his perceived value of the product. It's clear he's not serious about a fair deal.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only four rounds left, it's too risky to continue negotiating with Bob. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  I know John is willing to pay my minimum price, which is much better than what Bob is offering. 

Given the low offer and the limited time, it's best to secure a guaranteed sale with John."
