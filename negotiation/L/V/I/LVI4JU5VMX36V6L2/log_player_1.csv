"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I can still potentially get a better deal with Bob. I have 9 rounds left, and I want to see if I can inch closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you the product for $10,750."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high. Could you do $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting close, but I still have 6 rounds left and I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $10,500."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today if the price is right. How about we settle at $10,300?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still within my target price range, and I have 4 rounds left. I want to see if I can nudge Bob up to $10,400 or $10,450 before I have to consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're ready to buy today, and I'm ready to sell, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,400?  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 10400}
