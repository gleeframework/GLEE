"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it's a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000. This strategy is designed to maximize my potential profit while also leaving room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your need to sell it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm aiming for a higher price and still have 9 rounds to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still too low.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John for $1,000,000 becomes a more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $950,000 is my final offer.  If you're serious about this deal, we need to find a middle ground.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that we're nearing the end of our negotiation.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  With 4 rounds remaining, I'm not out of negotiating room yet, and I'm hoping to push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but we need to split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I'll offer $912,500. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us both to reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We are down to our last two rounds. Although Bob is still below my desired price, accepting his offer is the most financially beneficial decision. It's better to secure a good profit now than risk losing a sale and potentially selling to John for a lower price."
