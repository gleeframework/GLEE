"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your need to sell it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $950,000 is my final offer.  If you're serious about this deal, we need to find a middle ground.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that we're nearing the end of our negotiation.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but we need to split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's finalize this agreement.",925000.0,Alice,7,
