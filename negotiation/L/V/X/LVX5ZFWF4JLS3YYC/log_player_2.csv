"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but you can likely do better.** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $12,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps your options open.** You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or you can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This sets the tone for negotiation and shows I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  While $10,000 is a low starting point, it's still within my acceptable range and allows for Alice to counter with a price closer to the middle ground.
* **Strategic first move:**  By making a bold counteroffer, I'm hoping to quickly gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially end the negotiation sooner."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to my limit, but still too high.**  I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, so $14,000 is within striking distance. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** I believe I can still get a better price with another counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John for now:** While $15,000 is my absolute limit, I'd prefer to save money if possible. I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Alice yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm raising my offer to $12,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and indicates I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:** This offer allows me to gauge how much Alice is willing to come down. If she accepts, I get a good deal. If she rejects, I can adjust my next offer accordingly.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer, I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but not quite there.**  I'm still $500 away from my absolute maximum with Alice, and I want to see if I can get that final bit of savings.
* **Counteroffers are still working:** Alice is willing to negotiate, so I don't want to give up on getting a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup, not a preference:** I'd rather save the extra $500, if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is my final counteroffer before potentially going to John. 
* **Meeting halfway again:**  I'm increasing my offer again, aiming for a compromise between my last offer and Alice's current price. This shows a clear willingness to negotiate.
* **Creating pressure:** By making a higher offer, I'm hoping to push Alice into accepting. If she rejects, I'm likely going to John on the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is my limit:**  I'm not willing to pay more than $15,000, and her offer is at that price.
* **Negotiation stalled:** Alice has been unwilling to budge on her offer for several rounds, suggesting she won't go lower.
* **Saving time and effort:** It's better to buy from John and end the negotiation than to continue going back and forth with Alice without any progress.
* **John provides certainty:** Buying from John guarantees I get the product and eliminates the risk of further failed negotiations."
