Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his top price is $750,000.  He's unlikely to go higher, especially since he's stated he has alternative options.  While continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly higher offer from Bob, it's too risky. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's standing offer of $1,200,000. It's time to cut bait and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
