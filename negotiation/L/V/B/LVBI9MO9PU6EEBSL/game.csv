"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That said, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $975,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be transparent, I have a firm budget in mind. I'd be willing to go up to $720,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  I'm willing to consider a lower price, but only if it reflects the value of this product. Could you meet me halfway at $847,500?",847500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but that price is still a bit beyond my limit.  To be completely transparent, I've also explored other options and can purchase a similar product for $800,000.  To make this work, my absolute maximum is $750,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,
