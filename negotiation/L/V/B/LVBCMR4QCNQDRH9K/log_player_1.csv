Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I know the product is worth more to me than $15,000. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm offering $17,500,  which is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and higher than John's offer.  I'm also getting closer to my desired value with each round."
