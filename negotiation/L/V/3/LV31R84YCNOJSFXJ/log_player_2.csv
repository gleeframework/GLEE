"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know you'll find valuable. I think it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the value of this product. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, he still has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter will hopefully allow Bob to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
