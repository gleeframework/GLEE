"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the value of this product. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
