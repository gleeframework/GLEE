"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, you can potentially save more by counteroffering. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for Alice to profit. It also signals your intent to negotiate and find a price that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is still within your budget and only $5 more than your counteroffer. This is a reasonable compromise, and accepting the offer secures the product at a good price.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will walk away or you'll end up buying from John at a higher price."
