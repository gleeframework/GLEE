I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is a good starting point as it is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $90. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to him."
