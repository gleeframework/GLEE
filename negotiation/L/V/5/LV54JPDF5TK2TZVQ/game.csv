"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower. How about $1,000,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
