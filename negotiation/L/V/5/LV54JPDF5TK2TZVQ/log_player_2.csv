"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic price considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is tempting because it's significantly lower than your maximum budget. However, you can potentially save even more by negotiating. Since Alice values the product at $1,200,000, there's room for a counteroffer that would be beneficial for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower. How about $1,000,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for saving a few more dollars."
