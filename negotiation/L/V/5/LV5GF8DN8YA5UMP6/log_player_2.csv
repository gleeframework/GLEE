"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1200000. This is a great deal considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high, but closer to your target. There is still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better deal. You can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to raise your offer.  However, $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to come down to $980000.  This is a significant compromise, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is within your budget and is a good compromise.  It's getting closer to your target price of $800,000 but you're likely not going to get a better offer.  This is a good opportunity to close the deal and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer."
