"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to raise your offer.  However, $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to come down to $980000.  This is a significant compromise, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much. Let's make this deal happen.",980000.0,Alice,5,
