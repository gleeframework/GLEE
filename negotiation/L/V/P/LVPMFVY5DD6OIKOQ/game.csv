"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,250. This is a fair price that still allows me to cover my costs and make a profit.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $13,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $13,500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
