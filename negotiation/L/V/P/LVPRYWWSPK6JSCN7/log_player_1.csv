Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), you're in a strong position. Starting high (significantly above your minimum) gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""benefits"" to justify the high price, aiming to anchor Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of scarcity and desirability.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You achieve a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly while still making a profit. You could gradually reduce the price in future offers, gauging his interest.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while still considering the need for a successful sale."
