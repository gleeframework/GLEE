"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,750,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This would give us both a fair price and help move the deal forward.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,475,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1475000.0,Bob,4,
