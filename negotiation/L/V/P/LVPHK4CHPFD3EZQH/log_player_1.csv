Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John is a guaranteed $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still staying above the $150 John is offering. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price might make Bob more inclined to accept."
