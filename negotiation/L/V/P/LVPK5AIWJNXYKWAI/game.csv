"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me!  $150 is a bit steep for me though.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",135.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $135 is a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $138?  I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and that's the absolute most I can do.",138.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $139? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to sweeten the deal, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment.",139.0,Alice,5,
