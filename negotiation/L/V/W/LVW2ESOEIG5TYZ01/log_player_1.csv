Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1400000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This price represents a good compromise, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
