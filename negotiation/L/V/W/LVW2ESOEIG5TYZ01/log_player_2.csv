"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you justifies a price of $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still higher than his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1250000 is tempting, it's significantly below what I need to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This price represents a good compromise, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's try to close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1325000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still higher than Bob's budget, and it's only $25,000 lower than her previous offer. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that reaching his desired price with Alice might be difficult. 

Given the limited rounds and Alice's potential for further counteroffers, it's more advantageous for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John at $1,200,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially getting stuck with a higher price in the remaining rounds."
