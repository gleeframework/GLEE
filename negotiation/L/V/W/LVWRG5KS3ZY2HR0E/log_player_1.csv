Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120 is a good starting point:** It's more than your minimum ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **A friendly message:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Asking for Bob's opinion:** This encourages engagement and lets him know you're open to discussion. 

This approach balances the need to maximize your profit with the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to go down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than $80 (John's offer), it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob ($150) and leaves you with less profit than your initial offer.  

It's worth pushing for a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you are willing to negotiate while still getting a good price. 
* **Fairness:** Highlighting the ""fairness"" for both of you can make the offer more appealing. 
* **Clear price:**  A specific price avoids ambiguity and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $105?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your goal:** $105 is significantly closer to your initial desired price point ($120) than John's offer of $80.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While you could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away.  Accepting $105 ensures a profitable sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 
* **Mutual benefit:**  The message shows you are trying to reach a solution that works for both parties. This can help maintain a positive relationship even if the price is not ideal."
