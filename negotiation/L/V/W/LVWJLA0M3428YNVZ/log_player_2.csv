"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your maximum value:** You're willing to pay $100.
* **Alice's offer:**  $90
* **John's price:** $100

You can get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $10."
