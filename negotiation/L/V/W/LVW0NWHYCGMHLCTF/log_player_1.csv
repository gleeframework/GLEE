{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price of $80, but it's still below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a bit more, Alice. How about $78? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum price of $80, it's still not quite there.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  It's not the best possible outcome, but it's a guaranteed sale, and it meets my minimum requirements."
