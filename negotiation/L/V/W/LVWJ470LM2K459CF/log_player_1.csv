"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum, but it's still a good starting point. Bob is likely to counter-offer, but I want to see how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects this, I'll likely adjust my price based on his counteroffer, or even consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but if not, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,200 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000. I'll counter-offer in the next round. If he rejects that, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,600. I'm starting to get a little nervous about Bob's willingness to pay, so I'm lowering my price a bit more to try to close the deal. If he rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We're getting close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn.  I'm willing to accept the $9,300 offer and close the deal.  There's always a chance Bob might come back with a higher offer, but it's not worth risking it with only four rounds left."
