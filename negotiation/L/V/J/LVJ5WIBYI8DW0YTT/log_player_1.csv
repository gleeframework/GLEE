{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd rather sell to him than John, I'm not willing to lose that much money. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's also closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, I'm willing to accept $9,500 to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential loss.  I'll also avoid selling to John, as I'd prefer to complete the deal with Bob if the price is reasonable."
