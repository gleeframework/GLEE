Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a significant amount, but it's still below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. I believe this offer is attractive enough for him to consider while still giving me a substantial profit.  I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $700,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to Bob's perceived value. I believe this offer is fair and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to make me comfortable. I've already lowered my price twice, and I'm not sure Bob is willing to meet me in the middle. To avoid further negotiation and potential frustration, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I get a fair price and avoids any further risk of Bob's counteroffers."
