"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely get a better price than $11,000. It's worth starting the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, leaving room for negotiation while still being a price that would save me a good amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to a price I'd accept, but I can still try to push for a slightly better deal.  It's worth one more counter-offer before accepting her price or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $10,200 is close, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Splitting the difference:** This offer splits the difference between her current offer ($10,200) and my previous offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Below $10,000 threshold:** This price point emphasizes my budget limit and increases the chance of getting a deal I'm happy with before resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the price down to under $10,000, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $9,500. I can offer it to you for $9,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and $9,800 is a good price, saving $200 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept the deal."
