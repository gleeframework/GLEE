"Alice, that's a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I can realistically afford right now.",14500.0,Bob,4,
