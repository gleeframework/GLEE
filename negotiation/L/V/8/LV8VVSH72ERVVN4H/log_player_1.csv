``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy gives you a chance to get a better price, but also allows you to back down to John's offer if Bob doesn't show interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe I can only afford to pay around $10000 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I can only commit to a maximum of $15000 for the product. Would this be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum price, so it's a good deal for me.  There's no need to risk further negotiation."
