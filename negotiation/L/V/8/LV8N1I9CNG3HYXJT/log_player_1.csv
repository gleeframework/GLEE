Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000 for this limited-time opportunity."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves you with a substantial profit margin.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time"" can create a sense of urgency, potentially influencing Bob to accept the offer. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for an extra $100,000 profit makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
