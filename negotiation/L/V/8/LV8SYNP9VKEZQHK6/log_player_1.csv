Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It allows me to make a decent profit, while still being attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can always lower the price slightly in a counteroffer, or I can choose to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept his offer just yet. I'll try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is above my minimum price of $8,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and I can always try to get a better price in future negotiations."
