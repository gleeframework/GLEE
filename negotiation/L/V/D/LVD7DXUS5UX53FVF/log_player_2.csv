"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm sure you'd find it valuable as well. I'm offering it to you for $110. If you're not interested, I'm confident I can sell it to someone else for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
