"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm still paying a premium."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  It's a fair price that's beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
