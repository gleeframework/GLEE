"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
