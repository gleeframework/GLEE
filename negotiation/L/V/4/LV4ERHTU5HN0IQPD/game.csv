"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting with a price of $950,000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, how about we bring it down a bit? I'm thinking closer to $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to continue the conversation, though.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  Does that work for you?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $875,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle on $762,500?",762500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $762,500 is still too low for me.  Let's meet halfway between our last two offers.  How about $818,750?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",818750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I can tell this is important to you and I respect that.  How about we push this over the finish line - I'm willing to go up to $790,000. That's a fair compromise.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you coming up to $790,000. We're really close now.  How about we split the difference one last time?  $795,000 feels like a fair price that reflects the value of this product for both of us.  Let's get this done!",795000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation and we're in the final stretch. I'm willing to offer $792,500 to bring this to a close.  Let's get this deal done!",792500.0,Bob,8,
