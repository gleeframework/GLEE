"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000.  Even though Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, it's still a good deal for Bob to save $3,000 compared to buying from John."
