Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price in this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting high gives you room to negotiate and signals the product's value.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""benefits"" subtly anchors the price in Bob's mind without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While high, the price is still within Bob's potential acceptance range, allowing him to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have the advantage of a guaranteed sale to John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum."
