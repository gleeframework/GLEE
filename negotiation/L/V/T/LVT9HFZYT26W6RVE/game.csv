"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping for something closer to $14000. This would still be a significant value to you, and it would allow me to fairly compensate for the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13250 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to land at $13750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product. Let's try to close this deal.",13750.0,Alice,5,
