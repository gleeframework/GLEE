"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we've discussed, it's worth $8000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $6500. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $6000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6000. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6800. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing a price of $6100. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Would you be willing to consider my revised counteroffer?",6100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6100. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6400. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",6400.0,Alice,5,
