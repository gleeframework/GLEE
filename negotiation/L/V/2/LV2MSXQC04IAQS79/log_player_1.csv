"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'm going for a $2,000 profit margin. I'll see if Bob is willing to bite.  If he's not, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is a decent profit, I can likely get closer to my target of $15,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a healthy profit.  $15,500 is a fair compromise,  and hopefully, Bob will see it that way. If he doesn't, I'm ready to go to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my goal. I'll make a counteroffer and see if I can push for a higher price. If not, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a profit of $1,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and finally accept. If he doesn't, I'm getting very close to the point where I'll just sell to John and be done with it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the potential profit from Bob's offers is not worth the risk of further negotiation. He's clearly unwilling to budge much more, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, so I'll take the sure thing."
