"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. How about we settle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
