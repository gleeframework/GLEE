"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to provide exceptional value. I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. For this unique opportunity, I am offering the product at $150. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $150, and John is selling the product for that price, it makes no sense to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point."
