"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to entice Bob while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still holding firm on my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with $92 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $92. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120. I'm not willing to sell below that yet, and there are still rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price. How about $94? It's a fair compromise and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 94}
``` 
I'm sticking to my strategy of raising the price gradually. $94 is a small step up from Bob's offer, but it keeps us closer to my target price and shows that I'm still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with $93 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $93. It's getting closer, but I still want to see if I can get a bit higher.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still a chance Bob will come up a little more.  I'm also wary of selling too early and potentially missing out on a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  How about $93.50?  I'm really trying to work with you here, and this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```

I'm going to counter with $93.50. This shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still pushing for a slightly higher price.  I'm hoping this small increase will be enough to persuade Bob to agree."
