Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share this product with me. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $12,000 if I counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
