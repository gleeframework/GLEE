"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also adding a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. It's not worth it for me to accept it. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to find a price we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $65 is low, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. It's worth holding out for a higher offer, and I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's go with $85.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
