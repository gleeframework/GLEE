"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
