Round 2

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $130. This is a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.
