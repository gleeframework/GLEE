"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. What do you say?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to go down to $165. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $125.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's make a deal!",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still below what I can accept.  Let's try $140. It's a reasonable price considering the product's value, and it's closer to your last offer.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $130. This is a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. How about $135?  It's only a small increase from your last offer and still gives you a good deal.  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.",135.0,Alice,7,
