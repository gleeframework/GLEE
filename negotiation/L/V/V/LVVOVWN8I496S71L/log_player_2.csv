"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her product's value to her ($150), you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to buy at your target price."
