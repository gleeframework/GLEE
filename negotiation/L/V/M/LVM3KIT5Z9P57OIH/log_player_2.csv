Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial price. This still allows me to achieve a fair return while potentially making this a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  Rejecting and counteroffering again allows you to try and push for a lower price, possibly closer to your target of $1,000,000."
