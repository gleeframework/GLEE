Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than you might realize. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to instill a sense that Bob might be undervaluing the product.

**Goal:**

The goal is to anchor Bob's perception at a high price.  Even if he rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for a potential counteroffer closer to Alice's desired range rather than Bob's initial valuation."
