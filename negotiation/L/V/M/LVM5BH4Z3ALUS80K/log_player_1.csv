Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves some room for negotiation while still allowing me to make a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive, given his value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  Bob's offer shows he's motivated to buy, and I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still giving me a strong profit.  I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer, given his value of $100 and his previous counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get more than $80, Bob's offer of $82 is getting closer to my minimum threshold. However, I'm not confident I can get a higher price with another counteroffer, and the negotiation is taking longer than expected. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80 to guarantee a sale."
