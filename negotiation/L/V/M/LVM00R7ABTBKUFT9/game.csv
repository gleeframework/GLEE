"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to move forward with the sale.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,075,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is unfortunately not feasible for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to sell and you to get this valuable product at a competitive price.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $975,000. This is a fair offer considering John is willing to sell at $1,000,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",975000.0,Bob,6,
