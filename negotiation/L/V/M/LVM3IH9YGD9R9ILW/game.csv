"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1600000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1520000. Can you consider this price?",1520000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1520000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can do $1680000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1680000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer $1640000. Can you consider this price?",1640000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're getting close, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I can do $1695000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1695000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1695000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer $1650000. Can you consider this price?",1650000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we've been dancing around the price for a while, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final push, and I can do $1700000. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're making a final push, but I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to make one last compromise and offer $1670000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1500000.",1670000.0,Bob,10,
