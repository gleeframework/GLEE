"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to start by offering a price higher than the product's value to me. I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's willingness to pay the full value and potentially get a higher price in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $1,300,000. This is still a significant amount above my minimum, but it's lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I have a few rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $1,250,000. This is only slightly above my minimum, but it demonstrates my willingness to meet him halfway. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal, as we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price. I'm happy to accept this offer as it is my goal to get at least $1,200,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
