```

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob is willing to make a counteroffer.  I'll try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is pushing for a lower price, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable going below my minimum. John has already offered my minimum price, so selling to him is the most secure option.  I'll accept his offer."
