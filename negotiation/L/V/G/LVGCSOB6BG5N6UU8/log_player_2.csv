"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business. I am offering it to you for $950,000. This price reflects its high value and the unique benefits it provides. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price.  He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's a range where both parties can benefit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product. However, I'm looking to invest closer to $850,000. This would still allow you a substantial profit and would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that we both achieve a fair transaction. Therefore, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000 for the product. This still allows for a significant profit margin while providing you with a competitive price. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and looks forward to your feedback.

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still provides a decent profit for her.  Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so accepting this offer is a good way to save money while still getting the product."
