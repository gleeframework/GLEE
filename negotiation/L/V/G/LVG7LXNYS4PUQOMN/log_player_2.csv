"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000 for the product.  I understand it's valuable, but I'm working with a tight budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob starts with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This establishes a clear negotiating stance and leaves room for compromise.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his offer, highlighting his budget constraints. This makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Bob concludes with an open-ended question, inviting Alice to engage in further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $10,000?  That's still a good price for you, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $10,000 is a better price than $11,000, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob can likely convince Alice to come down further by offering a counteroffer closer to her ""true"" value of $8,000. 
* **Avoid Buying from John:** At this point, buying from John for $12,000 would be a worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for me, and you'll still make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob increases his offer incrementally, showing a willingness to compromise but not overpaying.
* **Focus on Fairness:** Bob emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Alice's sense of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Profit Justification:** Bob reminds Alice that she'll still make a profit, addressing a potential concern about accepting a lower price."
