"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $150.  There's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice has come down in price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 125 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for 122.50. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $122.50 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Since this is round 5 and there are only 5 rounds left,  it's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $100 and avoid further negotiations."
