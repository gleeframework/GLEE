"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to show you I'm serious about selling it to you. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still pretty far away from that number.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm firm on $1,000,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal.  It's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
