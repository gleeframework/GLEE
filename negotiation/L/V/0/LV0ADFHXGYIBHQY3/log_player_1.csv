Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95}
