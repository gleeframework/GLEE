"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product has potential but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I see the value, I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we try $1,100,000? That's a significant investment on my end, but I'm willing to make it if we can strike a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
