# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life.

What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. Accepting at $1,125,000 gets me the product for significantly less than John's $1,500,000 price.  It's time to close the deal."
