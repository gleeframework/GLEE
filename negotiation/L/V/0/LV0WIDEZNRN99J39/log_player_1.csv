Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. $105 is still above my minimum, but I'm hoping for something closer to $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $110? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. $108 is better than $105, but I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not quite ready to drop to $108. I'm willing to come down to $112.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 112} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $112. I'm willing to go up to $109, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial offer, I've already been through several rounds of negotiation and Bob seems unwilling to go higher. Accepting his offer of $109 is still a decent profit for me, especially considering I could sell to John for $100."
