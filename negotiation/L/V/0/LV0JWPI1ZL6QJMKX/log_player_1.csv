Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be highly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to offer it at a significant discount. Would you consider purchasing it for $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to aim for the highest possible price. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at $1,100,000 gives him a good deal while still securing a $300,000 profit for me.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to my desired $1,200,000.
* **Alternative Secured:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John at my desired price."
