Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10000, so I'll sell the product to you for $9500.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above his budget of $8,000.  While it's closer than before, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. It's better to secure the product at John's price and avoid potential further haggling that might not lead to a better deal."
