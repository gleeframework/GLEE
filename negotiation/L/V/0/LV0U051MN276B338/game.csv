"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $12,500? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with this product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,500.  This is my final offer, as it's getting close to my minimum price.  Let me know if you're interested.",11500.0,Alice,5,
