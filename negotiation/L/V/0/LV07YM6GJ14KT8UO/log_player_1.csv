``` 

This offer represents a significant discount from my minimum price, but still gives me a good profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I am willing to negotiate, $850,000 is too far off.  I will counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant compromise. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I've already negotiated with Bob and it's clear he's not willing to meet my price expectations.  It's time to move on and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
