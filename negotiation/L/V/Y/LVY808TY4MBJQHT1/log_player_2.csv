"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I am pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is more than fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is polite but direct, clearly stating your desired price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will give you a better understanding of how much Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This product is a real game-changer, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down a bit, $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than your target price and John's offer. You have room to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to move closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness:** Increasing your offer shows Alice you're serious about the purchase but still want a competitive price.
* **Strategic Increase:** The increase is significant enough to signal good faith but still well below both Alice's current offer and John's alternative.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise, encouraging Alice to move closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm ready to close this deal today. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** You've reached your maximum budget and John's offer price.
