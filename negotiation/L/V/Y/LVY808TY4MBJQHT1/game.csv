"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This product is a real game-changer, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I understand the value this represents to your business, so I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. Let's close this deal and start reaping the benefits of this product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm ready to close this deal today. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
