Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could try to push for more, Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate him higher, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
