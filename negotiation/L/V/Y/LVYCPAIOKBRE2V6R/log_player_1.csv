Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  By suggesting she'll list it ""publicly,"" Alice creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or seems hesitant."
