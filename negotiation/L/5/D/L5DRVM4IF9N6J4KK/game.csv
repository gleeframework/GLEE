"Hello Alice! Thanks for offering this product.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $80. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $110? It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair deal to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $105? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,5,
