Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $80. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $110? It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair deal to me."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $105? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $105.  You've been slowly drawing her down, but she's made it clear that's her bottom line. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes no sense to pay more."
