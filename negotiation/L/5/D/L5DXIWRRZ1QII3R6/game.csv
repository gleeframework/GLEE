"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for something I value highly. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,250 just isn't going to cut it for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750, which is a good compromise.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let's make a deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me there, I'd be happy to make a deal.",8500.0,Bob,6,
