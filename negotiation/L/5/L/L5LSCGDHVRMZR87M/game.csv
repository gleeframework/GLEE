"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to you, but we're starting the negotiation at $100. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",100.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we aim for $95? This is still above your proposed price but closer to my initial offer. I hope this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $92.50? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. Considering our previous discussions, how about we aim for $93? This would be a fair compromise between our previous offers.",93.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $90? I'm willing to make a final push to get the deal done, and I think this price is reasonable for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
