"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way above his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price point. He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm already compromising on the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting, he's still over his preferred budget and he has options.  He's only 5 rounds in, he's already shown a willingness to compromise, and he has the backup option of buying from John. He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.  I'm prepared to offer $12,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the compromise we've both made."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's value to me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's already had 6 rounds of negotiation and Alice's offer is still above his preferred budget. He's shown his willingness to negotiate, and he's demonstrated that he's not afraid to walk away.  John is offering a price that's within his budget and allows him to close the deal without any more haggling."
