"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is still a bit above Bob's maximum price.  However, Bob has a chance to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  The option to buy from John is always there as a safety net, so it's worth trying to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand the product's value, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price. "", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not ready to give up on the price just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is just $50,000 above Bob's maximum.  Considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of Alice rejecting further offers, it's a good idea to accept this offer.  Even if Bob could get a slightly lower price, it's not worth risking missing out on the product entirely or having to start over with John."
