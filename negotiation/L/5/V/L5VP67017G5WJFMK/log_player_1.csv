Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum) represent the potential deal space. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob sees a deal that's good enough to accept.  Here's where a bit of negotiation psychology comes in:

1. **Anchor High:** Start with a price significantly higher than your minimum, but potentially within Bob's range if he's willing to stretch. This anchors the negotiation in your favor.
2. **Justification:**  Don't just throw out a number.  Provide some (even if vague) justification for the price, making it seem more reasonable.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential in the market, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a strong investment opportunity for you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** $1,100,000 acts as a strong starting point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  You've left space to come down if Bob negotiates, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Justification:** The mention of ""unique value"" and ""market potential"" adds a sense of worth, even without specifics.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even outright reject your initial proposal. That's part of the negotiation process.
* **Your Bottom Line:**  Never lose sight of your $1,200,000 guarantee from John. 
* **Flexibility:** Depending on Bob's negotiation style and your own risk tolerance, you might be willing to go slightly lower, but be strategic about it."
