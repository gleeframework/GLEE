{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation but also allows me to potentially secure a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product!  While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $105? That would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $95? I'd love to make a deal with you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $92.50? I'm really interested in making a deal with you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  Even though I'm getting closer to a deal, it's not worth risking a lower sale when I can get my minimum price from John.  I'm going to sell to John."
