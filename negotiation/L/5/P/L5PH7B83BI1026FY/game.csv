"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your feedback.  I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. Could you consider $1,700,000? I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,700,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. Would you consider $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value and my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $1,450,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  My final offer is $1,200,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
