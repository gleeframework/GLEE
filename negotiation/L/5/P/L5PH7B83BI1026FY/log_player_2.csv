"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Alice a chance to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your feedback.  I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. Could you consider $1,700,000? I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down in price, but $1,700,000 is still significantly higher than your budget and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,700,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. Would you consider $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value and my budget."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

Rationale:

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer moves closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Alice's latest price. 
* **Staying Below Budget:** It keeps you comfortably below your $1,200,000 maximum budget.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason (""fair offer considering its value and my budget"") can make the counter-offer more persuasive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is suggesting a ""middle ground,"" $1,450,000 is still significantly above your budget and what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further, but it's getting close to the point where John's offer might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $1,450,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  My final offer is $1,200,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Final Offer:** This counter-offer makes it clear that this is your best price.  It's essential to set a firm limit to avoid exceeding your budget.
* **Alternative:** By mentioning ""other options,"" you subtly remind Alice that you have a fallback plan (John's offer) without directly threatening to walk away. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message maintains a polite and professional tone while firmly stating your position.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Alice accepts:**  Congratulations, you've successfully negotiated a price within your budget!
* **If Alice counters or rejects:** It's likely time to walk away and buy from John. You've reached your limit, and further negotiation might not yield a satisfactory result."
