"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start at $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $13,500 from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially negotiate further, Alice's offer is at a price he's willing to pay, and it's less than what John would charge.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would just lead to Alice rejecting his offer again, and then he'd be stuck having to buy from John at a higher price."
