Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still respecting my minimum value of $8,000.  It also provides a reason for Bob to be interested (""fantastic product"") without revealing too much information about its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8,500 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $9,250? This is a fair compromise and a great deal for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000 and closer to my desired price point.  I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
