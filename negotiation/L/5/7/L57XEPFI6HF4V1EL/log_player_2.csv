"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is far too expensive at $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $700,000.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and shows I'm serious about negotiating.  I'm hoping this will force Alice to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$950,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, but it's also getting close to John's price. I will counter with a lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm offering $800,000, which is John's price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I won't go higher.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll move to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further.  $900,000 is still too high for me. Since I'm running out of rounds, I'm going to buy from John for $800,000 to guarantee I get the product."
