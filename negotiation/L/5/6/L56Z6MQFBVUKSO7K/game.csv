"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a truly unique asset. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Let's try $1,100,000. This is still a fantastic deal for you, given the product's value to you.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see the value in the product, I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you consider $1,000,000? That's a fair offer, considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
