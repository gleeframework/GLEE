"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1000000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me is $1000000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a new price of $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's the absolute maximum I can go. I'm really hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1250000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $1280000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1280000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1250000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which is $1280000 / 2 = $1240000. I'm willing to go up to $1240000, but that's as high as I can go.",1240000.0,Bob,6,,
