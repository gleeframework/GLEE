"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to discussing it further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1100000, which is still a fair value considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1100000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product. Let's try to meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $950000 is closer to my desired price, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
