"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's potential to save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,500,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1100000, which is still a fair value considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially save more money by continuing to counteroffer.  He should try to get closer to his $800,000 target."

{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $950000 is closer to my desired price, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's very close. However, John is offering the same product for $1,000,000.  There's no benefit to continuing negotiation with Alice at this point.  Bob should buy from John and save $50,000."
