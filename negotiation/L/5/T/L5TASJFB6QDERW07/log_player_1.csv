"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** I'm framing the offer in terms of the product's value to Bob, which can be a persuasive tactic. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's tempting to sell now, I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  I have 9 more rounds to close a deal and get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John, so there's no need to rush into a deal below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. How about $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to encourage him to see the worth in a higher price.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  My counteroffer is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, giving me room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my target:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and we're nearing the middle ground.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** It's uncertain whether we'll reach a higher price in the remaining rounds, and the risk of losing the deal increases. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting, I secure a decent profit, and the time and effort spent on further negotiation could be better spent on other opportunities.

While I'd ideally like to push for a higher price, the potential benefits of a quick sale outweigh the risk of further negotiation."
