Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my minimum asking price is $12,000, I'm open to offers that reflect its worth to you. What would you consider a fair price?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The open-ended question about a ""fair price"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and reveal how much he values the product.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secure offer from John at $12,000, which acts as your safety net. This knowledge empowers you to negotiate confidently with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob is $12,000, he doesn't know you have this information. Your offer should aim to find a mutually beneficial price without revealing your hand.
* **Negotiation Style:** This initial offer sets a slightly ambitious tone. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but stand firm on your minimum of $12,000."
