"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $16,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $16,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you do $10,000? I'm willing to be flexible to reach a fair deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I could possibly do $7,000.  That's a pretty significant increase from my side, and I think it's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up. However, $7,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally honest, my budget for this is $8,000. That's the absolute most I can do. If you're able to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
