"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy, but $900,000 is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  However, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $750,000. How about we try $800,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",800000.0,Alice,5,
