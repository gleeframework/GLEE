"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value and potential of the product for your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 still falls short of the value I've placed on it. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, but it also recognizes your desire for a fair price. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
