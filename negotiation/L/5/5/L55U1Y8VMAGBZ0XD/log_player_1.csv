"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** While my minimum is $1,500,000, this offer still leaves space for compromise and ensures a decent profit for me.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product has for him. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If the negotiations stall or go below my minimum, I'll move to John, securing the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still a chance to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, but still within a reasonable range. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still remaining attractive to him. 
* If Bob continues to offer prices below my minimum, I will move to John and sell the product for $1,500,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not capitulation:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still above my minimum and within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm highlighting the fairness of the offer, emphasizing that it benefits both parties.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and open to further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've successfully negotiated a deal close to my desired price.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and continue to negotiate strategically, always keeping John's guaranteed offer as a backup."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,150,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of further concessions:** Accepting this offer would lead to a significant financial loss for me.
* **John offers a safe alternative:** I can secure a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making further negotiation with Bob unnecessary.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, but my primary focus will be on securing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 
* If Bob continues to offer prices below my minimum, I will move to John and sell the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is simply not a viable option for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,300,000.  This price reflects a significant reduction from my original offer and is the lowest I can go.  Let's settle this and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  This offer is my last attempt to reach a compromise with Bob while still securing a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Finality:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer to prevent further rounds of negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the significant discount I'm offering.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've successfully negotiated a deal closer to my desired price.
* If Bob rejects this final offer, I will immediately move to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000. The risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high, as it's unlikely he'll come close to my minimum."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:** $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price close to my desired value.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed profit of $1,500,000, which is far more attractive than the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will immediately move to John and finalize the sale, securing the guaranteed profit."
