"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to start our negotiation at a price of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's split the difference and see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be confident that it's worth it. I'm counteroffering at $1400000, which is $100000 below my minimum. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
