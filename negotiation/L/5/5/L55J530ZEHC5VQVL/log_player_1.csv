{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** Highlighting the value of the product to Bob helps him see the potential benefit of the deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to counteroffer if he's not satisfied with the initial price. 
* **Backup plan:** I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product and would be happy to pay $9,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's still interested.  This means there's potential to negotiate further and reach a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **John as a backup:** I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my full asking price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Middle ground:** The message aims to create a sense of compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup plan:**  I'm still aware of my backup option with John, giving me confidence to hold firm if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to finalize the purchase right away. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob's offer shows that he's serious about buying the product.  There's still room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price that's more acceptable to me.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my full asking price, which gives me leverage in this negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range but still acknowledges his willingness to pay more."

```
