"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product and would be happy to pay $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to finalize the purchase right away. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While $10,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500.  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly. Let me know if this works for you!",10500.0,Alice,5,
