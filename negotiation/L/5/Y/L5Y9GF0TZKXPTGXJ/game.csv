"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering my own valuation and the potential for a quick sale. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this final push.  I can come down to $975,000. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to see this deal through with you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable at $975,000.  I'm ready to close the deal right now at $950,000, which is a fair compromise given my budget and the quick sale this offer provides. I'm sure we can both be happy with this outcome. ",950000.0,Bob,6,
