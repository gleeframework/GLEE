Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering my own valuation and the potential for a quick sale. What do you think?

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly rooted at $950,000. While further negotiation might be possible, it's unlikely to yield a significant increase. Accepting Bob's offer means losing out on a potential $250,000. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a much safer and more profitable option at this stage."
