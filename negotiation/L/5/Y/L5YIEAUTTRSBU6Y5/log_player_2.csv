"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$5,000 is a very good price.**  It's significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **However, there's room for negotiation.** Alice might be willing to go lower. 
* **Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to try and get an even better price.** 

By rejecting, you signal that you're interested but are not willing to accept the initial offer. This opens the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's not ridiculously low. It shows you're serious about buying but are also trying to get a good deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will give you a good sense of Alice's flexibility and whether she's willing to negotiate further.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you still have room to increase your offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** $4,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's first offer of $5,000, and it's well within your budget. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is diminishing:** While there's always a chance to get a slightly lower price, Alice has already moved closer to your desired price.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or you might end up paying more by going to John.

By accepting, you secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the product or paying more later."
