Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway, Bob. How about we try $7,375? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,375

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $7,375.  It's not worth the continued back and forth when you have a guaranteed offer for $8,000 from John."
