"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I believe it provides significant value, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You stand to save a significant amount by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
