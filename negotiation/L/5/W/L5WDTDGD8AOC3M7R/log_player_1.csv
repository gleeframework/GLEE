"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate. I'm aiming to maximize my earnings while leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's less than his perceived value, and it's closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on this deal. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
