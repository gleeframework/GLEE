"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for both of them to make a deal that benefits them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a fantastic product that I know you'll be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $13,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has already moved from her initial $14,000 offer. 
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice getting firm on her price or walking away from the deal entirely. 

While a lower price is always desirable, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that is within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
