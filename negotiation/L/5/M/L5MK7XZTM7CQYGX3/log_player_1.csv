""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially saving you substantial resources in the long run.  I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we start the conversation at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting negotiations significantly lower could be perceived as undervaluing the product and leave money on the table.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offered price of $1,350,000 provides a cushion for negotiation.  It allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he can haggle the price down somewhat.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John is a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 allows for a confident negotiation stance. Alice doesn't *need* to go below a certain point. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** It's essential to understand Bob's potential motivations and constraints. Does he have the budget? How important is this product to him?
* **Negotiation Skills:**  This scenario highlights the importance of negotiation tactics. A skilled negotiator can often bridge the gap between buyer and seller valuations."
