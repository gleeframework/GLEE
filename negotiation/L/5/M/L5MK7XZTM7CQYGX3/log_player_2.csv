"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially saving you substantial resources in the long run.  I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we start the conversation at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's a lower price than Alice values the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can get the same product from John for a lower price."
