"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $13,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice likely won't want to lose the sale completely.
* **Exploring better options:**  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore if he can get a better price from Alice or consider buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within Bob's budget:**  $11,500 is still within Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:**  The message highlights Bob's interest in buying but emphasizes his need for a lower price.
* **Opening for compromise:** The offer leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's desired price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, as Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if he can get a better price from Alice without immediately committing to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $12,500. How about we split the difference and go for $12,250? I'm sure we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** Offering $12,250 shows a willingness to compromise while still being closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Positive framing:** Highlighting the potential for agreement helps maintain a cooperative tone.
* **Strategic price point:** $12,250 is halfway between Alice's last offer and Bob's maximum. It's a reasonable price that might be appealing to Alice."
