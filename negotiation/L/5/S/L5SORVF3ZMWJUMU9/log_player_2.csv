"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above my budget of $10,000. I need to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to buy it for $10,000, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my budget. While it's a better price than her initial offer, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I'm going to reject her offer and try to get closer to my $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?  This is a good compromise for us both, and I'm confident it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
