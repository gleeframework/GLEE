"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a relatively high offer, aiming to capture a significant portion of the value gap.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a good portion of the value gap.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I believe I can still get a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm trying to stay above the $1,075,000 mark that Bob offered. I'm getting closer to his price range, but I still want to ensure I'm getting a decent amount of profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my desired profit margin.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a significant loss."
