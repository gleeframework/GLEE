"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth $18,000 to me, and I'm hoping to get close to that.  We have 10 rounds, so there's time to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target of $18,000 by continuing the negotiation. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can use that time to try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $15,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. We have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, so how about $14,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,250. This is a smaller step than the previous round, showing that I'm getting closer to a compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $15,000, but I'm also aware that we're running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $15,000. We have 4 rounds left, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation.  It's possible that Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, especially with only a few rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand your budget, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. How about $14,000? That's only $500 more than your last offer, and it would allow me to make this sale worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with $14,000, which is only a small increase from Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my target. With only 3 rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure to close a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but I was thinking maybe we could meet in the middle at $13750? That's the best I can do, and I'm really interested in making this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're down to the last two rounds, and while I was hoping for a bit higher price, $13,750 is a decent deal considering my minimum is $12,000.  I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk getting nothing at all."
