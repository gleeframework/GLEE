Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It avoids any ambiguity and gets straight to the point.
* **It's friendly and inviting:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum. I can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  I'll try to meet Bob halfway, but not at $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $132 is still below my ideal price, it's very close. Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely, and the potential gain isn't significant enough to justify the risk.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and keeps me above my minimum."
