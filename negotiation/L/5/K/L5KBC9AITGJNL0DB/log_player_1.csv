I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $920,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,000,000,  $920,000 is a good price and a significant improvement over selling to John for $800,000. It's important to recognize the value of a deal and move forward."
