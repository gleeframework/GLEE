Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more for the product, since it's worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $135.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good compromise and a better deal than selling to John."
