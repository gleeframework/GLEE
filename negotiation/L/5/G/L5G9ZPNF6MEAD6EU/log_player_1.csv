Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000). This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob in my message, which could incentivize him to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $10,000 is my ideal price, I'm open to negotiation. This keeps the door open for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer, which means I'm not under pressure to accept any offer below $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product. I can use this opportunity to try and negotiate a higher price. 
* **John as a safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what the product is worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm counteroffering at $9,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a decent profit for me. 
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him that $9,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away the farm. $9,000 is still closer to my minimum acceptable price than his offer.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I can still walk away and sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a ridiculously low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob is getting closer, he's still not willing to meet my needs. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.
* **John as a safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $12,000, so I can afford to be firm and reject Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering $8,500, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his last proposal. This shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value and Fairness:** I again emphasize the value to Bob, and frame $8,500 as a fair price, making it more appealing. 
* **Final Stand:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John for $12,000. This counteroffer is my final attempt to negotiate a sale with Bob."
