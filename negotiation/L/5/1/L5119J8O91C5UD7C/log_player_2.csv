Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $10,250, which would be $10,875. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and the price difference is getting smaller. While you might be able to get the price a little lower, it's risky.  Continuing to negotiate could annoy Alice, and there's no guarantee she'll go much lower. Accepting the $10,875 secures a reasonably good deal."
