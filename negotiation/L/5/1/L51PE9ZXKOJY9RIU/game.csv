"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $850000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to decline. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'm thinking $775000 is a fair price for the product. I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",775000.0,Bob,6,
