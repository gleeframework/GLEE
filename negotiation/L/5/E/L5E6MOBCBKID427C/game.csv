"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $90 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $70? That would be a good compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $70 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and do $80?",80.0,Alice,5,
