"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to him, I'll start with a relatively high price.

{""product_price"": 120}

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject his offer and send a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still reasonable.
