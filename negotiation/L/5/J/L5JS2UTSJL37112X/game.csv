"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,550,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price, considering we're both trying to meet in the middle.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,525,000. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,5,
