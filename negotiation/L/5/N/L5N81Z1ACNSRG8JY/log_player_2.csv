"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, it's still above your target of $150. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's value of $100 and my maximum of $150. This is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$130 is still too high for me, as my goal is to stay under $150. I will continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $115.  This is still below Alice's last offer and closer to my target price of $150.  It shows that I am willing to compromise but still want to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is too high for me.  At this point, I have already made multiple counteroffers and Alice is not budging significantly. It's becoming clear that we might not be able to reach an agreement that meets both our needs. Therefore, it's more efficient for me to buy the product from John for $150, as that is my maximum price threshold and I am guaranteed to obtain the product."
