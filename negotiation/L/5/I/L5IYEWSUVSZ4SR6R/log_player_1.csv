"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $200. I believe it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I think $150 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is his maximum valuation of the product.  There's no room for further negotiation upwards. Accepting his offer would net me less than selling to John. Proceeding to another round is unlikely to result in a better offer from Bob."
