"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  $75 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is unfortunately too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal."
