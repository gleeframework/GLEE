"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1500000 to me, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm hoping to get a deal closer to $1000000.  It's a great product, but my budget is tighter than I initially thought. Would you be willing to consider $1050000?  I'm ready to move forward if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm not ready to give up on the remaining $400000 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a price of $1225000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.
