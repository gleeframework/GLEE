"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than the $8,000 he can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $15,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than the $8,000 he can get from John.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little lower.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us and keeps things moving."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by going down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about $10,500? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice's final offer of $10,500 is still higher than the $8,000 he can get from John. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  It's more efficient and financially sensible for Bob to buy from John at this point."
