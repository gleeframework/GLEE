"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to him, but it still leaves me with a healthy profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has come up slightly, I'm still not willing to accept his offer.  I'm holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering to sell the product for $1,350,000.  This is a slight increase from my last offer, but I'm still open to negotiation. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm not willing to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1280000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,280,000, which is just a little more than Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage him to close the deal.  We're getting close to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems like Bob and I are stuck in a stalemate. While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, it is becoming clear that we are not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I've already reached my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation is not likely to yield a significantly better offer.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not ideal, but it's the best option available at this point."
