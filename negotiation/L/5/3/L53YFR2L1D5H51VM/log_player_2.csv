We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice seems to be stuck on $12,800. It's time to push a little harder to see if there's any flexibility left."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your position, but I'm afraid $12,800 is just too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,400.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 12400
}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($12,100) and her repeated offer of $12,800. It shows you're willing to compromise but also sets a firm boundary.
- **Finality:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're serious. This could prompt Alice to make a decision.
- **Alternative:**  You're getting close to your backup option of John at $15,000. Leaving room for one more potential counteroffer from Alice is still wise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,400 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced it's the best price for me. I can offer you the product for $12,600. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Minimal Savings from Further Negotiation:** Alice has come down slightly, and with only one round left, it's unlikely you'll get a significantly better deal.  
- **Time Cost and Risk:**  Continuing could backfire. Alice might not budge, forcing you to either accept a worse deal or buy from John at the highest price.
- **Acceptable Price:** $12,600 is within your budget and represents a decent saving compared to John's $15,000 price. 

It's time to close the deal and secure the product at a reasonable price."
