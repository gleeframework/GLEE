{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, giving you ample opportunity to counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While John offers a guaranteed deal, it's more expensive than your target and leaves less room for potential savings."
