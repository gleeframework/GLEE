Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely Bob will counter with a price closer to your goal.
* **Gauging Interest:** The $200 offer is high enough to potentially scare Bob off if he's not serious. If he's willing to negotiate after this offer, it means he's genuinely interested. 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you have John as a backup buyer at $150.  There's no pressure to accept an offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $160 is a decent offer, it's still below your initial ask and leaves money on the table.  You started high to create room for negotiation. Bob's counter shows he's willing to go above his perceived value ($120), meaning there's likely room to push for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $160 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appears):** By saying ""meet in the middle,"" you create a sense of compromise even though you're still closer to your initial offer. 
* **Strong Position:** You're still above your minimum ($150) and have John as a backup. This allows you to be firm but fair in your counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal how much Bob is truly willing to pay and if a deal above your minimum is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $180 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $170? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough:** $170 is a solid offer. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($120) and a good profit for you, exceeding your minimum by $20.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above $170.  It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and you risk him walking away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and guarantees the sale."
