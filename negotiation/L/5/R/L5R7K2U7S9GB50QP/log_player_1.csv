Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $110 just yet. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? This is still a great price for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $109? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd ideally like to get closer to $115, Bob's offer of $109 is still a good price, and I'm worried I might lose him altogether if I continue to counteroffer.  It's a better deal than selling to John, so I'll accept his offer."
