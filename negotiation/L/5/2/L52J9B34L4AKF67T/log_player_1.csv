Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, my goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Confident but not Greedy:**  The message aims to convey the product's value and my confidence in it, without seeming overly aggressive or greedy.
 
**Why not start higher?:**

While I could start higher, there's a risk of immediately alienating Bob. By starting at $1,100,000, I'm more likely to keep him engaged in the negotiation."
