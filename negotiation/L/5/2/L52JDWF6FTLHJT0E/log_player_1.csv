Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me as a buyer.  However, I'm looking to pay a bit less than that.  I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still above your value for it, making it a fair deal for both of us.

However, I should also consider the fact that selling the product to John for $800,000 is a viable option, and it's getting close to the point where it might be better to take it. I'll keep that in mind for the next round.
