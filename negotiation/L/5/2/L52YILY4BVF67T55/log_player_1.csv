``` 

I'm starting with a bold offer, aiming for a high price.  It's important to remember I have a guaranteed $800,000 with John, so I can afford to be firm. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth, and it's also below my guaranteed price with John. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
