Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer aims for a middle ground. It's higher than Bob's value of $120, but lower than your guaranteed sale price of $150 to John. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting while still securing a decent profit for you."
