Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unwilling to budge above his maximum valuation of $120, which is our minimum acceptable price.  There's no room for further negotiation. It's best to sell to John and avoid further time investment with Bob."
