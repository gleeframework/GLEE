Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum desired value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and hopefully encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to negotiate down to a certain point, but I'll have a clear threshold. If Bob's counteroffers fall below my threshold, I'll move on to John to ensure I get my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired value.** While it's closer to my threshold, it's not enough to guarantee I'm getting a fair deal.
* **There's still potential for negotiation.** I can counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's, but still lower than my minimum.  This gives me another chance to explore a deal closer to my desired value.

**Strategy:**

* I'll use this opportunity to see if I can get Bob to come closer to my price point. If his next counteroffer is still too low, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering closer:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It also demonstrates that I'm serious about making a deal with him.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, subtly suggesting that $10,500 is still a good price.
* **Seeking middle ground:** I'm framing the negotiation as a collaborative effort to find a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to inch closer to a deal while still protecting my minimum desired value. If Bob's next counteroffer is still too low, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired value.**  At this point, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a satisfactory deal.**  There's a high chance that we'll be stuck in a cycle of counteroffers with minimal progress.
* **Selling to John guarantees my desired profit.**  By selling to John, I can secure the full $15,000 and avoid further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I'm prioritizing certainty and maximizing my profit by selling to John. While a deal with Bob might be possible, it's too risky and time-consuming considering the current offers."
