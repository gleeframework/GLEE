"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $13,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$12,000 is a good price for you, and it's still below your maximum budget.  It's also a reasonable compromise with Alice.  There's no need to risk further negotiation, especially since you have a backup option with John."
