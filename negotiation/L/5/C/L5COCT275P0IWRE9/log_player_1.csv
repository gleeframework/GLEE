{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum desired value of $10,000 but leaves room for potential negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone, highlighting the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum desired value, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
