"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, and I think this price is more reasonable for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
