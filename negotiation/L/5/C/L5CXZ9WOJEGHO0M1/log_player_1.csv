Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies it might be worth even more than Bob's perceived $10,000.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and professional tone keeps the communication positive, even if Bob decides to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  While Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, it's in her best interest to aim higher with Bob. There's always a chance he'll accept the initial offer or a subsequent counter-offer."
