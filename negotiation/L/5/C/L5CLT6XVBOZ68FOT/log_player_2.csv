"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You want to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is the lowest I'm willing to go at this point.

While $90 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate further.  You're willing to pay up to $100, so there's room to push Alice down a bit more."
