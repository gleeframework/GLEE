"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $10,000 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations. Let's aim for a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us. How about we start at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay more than what most would expect. Considering the value of the product to you, let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I propose we meet halfway between our last offers. Therefore, I suggest a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a price closer to his desired $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,750.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I propose we continue to narrow down the gap. My counteroffer is $8,900 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $8,900 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to his target of $8,500 or $8,750.  There are still multiple rounds left, so there's time to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise.  However, $8,900 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, given my budget constraints. I'm willing to go up to $8,800 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also working within my budget.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8800}
