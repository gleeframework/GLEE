Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Not Too High:** While starting high, it's important to keep the offer within a reasonable range.  A price too far above Bob's perceived value ($120) will likely lead to an immediate rejection. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** By phrasing the message with ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
