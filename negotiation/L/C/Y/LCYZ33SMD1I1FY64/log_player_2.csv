"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $80. Considering its true worth and your interest, I propose a special offer of $95 for the product. This is a great opportunity to acquire it at a price slightly above its cost but still a significant savings compared to the market value. I trust this offer will meet your expectations and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is below your maximum budget, you can get a better deal by rejecting it. You know John will sell you the same product for $100.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. Even if she doesn't, you're still willing to buy from John at $100."
