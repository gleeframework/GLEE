"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a price of $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can afford. I'm sticking to my original offer of $10000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,
