Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm asking for $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts.  
    * Bob saves $50,000 compared to its value to him.
    * You earn $150,000 more than selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, the message leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high."
