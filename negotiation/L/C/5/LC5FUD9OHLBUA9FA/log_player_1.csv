{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

This offer allows for potential negotiation while still securing a profit for me. It's also a good starting point as it's closer to my desired price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a certain budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a way to get it for $1,075,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still a good deal for me. It's higher than John's offer, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's time to close this deal."
