Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than your own valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

This price would still give you a significant profit while allowing me to save some money. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.
