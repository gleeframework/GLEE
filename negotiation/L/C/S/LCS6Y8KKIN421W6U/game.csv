"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still above your minimum and I can stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
