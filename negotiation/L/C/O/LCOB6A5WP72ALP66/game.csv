"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To better accommodate your needs while still valuing the product appropriately, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain a reasonable margin for myself. Therefore, I am proposing to sell the product to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
