"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the exclusivity of the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This reflects a fairer price while acknowledging its potential for your business.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to stretch for. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price.  However, I need to be closer to  $1,400,000 for this deal to make sense on my end. This ensures a fair return on the value and potential this product holds.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances our interests.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
