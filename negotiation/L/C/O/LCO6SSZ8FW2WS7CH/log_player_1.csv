Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  This way, I give Bob the opportunity to negotiate, but I'm not leaving any money on the table. If he's serious about buying, he'll have to come up a bit. If not, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for a huge loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  $110 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a good deal for him, but it also allows me to make a profit. If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
