Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I think Bob is likely to find this price acceptable as it's still lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than the price I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer $135, Bob has moved closer to my desired price and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him.  It's also important to note that selling to Bob for $130 is still better than selling to John for $120."
