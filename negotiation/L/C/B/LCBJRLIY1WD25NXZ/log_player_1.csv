{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's valuation, but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate if needed, and leaves open the option of selling to John if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I would like to make you an offer that might be more within your expectations. How about $9500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $9,800?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose $9600 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price and he has stated it's his final offer.  I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John at a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy in this situation."
