"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $130 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $118. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",118.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $118 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm really interested in this product, and this would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
