# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you could try to haggle Alice down further, $13,000 is already a decent price and saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
