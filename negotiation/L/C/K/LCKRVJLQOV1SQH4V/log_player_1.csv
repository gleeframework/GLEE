Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
