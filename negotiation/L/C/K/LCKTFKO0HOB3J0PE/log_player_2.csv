# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $15,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $12,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get closer to his target price."
