Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $120 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without needing to go to another buyer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to make a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. How about $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

I'm still not ready to settle for $130. It's closer to my minimum price, but I think I can squeeze a little more out of Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  Bob has shown that he's not willing to go much higher than $135. I'm not confident I can get a better deal with him, and I'm happy to get $150 from John."
