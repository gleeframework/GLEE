"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I think it's a fair starting point for something that could benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $950,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is a little too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a bit lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate, making rejection and a counteroffer the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price point. However, I believe you'll receive significantly more value from this product, making a higher price worthwhile for you. My final offer is $887,500.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is a significant improvement from her previous offer and is well within Bob's budget. She's also hinting at another buyer, which increases the urgency to make a decision.  Given that there are only 5 rounds left, accepting the offer is the most strategic move.  Bob can still save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
