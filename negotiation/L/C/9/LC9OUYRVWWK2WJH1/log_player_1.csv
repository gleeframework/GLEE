"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $120 to him and $100 to me. I'm aiming for a good profit but also want to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is too low. I can still do better than that. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This is still a good profit for me, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $108. This is my final compromise, as I'm getting closer to my minimum price. If he rejects this, I will sell the product to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to go higher than $104. I'm not willing to go lower than $108. With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth the risk to keep negotiating. It's better to take the sure $100 from John."
