Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to meet you in the middle between $1,175,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,187,500. However, I'm willing to go slightly higher to $1,180,000.

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my bottom line that the risk of him walking away outweighs the potential for a slightly higher return. It's time to close the deal."
