"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money. It's important to be bold and propose a price that's well below what Bob is willing to pay from John, leaving room for negotiation and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than her previous price:** $1,050,000 is better than $1,100,000.
* **The price is close to John's offer:**  Bob could buy from John for $1,000,000, so Alice's offer is only $50,000 more.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  Bob has already made a bold counteroffer and Alice may be unwilling to go lower. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Alice rejecting future offers, resulting in Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.

In this situation, accepting the offer minimizes risk and allows Bob to acquire the product at a price close to his preferred option."
