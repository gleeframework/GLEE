"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
