Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a good amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is still a significant profit for me, while acknowledging that Bob is willing to pay a bit less than my initial offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Plus, I have the option of selling to John if this doesn't work out."
