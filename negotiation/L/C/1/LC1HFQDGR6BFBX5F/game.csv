"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. The product is valuable, but I have a more modest budget in mind. Could we perhaps work something out closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is substantial. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,850,000 is still significantly above what I'm able to spend.  Perhaps a price closer to $1,000,000 would be more realistic? It's a fair offer, reflecting the product's value while working within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. However, I have other interested buyers, and to make this deal worthwhile, I need to be closer to $1,400,000. This reflects the true value of the product and its potential returns for you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,400,000 is simply beyond my current budget. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need you to meet me closer to my limit. Would you consider $1,100,000? This represents a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price. To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,500,000 from another buyer. However, I value our discussions and believe you would be a great fit for this product. If you're willing to come up to $1,300,000, we have a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've made it clear that this product is in high demand, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is still a stretch, I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,150,000.  This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and our mutual desire to close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
