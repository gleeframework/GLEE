"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, given the value you've expressed and the initial offer I made.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
