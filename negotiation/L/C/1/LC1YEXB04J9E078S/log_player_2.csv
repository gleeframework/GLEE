"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above my desired price point. I have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, given the value you've expressed and the initial offer I made. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is within my budget and a significant improvement over her initial offer. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and forcing me to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a good price within my budget."
