"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8800. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. Would you consider $8600? It's closer to my budget and would allow us to finalize this deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8700. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $8700? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value.",8700.0,Alice,5,
