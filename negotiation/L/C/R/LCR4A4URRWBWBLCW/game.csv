"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit too high for me.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a deal, Bob, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $115 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $100. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm not going to sell it to you for $100, that's below my minimum price. Let's be realistic, I need to make a profit.",110.0,Alice,9,
