"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit too high for me.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your target price of $80. It's best to keep negotiating and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a deal, Bob, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down in price, $115 is still too high for you. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $115 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $100. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $110 is still more than you are willing to pay. You're better off continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal. Remember, you have a fallback option with John, so you don't need to rush into accepting a price that's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already made concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm not going to sell it to you for $100, that's below my minimum price. Let's be realistic, I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm on her price of $110, and it's clear she won't budge. It's now the 9th round, and there's only one round left. You've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems unlikely Alice will lower her price further.  Rather than risk running out of rounds, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $80.  This ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with, even if it means missing out on a potentially better deal with Alice."
