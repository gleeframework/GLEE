"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure we can finalize the transaction.",13500.0,Alice,3,
