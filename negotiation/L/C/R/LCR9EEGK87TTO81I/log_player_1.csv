{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure we can finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 13500}
