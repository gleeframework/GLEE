"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to pay no more than $8,000.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for $8,000, but to start the negotiation, he offers a slightly higher price of $8,500. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also that he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for $8,000, but he needs to show Alice he's willing to compromise.  Offering $9,000 is a step closer to Alice's price, but still within Bob's comfort zone. This keeps the negotiation moving and might lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for his target price of $8,000."
