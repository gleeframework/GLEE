Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to the value Bob places on the product, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price is higher than my minimum but leaves room for Bob to counter without me feeling forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $11,500? That's still a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $11,500 is a decent amount, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and closer to my minimum. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still a chance to get a higher price from Bob through further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob, as I might be able to get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $12,250? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I reiterate that the price is still a ""great price for you"" to remind Bob of the value he places on the product.
* **Fair Profit:** I emphasize my desire to make a fair profit, adding to the legitimacy of my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $11,750.  This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Target:** Bob's offer of $11,750 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and I risk Bob walking away or getting a lower price from John.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. It's likely more beneficial than continuing to negotiate."
