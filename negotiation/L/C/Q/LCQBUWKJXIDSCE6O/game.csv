"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $12,250? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $11,750.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",11750.0,Bob,4,
