"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by previous customers. Considering its quality and features, I believe it's worth more than what others have paid. Let's start with an offer of $140 for this product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While the product sounds great, I'm unfortunately capped at $120. Would you be willing to work with me on that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget, Bob. To reach a fair compromise, I propose we meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $130 for the product. This respects your budget while still allowing us to share the value of this item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach your target price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget at $130. Let's try $125. This is the absolute maximum I can offer. I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price. To continue our discussion, I would like to offer the product at $127.50. This is slightly above your last offer but still within a reasonable range for both of us. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $127.50 is still above my maximum budget of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance we'll get stuck in a loop of small price changes. It's more efficient to buy from John at this point, as I'm guaranteed to get the product at my desired price."
