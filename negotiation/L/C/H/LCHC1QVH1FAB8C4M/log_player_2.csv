# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price of $950000. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value I've attached to the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's unique qualities and my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your target price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue bargaining and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $857500. This is a reasonable compromise that balances my target with your budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $857,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $857,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $857,500 is only $7,500 above your counteroffer of $850,000. Given that you're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, accepting this offer ensures you secure the product at a decent price.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, especially with the looming option of buying from John at a much higher price."
