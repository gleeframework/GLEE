"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price of $950000. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see its value.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value I've attached to the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's unique qualities and my investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $857500. This is a reasonable compromise that balances my target with your budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",857500.0,Alice,5,
