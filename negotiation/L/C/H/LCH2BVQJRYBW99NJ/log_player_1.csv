"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob.
* **Fair offer:** While I'm trying to maximize my profit, I'm aiming for a price that Bob might find acceptable, given he values it at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and am willing to pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $100 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding hasty decisions:** Selling to John immediately would secure me $80, but I'm taking a calculated risk to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to consider $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price slightly from $120 to $110.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I'm getting a fair deal.
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, indicating I'm flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited time:**  We're already in round 4, and I want to ensure I don't run out of rounds before reaching a satisfactory price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still a chance to convince Bob to pay closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's offer of $95 and my previous offer of $110. This shows a strong desire to reach a compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal, adding a sense of urgency to motivate Bob.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity."
