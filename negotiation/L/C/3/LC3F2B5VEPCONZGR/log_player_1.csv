Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still making a profit above her minimum ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring Alice makes a good profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to desperately lowball the price to Bob."
