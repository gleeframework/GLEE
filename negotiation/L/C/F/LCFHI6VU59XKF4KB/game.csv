"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that starting price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  While I understand your position, $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $750,000 remains significantly below what I consider fair for this product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, but that's my final offer.  It represents a significant discount on its value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
