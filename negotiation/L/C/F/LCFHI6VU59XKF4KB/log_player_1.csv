Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob is still significantly under the product's value to both of us and my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate him up further, but I'm getting closer to John's offer being the safer option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $750,000 remains significantly below what I consider fair for this product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, but that's my final offer.  It represents a significant discount on its value."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000 to try and get this done today. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

**Reasoning:**  

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $800,000 rather than risk Bob not reaching my minimum acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
