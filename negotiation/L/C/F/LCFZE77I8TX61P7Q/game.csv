"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
