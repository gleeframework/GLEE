Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but not unreasonable, and it gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make Bob more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I need to try to negotiate a better price or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm sure you'll find this product worth that price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with, and I'm confident John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John."
