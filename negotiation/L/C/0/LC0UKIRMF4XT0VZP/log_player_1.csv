Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $1,500,000, so I need to at least get that.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Negotiation space:** There's a $500,000 difference between our valuations.
* **Initial offer:** I'm offering $1,750,000, which is halfway between our valuations. This is a strong initial offer that shows I'm serious about selling but also leaves room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting high and seeing if I can get closer to my ideal price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I won't go below my minimum.
* If negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,750,000. 
* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation space:** There is still room for negotiation. Bob has shown some willingness to compromise.

**Strategy:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. 
* My counteroffer will be closer to my minimum price but still leave some room for negotiation.
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I am serious about maximizing my profit.

**Next move:** I will counteroffer with a price of $1,400,000. This is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer, signaling willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob offered $1,200,000, which is below my minimum.
* **My minimum:** I need to at least get $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation space:** There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise slightly by offering $1,400,000. This is a fair middle ground between my minimum and his last offer. 

**Strategy:**

* By counter-offering, I'm showing that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to settle for a price that's too low. 
* I hope this counteroffer will be accepted by Bob, as it's closer to my minimum price.
* If rejected, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer as my fallback options."
