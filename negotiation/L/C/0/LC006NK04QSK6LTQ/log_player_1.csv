Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it, considering my budget and the fact that I can get a similar product from John for $100.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.
