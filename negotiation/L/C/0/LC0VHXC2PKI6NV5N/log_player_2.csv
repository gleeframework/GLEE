Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a reasonable price."

{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm starting with my maximum budget, as it's the price I'd be willing to pay to John. Hopefully, this will show Alice that I'm serious about buying but also that I won't overpay."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. With only 3 rounds left, I need to be more strategic about my counteroffers."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

I'm making a smaller increase this time, as we're getting closer to the end of negotiations. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not willing to overpay. If she rejects this, I might have to consider buying from John."
