"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we settle around $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,100,000,  I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too far below my desired value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $1,175,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,175,000 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $1,250,000. There are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.

It's a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll gain from the product, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm ready to close this deal soon.  How about $1,185,000?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting close, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I believe I can get a better deal, and we still have a few more rounds to negotiate.  I'm going to make a final counteroffer in the next round."
