# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $700,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is $800,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $670,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm proposing a price of $680,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and the time I've invested in our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $680,000 offer is a good deal and saves me $120,000 compared to buying from John."
