"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $700,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is $800,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $670,000. Would that work for you?",670000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $670,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm proposing a price of $680,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and the time I've invested in our negotiation. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,5,
