Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging, which may make Bob more likely to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired $100. I'll counter with a lower price than my original offer, but higher than Bob's, to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my original price. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm highlighting that this is a fair compromise, and I'm still expressing confidence in the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92.50. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate, and John's offer is significantly lower."
