Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $100,  we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $125 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Ensuring Profit:**  This price guarantees a profit above our minimum ($150) if John buys it, and a decent profit if Bob accepts. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize potential earnings while still offering Bob a price that might be tempting enough to accept."
