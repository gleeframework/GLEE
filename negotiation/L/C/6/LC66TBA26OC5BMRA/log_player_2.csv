"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice's offer is slightly below the product's value to Bob, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping for a price closer to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value I'm placing on the product. I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on it and the value I've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $10,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While Bob could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will reject and the negotiation could drag on.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still staying within a reasonable price range."
