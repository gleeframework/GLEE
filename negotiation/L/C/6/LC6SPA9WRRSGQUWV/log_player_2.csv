"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's below Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $95, which is a good price for the product, considering it's worth $120 to me. I'll accept the offer and save some money."
