{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $950,000 is above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** It's below Bob's value of $1,000,000, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **Room for negotiation:**  It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, allowing you to potentially increase the price further.

By starting with this offer, you establish a strong negotiating position while leaving room for flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than the $950,000 you initially offered. You have room to negotiate further, and rejecting his offer allows you to push for a better price. 

By rejecting his offer, you demonstrate that you are not willing to settle for a low price and that you are confident in the value of your product. This will encourage Bob to reconsider his offer and potentially come closer to your initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm not comfortable going below $900,000. This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be able to get a fair price for my product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer above your minimum:** $900,000 is still above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you profit.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** By lowering your price from $950,000 to $900,000, you show a willingness to compromise, making your counteroffer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Focused on finding a solution:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise, encouraging Bob to consider the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate fairly.

This counteroffer allows you to maintain your negotiating position while signaling your flexibility and encouraging Bob to come closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $900,000, so how about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is not your ideal price, it is still a significant profit for you, exceeding your minimum of $800,000.  

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could risk him walking away completely, leaving you with no sale and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Time is a factor:**  Every round of negotiation takes time, and the longer the process drags on, the more likely it is that Bob will lose interest or find another option.
* **Reasonable profit:**  While $875,000 is less than your initial ask, it's still a good return, and you can focus your energy on other potential deals or opportunities.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or a potential loss."
