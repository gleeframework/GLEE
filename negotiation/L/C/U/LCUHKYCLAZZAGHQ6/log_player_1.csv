"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but below my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and optimistic message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob might persuade him to consider a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us within the remaining rounds. 
* I'll keep the option to sell to John in mind, as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's counteroffer shows interest, there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my target.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting the offer maintains my leverage and positions me to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $13,000 or $14,000. I'll emphasize the product's value and try to bridge the gap.
* I'll continue to monitor the situation and consider selling to John if negotiations with Bob become too difficult or time-consuming."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($11,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value proposition to remind Bob of the product's worth.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  Using phrases like ""find a solution"" and ""works for both of us"" promotes a sense of partnership and encourages Bob to consider a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response.  
* If he accepts, the deal is done!
* If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy. I might consider lowering the price slightly but will also be prepared to make a more aggressive counteroffer or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's crucial to secure a deal. Further negotiations may risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Potential for Future Collaboration:**  Accepting Bob's offer could lead to a potential business relationship in the future, where I might be able to negotiate better terms on future transactions.

**Next Steps:**

*  I will confirm the sale with Bob and finalize the transaction details. 
*  I will keep the option to sell to John in mind for any future opportunities."
