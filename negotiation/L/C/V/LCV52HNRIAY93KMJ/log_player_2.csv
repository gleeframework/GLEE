"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This saves you $2,000.
* **You can always buy from John later.** Even if you accept Alice's offer, you're not obligated to buy from her again in the future. 

It's always best to take advantage of a lower price when it's available."
