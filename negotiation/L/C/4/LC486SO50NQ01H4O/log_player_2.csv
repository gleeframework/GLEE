Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me with a counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and my initial asking price was significantly higher. To be fair to both of us, I could consider $1,350,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her ""final offer"" is still at her absolute bottom line (what the product is worth to her). You won't be able to negotiate her down any further. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes the most financial sense to do so and maximize your savings."
