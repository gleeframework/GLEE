"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I appreciate the offer, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer more reasonable. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",15500.0,Alice,5,
