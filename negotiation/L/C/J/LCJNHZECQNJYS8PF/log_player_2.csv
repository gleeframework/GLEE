"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $17,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $12,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should start by making a bold counteroffer at his maximum price point, $12,000. This establishes his budget and sets a strong starting point for negotiation.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it's a good move to push the negotiation in the right direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still too high. He can still get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to rush into accepting Alice's offer. He should keep negotiating with Alice, trying to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly to $13,000. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while still staying within a comfortable range.  He should aim to find a middle ground between his desired price and Alice's offer, while keeping in mind that he can always go to John for a guaranteed $12,000 deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While $14,500 is closer to his ideal price, it's still a bit too high. He can still get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no need to settle. He should keep negotiating with Alice, aiming to bring the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer again to $13,500.  This shows Alice that he's serious about making a deal and is willing to compromise. Since Alice is still offering more than his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. It's also important to note that he still has the option to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice falls through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is higher than his ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to his alternative of buying from John for $12,000. 

Here's why:

* **He's already saved $1,000** compared to the initial offer.
* **He's getting closer to his desired price.**  
* **He's risking losing the deal.** He might not be able to negotiate a lower price from Alice in the remaining rounds.

It's a good strategy to accept a slightly higher price than ideal if it means securing the product. The risk of continuing to negotiate and losing the deal is higher than the benefit of trying to save an extra $1,000."
