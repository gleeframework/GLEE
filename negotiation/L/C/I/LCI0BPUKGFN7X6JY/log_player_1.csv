{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm not going to sell for that low of a price. I'll try to counter-offer Bob to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is my absolute minimum. If you're still interested, let me know, and we can move forward."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $12,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear that Bob is not willing to go much higher than $12,000.  While I could continue negotiating,  John is offering my minimum price, and I'd rather secure the sale now than risk losing out on both deals."
