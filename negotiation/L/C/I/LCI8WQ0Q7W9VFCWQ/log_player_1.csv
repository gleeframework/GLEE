"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

We're getting close, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a reasonable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on this price, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,080,000 is a good deal. It's significantly more than John's offer and a decent profit above our minimum. Bob is clearly interested and this avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations or him walking away."
