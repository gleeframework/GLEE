"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
