{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $14,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value to Bob. This helps build rapport and increases the chance of a successful negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $14,000 is closer to my desired value of $15,000 than Bob's $12,000.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, we can still negotiate. 
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always go to John and sell for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm currently looking to keep my expenses within $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $15,000.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-offer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still below my floor of $15,000. 
* **Negotiate:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:** This gives me a fallback option if I can't reach a deal with Bob that meets my minimum requirements."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $13,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, acknowledging his budget constraints but still bringing the price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:**  I'm reaffirming my understanding of Bob's situation and reiterating that this price is fair for both parties. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone during the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, hoping to create a sense of urgency and willingness for Bob to negotiate.
* **Setting a limit:** $13,000 is my current limit.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider my other options.
* **Continuing to negotiate:**  I'm still open to negotiating with Bob, as he's a potential buyer with a value for the product.  

This counteroffer allows me to continue negotiating while still maintaining the ability to sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12,500. This still allows me to stay within my financial limits while acknowledging the product's value. Please let me know if this is feasible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to settle. I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, or by selling to John as a backup. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to $13,000.  This allows me to continue exploring a compromise.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm committed to getting a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Maintaining John as an option:**  This gives me a guaranteed option if the negotiation with Bob fails to meet my expectations."
