"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $10,000 is less than $12,000.
* **The product is worth more to you:** You value the product at $12,000, so getting it for $10,000 is a good deal.

It's always advantageous to accept a lower price for a product you want, even if it's slightly higher than the seller's own valuation."
