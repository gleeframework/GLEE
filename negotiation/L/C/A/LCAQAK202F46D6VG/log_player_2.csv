"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you.  I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  My asking price is $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?
