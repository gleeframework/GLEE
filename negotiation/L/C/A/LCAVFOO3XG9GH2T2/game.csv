"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest in something that aligns with my budget. Would you be open to considering $1,000,000? This price would make the product a great addition to my portfolio, and I believe it's a fair value considering our respective interests.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,150,000? This reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects a fair deal for both of us.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,075,000. I believe this price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
