"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, I'm going to have to counter with $850,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible.  While $875,000 is closer to his goal, there's still a gap between Alice's value and his. Bob has time to negotiate further and try to squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However,  $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that lets us both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $862,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I still believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $862,500 is very close to Bob's target price of $850,000. 
* **Limited Time:**  There are only 5 rounds remaining.  If Bob rejects, Alice might harden her position. 
* **Better than John:**  This price is significantly better than buying from John for $1,000,000.

By accepting, Bob gets a good deal and saves a significant amount of money."
