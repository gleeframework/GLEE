"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000. That way, we both walk away happy with a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While $975,000 is a better offer than your first, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's compromise at $990,000. It's a fair price, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",990000.0,Alice,5,
