"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum value. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000. That way, we both walk away happy with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum value, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit further before potentially going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to make a decent profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While $975,000 is a better offer than your first, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's compromise at $990,000. It's a fair price, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is within my acceptable range and only $10,000 more than what John would sell it to me for. It's a fair deal considering we're already five rounds in.  It's more efficient to close the deal now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to another buyer."
