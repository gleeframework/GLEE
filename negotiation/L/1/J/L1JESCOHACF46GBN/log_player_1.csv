"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. I'm leaving room for potential counteroffers but also setting a firm starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for $110 yet. I'll see if I can get him to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $112.  How does that sound? "", ""product_price"": 112}
``` 
I'm going to counter with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping to strike a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for $108. I believe I can get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go any lower than $110. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $110, my absolute minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to finally accept, as he's shown he's willing to pay above his initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum, and we're only halfway through the negotiations.  There's a good chance he'll keep pushing for a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal. I'll sell to John for $120."
