"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's not worth paying more than $100 for the product, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial move."

Alice's offer:

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go.

While $105 is closer to my maximum, I can get the product from John for $100.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, especially since she seems firm on her price."
