Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering it for more than $15,000 guarantees Bob will reject the offer. 
* **Safety Net:** Alice has John as a backup buyer, ensuring she won't be left with the product if Bob declines."
