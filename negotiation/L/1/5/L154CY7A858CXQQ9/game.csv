"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
