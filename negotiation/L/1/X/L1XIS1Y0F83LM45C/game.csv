"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option to acquire a similar product for $800,000.  To make this work for me, I'd need to be at or below that price point. Would you be willing to come down to $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns and the alternative option you mentioned. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
