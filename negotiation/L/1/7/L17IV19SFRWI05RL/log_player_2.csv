Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $875,000 is still below what I need. How about we meet in the middle again at $900,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to closing this deal.  $885,000 is closer, but I need a bit more to make this work. Let's split the difference one more time and go with $895,000.  This ensures a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is Right:**  At $895,000, you're getting the product for well below your $1,200,000 maximum and have negotiated a significant discount.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to go back and forth might irritate Alice. She's clearly shown a willingness to meet in the middle, but there's no guarantee she'll go much lower.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you might be able to squeeze a few more thousand off, the time and effort spent might not be worth the relatively small potential savings."
