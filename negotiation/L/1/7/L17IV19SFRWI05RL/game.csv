"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.2 million to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. My starting offer is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, $925,000 is still a bit too steep. Could you do $875,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $875,000 is still below what I need. How about we meet in the middle again at $900,000? This would give you a great deal on a product worth over $1.2 million to you, and allow me to get a reasonable return on my investment.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal soon. How about $885,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.",885000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to closing this deal.  $885,000 is closer, but I need a bit more to make this work. Let's split the difference one more time and go with $895,000.  This ensures a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",895000.0,Alice,7,
