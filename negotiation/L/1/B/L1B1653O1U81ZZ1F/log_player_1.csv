"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the product is worth $120 to you, starting at $150 leaves room for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to buy the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and you have a backup option with John.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $90 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** You're coming down from your initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The counteroffer of $130 keeps you comfortably above your $120 minimum. 
* **Encouraging Movement:**  You're aiming to encourage Bob to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $100. Can you meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to your price range, and $110 is now above your minimum acceptable price. While you could potentially negotiate for a bit more, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting this offer secures you a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in further rounds."
