"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe I can't justify spending $900000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price? I am willing to pay up to $850000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell the product for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $875000 is a bit too high. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $860000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",860000.0,Bob,4,
