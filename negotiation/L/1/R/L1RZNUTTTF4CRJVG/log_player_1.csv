Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to frame the offer as a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and a counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and hopefully finding a price both Bob and I are happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  While I could accept his offer and secure a sale, I believe there's potential for a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell at this point.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer maintains leverage in the negotiation and shows Bob that I'm not willing to settle for a low price. 

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This price still gives you a great value, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within reason:** I'm offering $110, which is a compromise between my original offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that $110 still gives Bob a ""great value,"" aiming to sway him with the potential benefit.
* **Positive and persuasive tone:** The message uses positive language (""great deal,"" ""fair compromise"") to make the counteroffer more appealing. 
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with a question, leaving the door open for further negotiation if needed. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining my position as a seller who values the product and is not desperate to sell at a low price."
