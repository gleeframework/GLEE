While we haven't reached our ideal price, accepting Bob's offer of $975,000 is the most strategic decision at this point.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's considerably higher than John's offer and still represents a healthy profit margin.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing might lead to a stalemate or even push Bob away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now gives us quicker access to the capital."
