{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $100 as possible, as that's the guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $99 leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight discount, even though it's still very profitable for you. 

**Why not other prices?**

* **$100 or higher:** Bob will definitely reject this, as it's above his valuation. 
* **$80-$90:** While Bob might accept these prices, it leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table. 
 
This offer aims to strike a balance between a price Bob might accept and a price that maximizes your potential earnings."
