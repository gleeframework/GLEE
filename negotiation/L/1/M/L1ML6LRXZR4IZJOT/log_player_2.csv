"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

*  $9,000 is a good price, but there's potential to save even more. 
*  We have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate. 
*  By rejecting, we signal that we're willing to walk away, giving us leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 5.5% discount.
* This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further bargaining. 
*  It's a reasonable starting point, leaving space for Alice to counter without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has matched my counteroffer, demonstrating her willingness to compromise. 
* Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, $500 less than my initial target.
* While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice increasing her price outweighs the potential gain."
