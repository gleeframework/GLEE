"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what it costs us, but we understand its true worth to you. After careful consideration, we propose to sell this exceptional item to you for $14,000. This offer represents a significant saving compared to its market value, while still ensuring a fair return for us. We hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. Please let us know if you require any further information or have questions about the product. We look forward to the possibility of working with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, there's room for negotiation.  You're willing to pay $15,000 (your backup option with John), but it's always good practice to see if you can secure a better deal."
