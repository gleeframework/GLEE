Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $14,000 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down slightly.
* **Strong Alternative:**  We have a solid backup offer from John at $12,000, giving us leverage.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with securing a deal."
