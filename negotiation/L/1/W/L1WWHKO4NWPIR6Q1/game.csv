"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the initial price. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price. I'm thinking along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and I can't compromise too much on it. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its potential.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be realistic about the product's worth. I can go as low as $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, which is my final offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
