You definitely don't want to pay $15,000, and you have a better option with John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better price."

While $12,500 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to your desired price."
