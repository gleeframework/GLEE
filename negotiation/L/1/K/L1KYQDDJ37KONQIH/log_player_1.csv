Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still securing a favorable deal. 
* **Show Confidence:**  A confident opening offer suggests you believe in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Important Note:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.  Alice should be prepared to strategically negotiate and assess when it might be time to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation. Alice should counter-offer with a price closer to her target while still acknowledging Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counter-offer, Bob. It's clear you recognize the value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects both its worth and my willingness to negotiate."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice has come down $100,000 from her initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:**  The counter-offer still keeps the price above Alice's $1,000,000 minimum, aiming for a more profitable outcome.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution, maintaining a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to negotiate, Alice, and I appreciate the revised offer. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is inching closer to Alice's minimum, but it's still below the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  

* **Time Value:** Further negotiation rounds take time and effort. The difference between Bob's current offer and John's is relatively small. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer removes the risk of Bob walking away or further drawn-out negotiations.

It's strategically advantageous for Alice to accept John's offer at this point."
