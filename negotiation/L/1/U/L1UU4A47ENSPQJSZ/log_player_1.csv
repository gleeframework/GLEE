Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you and this is a chance to get it at a great price."",
""product_price"": 14999 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your true value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,999 is a strong starting point. It's just below your guaranteed price and might be tempting enough for Bob to accept, securing you a slightly higher profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  

This approach aims to get you the best possible price while considering your guaranteed alternative."
