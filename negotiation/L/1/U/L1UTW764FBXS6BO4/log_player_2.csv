"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is a fair price that balances my initial offer with your willingness to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has indicated a willingness to meet him halfway. There's still room for a deal that benefits both parties."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1300000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1320000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,320,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Even though they have been negotiating,  it's not likely that Alice will drop her price further.  Bob has already made significant compromises, and it's clear that they won't agree on a price that works for both.  In this situation, it's better for Bob to buy from John, who is willing to sell the product for his maximum budget. This will ensure Bob gets the product while staying within his financial constraints."
