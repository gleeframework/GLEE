Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)"":**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a somewhat reasonable deal.  Going too close to his maximum ($1,200,000) leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for something that can significantly benefit your business."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confidently stating the product's value.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room to negotiate down if needed while still being well above your minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** You're highlighting the benefits to Bob, not just the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. How you respond will depend on his offer and your negotiation skills."
