"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12000 is tempting, I need to be a bit closer to my asking price to make this work.  How about $13000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15000 to you.  Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11500. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to getting this deal done, and I appreciate that. $11500 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's split the difference -  how about $12500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really hoping we can make a deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
