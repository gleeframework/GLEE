Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Urgency and scarcity:**  Mentioning another interested party creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to act quickly.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle above your guaranteed price.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
