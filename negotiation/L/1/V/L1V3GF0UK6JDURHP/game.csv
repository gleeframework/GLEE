"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I'm sure it would be a valuable asset for your business. My asking price is $2,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, so I'm confident it's a fair price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1,750,000.  This still represents a significant discount from the product's true value to me. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
