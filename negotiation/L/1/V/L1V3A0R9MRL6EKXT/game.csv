,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $11,500? That's a good middle ground, and it allows us both to make a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit too far below my value for this product.  Let's try $11,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",11250.0,Alice,5,
