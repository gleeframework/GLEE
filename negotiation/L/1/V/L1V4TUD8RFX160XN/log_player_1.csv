This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges the value to Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum of $800,000, so I cannot accept it. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering both of our needs. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
