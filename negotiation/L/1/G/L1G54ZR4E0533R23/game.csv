"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a bit closer to my target price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $925000. I'll offer it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $925000, so I'll offer $912500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $925000. I'll offer it to you for $917500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",917500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $917500 is the best deal. I'm willing to make one final offer of $910000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000.",910000.0,Bob,8,
