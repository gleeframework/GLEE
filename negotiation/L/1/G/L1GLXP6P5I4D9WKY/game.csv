"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose a price of $500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation and allows for both of us to find a mutually beneficial solution.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. After considering your proposal, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $550,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value I'm getting. I'm going to stick with my offer of $500,000.  This price allows us both to benefit and ensures a fair deal.  Let's see if we can close on this price.",500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $525,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your concerns while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit.",525000.0,Alice,5,
