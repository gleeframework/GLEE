"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $50 is a good price, it's always worth exploring if you can get it even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price.  I'm assuming Alice is willing to negotiate, and this counteroffer will likely trigger further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer.  $45 is a good price, within my budget, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to get a deal. It's better to accept this offer than to keep negotiating and potentially end up with a worse deal, or have to buy from John at a higher price."
