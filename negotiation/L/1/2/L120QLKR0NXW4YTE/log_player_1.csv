Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You hold a strong position. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can aim high with Bob.  There's no need to be desperate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm valuing it at $1,450,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor within the ZOPA.  While it's unlikely Bob will accept this outright, it gives you room to negotiate downwards.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a plan for how low you're willing to go.
* **Relationship Matters:**  Even though you have John as a backup, consider if maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important long-term."
