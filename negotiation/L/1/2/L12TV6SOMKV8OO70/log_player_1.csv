{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you're interested in, for $119. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit. Bob gets a $1 discount (which makes it more enticing than refusing), and you make $19 more than selling to your fallback option, John."
