{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my previous counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures the deal is closed and secures a good price within the remaining rounds. It's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob, and risking a rejection to counteroffer again could jeopardize the sale."
