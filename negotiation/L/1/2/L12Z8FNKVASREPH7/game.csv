"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $110. I was thinking more like $95. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and your last offer?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see what you're getting at, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $105 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $100, and that's my final offer. I'm starting to think about other options if we can't meet here",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $102.5?",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $102.5, but I'm willing to make a final push to meet you in the middle. How about we meet at $101? That's the lowest I'm willing to go",101.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a final push, Bob. However, I'm not sure $101 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $103?",103.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $101, and I'm starting to think that buying from John for $150 might be the better option. Can you meet me at $101 or is this the end of the road?",101.0,Bob,10,
