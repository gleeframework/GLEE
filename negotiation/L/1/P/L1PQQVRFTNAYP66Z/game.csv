"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe this product would be valuable, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price, however, my valuation for this product is significantly higher based on its true worth. I could consider coming down to $900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Perhaps we could agree on $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This offer reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your interest.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you again for working with me. I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. My final offer is $775,000. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,
