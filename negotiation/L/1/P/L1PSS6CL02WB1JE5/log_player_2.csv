"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,650,000.  This price reflects its significant value and potential for your business.  Let me know if you're interested, I'd be happy to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your budget of $1,500,000.  Since you can buy the same product from John for $1,500,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
