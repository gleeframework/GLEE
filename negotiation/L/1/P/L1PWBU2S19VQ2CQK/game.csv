"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique value it offers and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate you coming down, but to be realistic, I can't go higher than $950,000 at this time.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the $950,000 offer doesn't reflect the true market value of this product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, but that's really the absolute limit of what I can justify.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
