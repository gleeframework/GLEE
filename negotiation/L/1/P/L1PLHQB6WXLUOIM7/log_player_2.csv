"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $130 for it. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you stands at $150. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to save some money. Since Alice is willing to sell it to me for $130, which is lower than the $150 I was planning to pay to John, I'll accept the offer.
