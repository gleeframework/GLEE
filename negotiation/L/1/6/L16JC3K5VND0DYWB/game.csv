"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider.  To move things forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the significant value this product offers. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
