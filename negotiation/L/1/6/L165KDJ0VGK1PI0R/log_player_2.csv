It's always good to try to negotiate, especially since you have a backup option with John.  There's no harm in seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?

Alice has come down a little, but it's still above your desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13200. It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really appreciate it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200.

Alice has come down significantly, and while it's still above your ideal price, it's within your budget and a good compromise.  You can always try to negotiate further, but at this point, accepting the offer is a good decision. You're saving $1,800 compared to buying from John."
