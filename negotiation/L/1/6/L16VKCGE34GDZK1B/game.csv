"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $1,550,000 and see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
