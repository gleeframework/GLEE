"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter with a price between his offer and my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping to find a price that's agreeable to both of us.  I'm still confident that the product is worth more, but I want to keep the negotiation going to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's getting risky to keep pushing, as I'm not sure how much higher he's willing to go.  Plus, we're already halfway through the rounds.  I'll take the $875,000 and move on."
