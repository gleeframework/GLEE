Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something truly unique, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  I know that's a significant investment, but I'm sure you'll find it's well worth it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of value.
* **The message:** It focuses on highlighting the value and uniqueness of the product. I'm trying to generate interest and make Bob curious. 

**Strategy:**  By starting high, I can see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always fall back to the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
