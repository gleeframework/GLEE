"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, taking into account the value you place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
