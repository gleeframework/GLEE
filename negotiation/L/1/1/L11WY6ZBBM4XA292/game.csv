,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I was thinking it's worth more than $120. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $125? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to pay a bit more, but I think the product is worth more than $125. I can do $140, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit. I can do $145, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",145.0,Alice,7,
