"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the value it brings.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I expect to get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $950,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
