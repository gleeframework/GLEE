Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.

Alice has gone as low as she likely will. Accepting the $800,000 offer secures the product below its value to me and avoids potentially paying John a higher price."
