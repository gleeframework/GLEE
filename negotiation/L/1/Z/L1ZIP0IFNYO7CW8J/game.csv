"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product is certainly interesting, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree this product has value, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
