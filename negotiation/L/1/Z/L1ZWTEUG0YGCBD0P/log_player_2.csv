# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you are serious about buying but have a limited budget.  It leaves room for negotiation without pushing too hard."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is quite a bit below what I need to let this product go. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about we settle on $16000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it would be fair for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $16,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price in the middle of my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still sticking to my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $12000 is still significantly below what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I can't go any lower than $14000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going up a little from my last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget. This might be my final offer, so I'm hoping Alice will accept."
