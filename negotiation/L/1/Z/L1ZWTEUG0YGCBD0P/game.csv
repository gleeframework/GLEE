"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is quite a bit below what I need to let this product go. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about we settle on $16000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it would be fair for me.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12000? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $12000 is still significantly below what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I can't go any lower than $14000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
