"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $145. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have plenty of rounds to negotiate a better price, and we know we have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a low counteroffer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The tone is important. We want to show Alice we're interested but need a more affordable price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is well below our $120 maximum, but still potentially profitable for Alice if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $130 is closer to our budget, it's still above our ideal price and our fallback option (John).  
* **Alice is Willing to Negotiate:** Alice lowered her price significantly, which shows she's open to finding a deal.  This gives us leverage to negotiate further. 
* **Time is On Our Side:** We have several rounds remaining. It's worth trying to push for a better price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($130) and our previous counteroffer ($100). This is a common negotiation tactic and can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Below Our Limit, Above Her Cost:**  The offer is still below our $120 maximum, ensuring we get a good deal if accepted, and well above her $100 cost, leaving room for her to make a profit.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and avoids any potentially confrontational language. We want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. $115 is still a bit low for me. How about $125? That's a good compromise and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:**  Alice's offer of $125 is just above our maximum price of $120. While it's close, we have a guaranteed option with John.
* **Unlikely to Negotiate Lower:** Alice has consistently moved her price down in smaller increments. It seems unlikely she'll go below $125.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Buying from John guarantees we stay within our budget and don't risk losing the deal by pushing Alice too far.  

Sometimes, the best negotiation is knowing when to walk away and take a good alternative deal."
