"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $975,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations. I'm confident that this is a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Alice,5,
