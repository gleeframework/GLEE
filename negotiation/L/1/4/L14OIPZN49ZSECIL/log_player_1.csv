Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $950,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
