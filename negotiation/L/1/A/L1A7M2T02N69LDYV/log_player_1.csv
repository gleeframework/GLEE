"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it.  $75 is below my minimum threshold, and I still have room to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $85. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith while still getting me closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below what I'd hoped for, it's above my minimum threshold of $80 and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might lose him as a buyer."
