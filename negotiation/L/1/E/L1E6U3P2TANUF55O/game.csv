"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $800000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1750000.

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1750000. I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1400000 to make this worthwhile. Let's compromise at $1450000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1450000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to pay $1325000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
