Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering the product at $14,000, we can gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, we've maximized our profit. If he rejects, we can always fall back on our agreement with John.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher than $12,000, it implies value and confidence in the product, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  We want to avoid losing the sale to John if Bob is willing to pay more than $12,000 but less than $14,000."
