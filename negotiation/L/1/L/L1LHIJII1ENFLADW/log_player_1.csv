Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a perfect fit for your needs and will bring you a lot of value.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer means a $1,500 loss compared to John's offer. It's strategically better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
