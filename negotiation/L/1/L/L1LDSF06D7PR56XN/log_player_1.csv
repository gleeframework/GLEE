Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's better to continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  The product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,200,000 mark.  I'm still optimistic we can reach a deal, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
