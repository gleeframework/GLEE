,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $170 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $140 right now.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and do $155?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $157.50.",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to pulling the trigger, but $157.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $152.50. If we can meet in the middle, I'll take it.",152.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $154.75.",154.75,Alice,7,
