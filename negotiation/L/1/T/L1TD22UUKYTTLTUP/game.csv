"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $9,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price closer to your offer. I would like to propose a price of $10,500. I hope this proposal is acceptable and moves us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. While I understand you're working within your budget, $10,500 still doesn't quite reflect the true value this product holds for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal, and it's important to remember that I have other interested buyers.  Let's close this deal and make it a win-win situation.",11500.0,Alice,5,
