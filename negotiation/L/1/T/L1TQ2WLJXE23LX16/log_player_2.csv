Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. How about we try $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

``` 

Reasoning:  While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  It's a reasonable compromise, saving me $15 off John's price and likely close to the best deal I can get."
