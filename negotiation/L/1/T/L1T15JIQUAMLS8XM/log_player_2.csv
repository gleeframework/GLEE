"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it's a fantastic deal, given its quality and features. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $180 represents the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $160?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as Bob is still interested in the product."
