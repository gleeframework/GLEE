"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with the market value of the product and would be a more reasonable price for me to pay. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I'm not comfortable with $1,300,000. It falls significantly below the value I place on this product. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell for $1,550,000. This would give you a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,500,000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,525,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
