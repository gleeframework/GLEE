Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a higher profit than $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It shows you're serious about selling but also leaves room for compromise.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, and I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer to try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is still a good deal for Bob as it's below his perceived value, and it's closer to my desired price. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement at this point."
