"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $200 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a great deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $100. This product is worth more, and I'm confident you'll find value in it.  How about $140? That's my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet at $140. My budget is strictly $100. Would you consider meeting me halfway or allowing me to purchase the product from John for $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
