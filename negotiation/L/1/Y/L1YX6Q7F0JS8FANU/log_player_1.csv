Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hoping to find a way to make it work within my $100 limit. Would it be possible to lower the price further?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $100. This product is worth more, and I'm confident you'll find value in it.  How about $140? That's my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet at $140. My budget is strictly $100. Would you consider meeting me halfway or allowing me to purchase the product from John for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear Bob is anchored at $100 and unlikely to budge.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
