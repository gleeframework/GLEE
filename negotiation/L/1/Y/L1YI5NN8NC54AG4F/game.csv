"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This still leaves a good profit for you and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $1,250,000? That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is closer to your budget and allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
