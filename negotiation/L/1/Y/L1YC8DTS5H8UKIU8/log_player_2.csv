"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's always worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since you have the option of buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore whether a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It demonstrates that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This aggressive move might make Alice think twice about her pricing and encourage her to counter with a more reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price, but still leaves some room for me to potentially save more. However, the risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might be unwilling to go any lower and I might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's also possible that Alice might get impatient and withdraw the offer altogether. Considering these factors, accepting the offer at $750,000 is the best option as it secures a good deal with minimal risk."
