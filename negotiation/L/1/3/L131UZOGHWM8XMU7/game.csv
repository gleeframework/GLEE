"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to the value I place on the product. How about we aim for $8,000? Thank you for considering my perspective.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I still feel that $9,500 might be slightly above my comfort zone. Could we perhaps aim for $9,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.",9000.0,Bob,4,
