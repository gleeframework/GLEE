"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it for sale at $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a near-optimal outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer acknowledges Bob's potential gain while aiming to secure a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Knowing John offers a baseline helps, but it's too early to settle. We want to see how Bob responds first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's counter-offer confirms he values the product significantly. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a considerable gap between his offer ($1,050,000) and both his perceived value ($1,200,000) and our minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Not Settling Yet:** While John's offer is tempting, it's too early to concede. We have negotiating power and time on our side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to find an agreement, that price point is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer suggests a compromise, aiming for a price point that seems fair given both parties' valuations. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We're not drastically reducing our price, signaling that we value the product and are willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Pressure Through Rounds:** As we progress through the rounds, the pressure increases, potentially motivating Bob to concede further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the middle ground, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,075,000 is a significant profit above our minimum.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are shrinking. Each round increases the risk of Bob walking away or us being forced to accept a lower offer due to time pressure.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now secures a good profit and allows us to move on to other opportunities."
