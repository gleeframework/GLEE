"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is not in my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I've put on the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500.  This would be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000, and it allows me to recoup some of my initial investment. Let's try to close this deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",14000.0,Bob,6,
