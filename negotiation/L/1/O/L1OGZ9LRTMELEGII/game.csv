"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
