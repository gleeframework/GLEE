Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and your goal is to save as much as possible. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer."
