Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is way too high ($12,000) compared to your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject and start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I stay within my limits."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is willing to come down a bit, $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,500. I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but $10,500 is still slightly over my budget. I'm going to try to see if I can get her to come down a little more before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a slightly lower price.  I'm going to offer $10,000, my absolute top limit.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a sale and me to get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your top limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $10,250, it's still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems like she's not going to budge much further.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product at my desired price, I'm going to buy it from John for $10,000."
