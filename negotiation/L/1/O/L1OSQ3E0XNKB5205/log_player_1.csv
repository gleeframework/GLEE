Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you room for negotiation.
    * Still attractive enough compared to your guaranteed sale price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly."
