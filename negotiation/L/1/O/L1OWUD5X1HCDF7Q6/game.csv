"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value you placed on it, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects its worth and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below my desired price point.  I'm confident this product holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000. This price allows for a fair profit for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing us both to benefit. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
