Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000, which is still above my minimum and hopefully appealing enough for Bob to accept. I want to reach a compromise while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better deal with him.  At this point, it's more important to close the deal than to potentially lose a sale and have to deal with John."
