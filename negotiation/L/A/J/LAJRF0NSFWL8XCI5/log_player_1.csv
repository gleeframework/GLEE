Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies high demand (""before I list it publicly"", ""anticipating demand"") to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion (""What are your thoughts?"") which may lead Bob to counter-offer rather than outright reject.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Ideal scenario, you get a great price.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to decrease the price while still staying above your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
