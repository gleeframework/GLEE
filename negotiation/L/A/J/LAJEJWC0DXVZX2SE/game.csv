"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. How about we try to find a compromise at $10,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really want to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $10,900.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,900 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10800.0,Bob,6,
