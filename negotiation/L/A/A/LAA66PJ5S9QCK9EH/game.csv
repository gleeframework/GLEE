"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,3,
