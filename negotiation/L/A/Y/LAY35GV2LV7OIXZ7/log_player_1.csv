Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I want to see if he's genuinely interested in the product and what his perceived value is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $18,000 is closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $19,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price, Bob has come up from his initial counteroffer and we are very close to my initial price. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal entirely. $18,500 is a good price, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
