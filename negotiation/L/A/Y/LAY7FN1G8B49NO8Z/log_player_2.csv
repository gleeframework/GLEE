"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, Bob can potentially get the product for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the product for as close to his $10,000 limit as possible. Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and might be enough to start a serious negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, especially since Alice has already rejected a counteroffer.  The risk of not getting a better deal is outweighed by the potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. $10,750 is a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to Alice's last offer of $11,000 while still remaining below Bob's maximum.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is very close to Bob's limit, he's still not willing to pay that much. Bob has already rejected a higher counteroffer from Alice, and Alice is showing signs of being willing to negotiate further. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better deal, especially with only 5 rounds left.  The potential savings justify the risk of not getting the product right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit but still wants to save as much as possible.  He's incrementally raising his offer, showing Alice his serious interest, and is confident that Alice might accept a price closer to his limit as the rounds are running out. This counteroffer gives Bob a decent chance of securing the product at a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,850 is only $850 above Bob's limit, and with only 3 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and the offer is reasonable, leaving little room for significant further reduction.  Accepting the offer secures the product while still saving a decent amount compared to Alice's initial price and avoids the risk of losing the product entirely."
