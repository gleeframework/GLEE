Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($100) and higher than what Bob considers the product to be worth ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive and friendly tone:**  A friendly message can encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Leaving the door open:** I'm not making the offer a take-it-or-leave-it situation, which might make Bob more likely to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum ($100), it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have room to negotiate further. I can counter with a price closer to $100, which would still be more profitable for me than selling to John. 
* **Potentially higher offer:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay closer to my asking price, especially if he really wants the product.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you understanding my value for the product. I can come down a bit to $105.  This is still a great deal for you considering the quality.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to come up in price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm staying friendly to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $98? Thank you for your time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $98 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of losing a sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I would be left with only the option of selling to John for $100.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer would allow me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation rounds.

While I would prefer to sell for $100, $98 is a decent price considering the risk of losing the sale and the time it would take to continue negotiations."
