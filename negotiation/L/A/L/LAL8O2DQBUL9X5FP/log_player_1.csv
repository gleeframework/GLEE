Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""backup"" price.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, presenting a potential profit margin.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to strike a deal with Bob.

**The Balancing Act**

You need to find a price that's:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  It needs to be significantly less than his $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Profitable for You:** It should be substantially more than your $1,000,000 minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Knowing its value to someone of your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,250,000 is a strong starting point. It's a full $250,000 below Bob's valuation, making it enticing. 
* **Profit Maximization:** You secure a $250,000 profit above your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time"" element adds a touch of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a two-way street. Bob may counter-offer, and you'll need to weigh your options carefully.  Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring a successful sale."
