Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving you significant room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You have a safety net with John ($80), so you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Split the Difference:**  Starting at $120 is a strong initial offer. It's closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still leaving room for you to potentially negotiate down slightly and still make a good profit. 
* **Confidence:** The tone of the message suggests the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
