Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and encouraging him to consider my offer.  If he rejects it, I'll be ready to counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $120 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested.  I can't go as low as $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
