"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we try $1,000,000? This is a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000. However, I'm still not ready to give up on the extra $100,000. How about we meet in the middle again at $950,000? This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
