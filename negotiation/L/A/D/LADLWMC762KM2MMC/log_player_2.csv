"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we try $1,000,000? This is a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000. However, I'm still not ready to give up on the extra $100,000. How about we meet in the middle again at $950,000? This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go substantially lower than $950,000.  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000 and saving the $150,000."
