Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its true value while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $850,000 is still too low considering the product's value to him.  I have time to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low. This product is worth significantly more to you, as you've acknowledged. Let's split the difference.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given your proposal careful consideration. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline at $900,000. I believe we can find a price closer to the intrinsic value of the product. My latest counteroffer is $875,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my target, it's still too low.  I'm willing to push for a little more, but I'm also aware that I need to be strategic.  I'll consider John's offer as a backup, but I want to see if I can close this deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. It's a significant asset, and I'm confident we can find a compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to lower my price to $890,000. This is a fair offer, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not convinced that $890,000 fully captures the value of the product to me. I believe a fair price would be $880,000. I hope this proposal will help us reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running out of time and $880,000 is a good deal, especially considering John's offer of $800,000.  It's time to close this deal."
