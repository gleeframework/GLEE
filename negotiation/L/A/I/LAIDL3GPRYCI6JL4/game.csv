"I'm surprised you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on your offer and explore other options. I'm going to sell the product to John for $800000. It was a pleasure negotiating with you, but I think I've made the best decision for myself.",800000.0,Alice,7,
