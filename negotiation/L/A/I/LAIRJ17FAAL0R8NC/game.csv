"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of the product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's make a deal!",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair price. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,000,000 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  This is a very fair offer, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. ",950000.0,Bob,6,
