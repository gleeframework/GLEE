Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the ideal scenario is to sell for $1,200,000, we are now past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Bob is unlikely to dramatically increase his offer beyond this point. Accepting $950,000 secures a significant profit, even if it falls short of the ideal price."
