{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
