Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $11,500 is higher than the $10,000 Bob is willing to pay, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It's lower than your $12,000 minimum, so you still have some room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a clear offer:** The message is concise and straightforward, and the price is explicitly stated. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below your minimum of $12,000 and even below the price you offered in the previous round.
* **There's no immediate need to sell.** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. It's risky because you might lose Bob as a buyer, but you have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is below what I need, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I'm willing to accept $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my need to get a reasonable return. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** The offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from your previous offer of $11,500.
* **Reasonable price:**  $11,000 is still a profitable price for you and closer to your minimum of $12,000.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the value of the product and your willingness to be flexible. 

This counteroffer maintains your stance while leaving room for negotiation and keeping the possibility of a deal with Bob alive."
