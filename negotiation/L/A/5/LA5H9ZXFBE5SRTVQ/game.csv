"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I see the value in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're really close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000 even?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",12000.0,Alice,5,
