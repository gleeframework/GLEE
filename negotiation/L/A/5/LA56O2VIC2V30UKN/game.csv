,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $120 is closer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. How about $135? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to go up to $125. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
