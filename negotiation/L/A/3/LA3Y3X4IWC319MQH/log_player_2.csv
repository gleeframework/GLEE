Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $6,000 is far from what I'm looking for, I'm open to further discussion. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still offers you a great deal, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $7,250 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation time, so let's try to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has met your maximum price, and there is no reason to continue negotiating.  Accept the offer."
