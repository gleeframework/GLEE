"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $6,000 is far from what I'm looking for, I'm open to further discussion. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still offers you a great deal, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? I think that's a fair price that considers both of our valuations.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $7,250 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation time, so let's try to close this deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
