"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than it does for me. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This allows us both to benefit significantly from this transaction. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.**  You'd save $200,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **While the product might be worth more to you, you're still getting a good deal.** You're paying less than your maximum budget and Alice is getting more than what the product is worth to her."
