"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,025,000? That's a good compromise, and it's the absolute highest I can go.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
