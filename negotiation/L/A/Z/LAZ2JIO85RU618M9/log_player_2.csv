"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product from John for less.  There's no reason to accept at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1400000 is significantly below the product's true value. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and allows us to move forward with this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget, and he can buy the product from John for a lower price.  It's worth seeing if he can get Alice down further before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident that a price of $1,550,000 would be fair for both of us.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for a successful deal. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to meet me halfway. While I value your offer, $1550000 is still below the price point that allows me to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $1575000? This would be a fair compromise, and we could finalize the deal quickly.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for a lower price.  He can also try to negotiate further with Alice, as the deal is getting closer, but he has limited rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective. While $1,575,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,525,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  We're so close, let's see if we can find that final compromise."", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both committed to finding a solution.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once again, but  $1525000 is still a bit too low. Let's bridge the gap with $1550000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget.  Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has come down significantly, but she's still above his budget, and he only has a few rounds left. He can save $50,000 by buying from John, and it's unlikely he can get Alice lower in the remaining rounds."
