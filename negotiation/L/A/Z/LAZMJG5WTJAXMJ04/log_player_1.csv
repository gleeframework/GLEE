"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially finding a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to offer you the product for $100. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $100. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully, he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to consider $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $95 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to offer the product for $98, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $98. I'm hoping that Bob will accept, as it's very close to his last offer.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would have liked to get closer to my minimum price, $97 is a good compromise.  It's within a reasonable range and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to sell to John for a lower price."
