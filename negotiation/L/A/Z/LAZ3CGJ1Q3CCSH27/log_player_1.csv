Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you need to aim higher with Bob to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

By setting the price at $1,400,000, you aim to capture the maximum value from Bob while still securing a significant profit above your minimum."
