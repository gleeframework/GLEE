"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $8,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll pay $8,750? This is a fair price that acknowledges your minimum and stays within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8750}
