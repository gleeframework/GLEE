"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $8,000. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll pay $8,750? This is a fair price that acknowledges your minimum and stays within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
