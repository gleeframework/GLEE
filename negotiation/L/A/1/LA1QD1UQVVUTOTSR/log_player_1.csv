"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a reasonable price for me, but still leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider lowering the price, but I'll try to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a little higher. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a reasonable compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial offer. I hope this is enough to incentivize Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd still prefer to get closer to $14,000, I'm going to accept this offer.  There's a good chance I could get a higher price in future rounds, but there's also the risk that Bob could walk away or that I could lose out on a sale to John. Accepting this offer is the safest and most sensible decision, securing a good price for the product."
