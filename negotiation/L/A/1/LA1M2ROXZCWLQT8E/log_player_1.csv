Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($120) allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $119 creates a sense of urgency and appears like a significant discount compared to an even $120. 

This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
