"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with another price.  $12,500 is closer to my minimum, but I'd like to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000.  I'm coming down a bit from my previous counteroffer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired amount. Hopefully, this shows Bob I'm serious about finding a mutually agreeable solution."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,750 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to accept this offer to close the deal.  There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
