Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm going to try to get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hopefully giving him a good reason to accept while still getting me a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit. I'll accept his offer."
