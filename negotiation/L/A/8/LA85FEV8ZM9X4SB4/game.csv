"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $2000000. I believe the product's unique features and capabilities make it worth every penny. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique features, but I still think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1900000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1700000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1700000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $1800000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,7,
