Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique item with significant potential, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Strategic markup:**  The offer of $1,450,000 represents a roughly 20% markup, which is a significant but potentially appealing profit margin.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the product's ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""value,"" and ""unique"" nature to justify the high price. 

**It's important to note:**  This is just an opening offer. Bob's response will determine your next move. If he rejects it, you have room to negotiate down towards your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
