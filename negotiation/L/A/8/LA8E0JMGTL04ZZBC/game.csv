"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant step closer to your asking price, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your increased offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $990,000. I'm offering you the product for $950,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're both getting closer to an agreement. While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. I'm willing to offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and a strong step towards a mutually beneficial deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $950,000, which is $937,500. I'm offering you the product for $937,500. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",937500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $937,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to offer $912,500. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Let's try to close this deal!",912500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $912,500 and $937,500, which is $925,000. However, I'm also considering the fact that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $925,000, but I need a firm commitment from you to close the deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale.",925000.0,Alice,9,
