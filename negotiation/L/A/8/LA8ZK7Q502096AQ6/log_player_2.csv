"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice:** You pay $140, saving $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  This means you'll have to buy from John for $150, which is less favorable. 

It's always better to accept a deal that saves you money, even if it's just a small amount."
