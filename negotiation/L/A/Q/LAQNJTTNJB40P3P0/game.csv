"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this work. This is a fair price, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a way to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
