"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $800000. It's the absolute maximum I can pay. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still outside my budget. While I understand you need to make a profit, I'm  firm on my offer of $800000.  This is the maximum I can afford. If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
