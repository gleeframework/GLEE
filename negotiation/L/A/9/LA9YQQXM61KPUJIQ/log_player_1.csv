Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, which could make him more likely to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $10,000, I can still lower the price if Bob rejects and makes a counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8000. Would you consider selling the product for $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above his value:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still above what the product is worth to him ($8,000). This means there's room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $12,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer maintains my leverage and shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell.  
* **John as backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me confidence to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer the product for $9,500.  This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum value of $12,000, so it's a good deal for me.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By offering a price lower than my previous offer, I show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not desperate to sell. 
* **Positive framing:** I highlight the benefits of the deal for Bob, making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $9,200 is very close to my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Further negotiation unlikely:**  Given Bob's budget constraints and his willingness to go up to $9,200, it's unlikely I'll be able to get significantly more in further negotiations.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort, and it's possible that we could get stuck in a stalemate. 
* **Guarantee:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guarantee, but it's a lower profit than $9,200. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the best option for a quick and reasonable deal."
