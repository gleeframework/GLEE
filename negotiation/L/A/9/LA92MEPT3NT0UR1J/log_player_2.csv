"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $100 is the best option."
