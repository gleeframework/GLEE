"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the negotiation open for as many rounds as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to accept it just yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still less than my initial offer, it's higher than my minimum threshold and John's offer.  There's a good chance Bob might not increase his offer further, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and ending up with John's lower price."
