"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $10,200? This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,3,
