"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $13,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I can still potentially get a higher price by counteroffering.  I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,750? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,750 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $12,000.  It's important to remember that there's always a risk in continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
