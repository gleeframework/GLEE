"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $860,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $860,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $870,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
