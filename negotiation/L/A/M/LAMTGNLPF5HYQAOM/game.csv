"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that I know will be worth even more to you. This price reflects its true worth and the potential it holds. Let's discuss.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my means.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,012,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal soon. ",1012500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $1,012,500 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, so I'm offering $980,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to stay within my means.",980000.0,Bob,8,
