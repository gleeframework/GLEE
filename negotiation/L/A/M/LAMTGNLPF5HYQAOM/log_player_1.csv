Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price and believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get closer to my desired value in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my desired value, I'm still not at the point where I'm comfortable selling. I believe I can get a better price if I keep negotiating with Bob. There are still 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my means.

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired value. There are still 4 rounds left."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,012,500.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $1,012,500 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, so I'm offering $980,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob, we're still a bit apart.  With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's a safer choice and more aligned with my initial goal."
