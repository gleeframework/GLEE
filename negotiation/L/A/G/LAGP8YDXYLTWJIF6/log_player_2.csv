"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item valued at $1,200,000 by you, at a price that allows us to maintain a fair margin while still providing you with exceptional value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price still provides you with a good profit margin, while allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer you the product for $900,000. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. I look forward to your acceptance of this offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer. While I would still prefer to pay closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000, I believe accepting her offer is the best course of action. 

* **Value:**  I still get a good deal, saving $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk:** Further negotiation could lead to a better price, but it also risks Alice walking away or raising her price again.
* **Time:** Accepting now saves time and effort compared to continued negotiation.

The potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal or ending up paying more in the end."
