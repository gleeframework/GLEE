Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a substantial profit. I'm also aware that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer is at my minimum, I'm not sure I can push for a higher price. John is a reliable buyer, and I'm guaranteed $800,000, which meets my minimum requirement.  There's no point in risking further negotiations and potentially losing out on this sale."
