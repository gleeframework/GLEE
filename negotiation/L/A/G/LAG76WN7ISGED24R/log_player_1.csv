"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, considering its potential benefits. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is attractive to both of us. It's a fair starting point that leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to negotiate to ensure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's important to remember that I'm aiming to maximize my profit and $11,000 is too low. While I can sell to John for $12,000, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price and it's getting closer to my desired price.  Since I only have 6 rounds left, it's better to accept his offer than risk losing a potential buyer and ending up with John's offer of $12,000."
