"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $8,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Would that work for you?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  John offers the product at Bob's maximum price, but it's worth trying to get a slightly better deal from Alice."
