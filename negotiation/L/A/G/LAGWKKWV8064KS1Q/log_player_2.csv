Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer of $10,000.  Cutting our losses and going with John guarantees the best price without further negotiation risk."
