"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a great deal for a fantastic product, and I think it's fair to both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I have a strict budget. I can do $78, but that's my absolute limit.",78.0,Bob,6,
