Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Plan B:**  The offer also serves as a test. If Bob rejects, I can move on to John, who offers my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can likely negotiate a higher price.
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so I don't need to settle for less. 

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but stay above minimum:** I'm lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,500, showing flexibility, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair deal"" for both of us to appeal to his sense of compromise.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm still open to further negotiation if Bob wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $8,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $12,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is more than Bob's current offer and meets my minimum requirement. 

I've decided to sell the product to John to ensure I get my desired profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
