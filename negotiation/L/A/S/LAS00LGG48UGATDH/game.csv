"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $750,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $700,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum. Would you be willing to go up to $725,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close this deal.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. How about splitting the difference at $712,500?  That's a fair compromise and we can both agree on that.",712500.0,Bob,6,
