"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $8,500?  I'm serious about buying, but that's my top limit.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
