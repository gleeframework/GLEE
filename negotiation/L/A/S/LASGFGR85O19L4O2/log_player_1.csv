Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $10,000. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price above Bob's valuation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and suggesting it's a deal, even at the higher price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $8,500?  I'm serious about buying, but that's my top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good offer and above my minimum, Bob stating his top limit gives me valuable information. It suggests there might be a slight margin for negotiation. By rejecting and countering, I can test that limit without risking the sale to John at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm aiming slightly above the midpoint between his offer ($8,500) and my previous asking price ($10,000). This shows flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:**  This common negotiation tactic can make the offer seem more appealing and reasonable to Bob. 

I'm hoping Bob will either accept this compromise or reveal more about his true willingness to pay with his next counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is clearly motivated to buy and has incrementally increased his offer. This suggests he's close to his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could counter again, the potential gains are shrinking. Holding out too long risks frustrating Bob and could lead to him walking away. 
* **Profitable Outcome:** $8,750 is a solid profit margin above my minimum price, and securing the sale now eliminates any uncertainty."
