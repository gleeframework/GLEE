Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high price will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he values the product. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $10,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects your initial price. Listen to his feedback and be willing to adjust your price to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
