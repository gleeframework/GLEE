"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), you establish a strong anchor point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price allows for flexibility in negotiations. You can afford to come down in price during subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price well above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will give you valuable information about Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will help shape your strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.  While selling to John is always an option, it's early in the negotiation with Bob. There's still room to maneuver and potentially reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate by making a $300,000 reduction from your initial price.  However, it's still firmly above Bob's offer, signaling you're not desperate to close at any cost.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By restating the product's value, you aim to nudge Bob away from his potentially low anchor point and justify the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** This offer leaves space for further negotiation in subsequent rounds.  You can gauge Bob's reaction to a price closer to, but still above, your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground. That price is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay.  How about $1,000,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his perceived value of the product. However, you still have a significant gap to bridge to reach your minimum price. While there's a chance Bob could be bluffing about his ""final offer,"" it's too risky to accept at this point. You'll counter, aiming to keep him engaged while moving closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's meet halfway â€“ I can go down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Concession & Urgency):** This offer demonstrates a willingness to move significantly towards Bob's position by proposing a price halfway between your last offer ($1,900,000) and his ($1,000,000). This signals a sense of urgency and a desire to close the deal.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** Emphasizing your significant concession aims to incentivize Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Framing as a Fair Deal:** By presenting the offer as a win-win solution, you aim to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage a positive response. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer still keeps you above your absolute minimum while providing room for further negotiation if necessary in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but are still not quite there. I can do $1,100,000 as my last offer, but that's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Dance:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below your $1,500,000 walk-away point.  He's also introduced another ""final offer,"" which may or may not be genuine. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only four rounds left, it's getting late to concede too much. You need to signal your seriousness about your price floor.
* **Counteroffer Leverage:**  By rejecting and countering, you maintain control of the negotiation's direction. This allows you to guide Bob closer to your desired outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you're coming up, but I need you to understand the significant value this product represents. My final offer is $1,450,000. I'm confident this is more than fair and reflects the potential for growth and success this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer positions you close to your absolute minimum acceptable price, demonstrating your seriousness while still leaving a small margin for potential negotiation. 
* **Finality:** Introducing this as your ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and signals to Bob that you're nearing the end of your concessions.
* **Value Emphasis:** By reiterating the product's value and potential, you aim to justify the price and potentially nudge Bob towards acceptance.
* **Time Pressure:**  With three rounds remaining, this offer places a subtle time constraint on Bob, encouraging a decision without resorting to hardball tactics."
