Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I always have the option to sell to John, securing a deal with Bob above my minimum is preferable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message explicitly states I'm willing to discuss the price, signaling flexibility to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above my minimum, but it's still significantly lower than my initial ask.  There's room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer in the hopes of finding a price point closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be frank, $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $2,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 2100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but not too drastically.  Offering a price near the middle might seem like a fair compromise to Bob.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  This counteroffer keeps the price well above my $1,500,000 minimum and allows room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Direct and Open:** I'm communicating directly about my position while still maintaining a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Limited Upside:**  Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is well above my minimum of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer a price closer to $2,000,000, continuing negotiations risks pushing him away.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to budge much higher. Pushing further could lead to him walking away entirely. 
* **Securing a Good Deal:** It's better to accept a good offer now than risk losing the deal altogether and settling for my minimum with John."
