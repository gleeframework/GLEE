"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be frank, $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
