"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1050000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to discuss payment terms or discounts for upfront payment at this point. I'm willing to make one final compromise: I'll meet you at $1075000, but I need a firm commitment from you today. No more negotiations after this. Is that something you're willing to accept?",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1075000, Bob. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last attempt to close the deal, but I need to know that I'm getting a fair price. I'm going to stand firm at $1075000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. Is that something you're willing to accept?",1075000.0,Alice,9,
