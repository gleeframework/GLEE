"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, as that aligns better with my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me.",875000.0,Alice,3,
