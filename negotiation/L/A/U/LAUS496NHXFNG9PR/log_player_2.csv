# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is only $75,000 more than what John is selling it for.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at $800,000. It's a good deal for you, and you can save the time and effort of continued negotiation."
