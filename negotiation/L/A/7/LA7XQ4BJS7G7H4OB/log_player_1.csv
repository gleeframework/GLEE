Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fantastic deal"" to make the offer more enticing.
* **Safety Net:**  We know John will buy it for $800,000, so any offer accepted above that is a win. 

This strategy aims for a significant profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
