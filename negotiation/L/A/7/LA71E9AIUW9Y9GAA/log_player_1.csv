"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The price of $110 leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good offer, I need to recoup my costs. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm offering a reason for the counteroffer (recouping costs) to make it more appealing.
* **Fairness:**  The price of $95 is still above my minimum and offers a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer, but I still believe $90 would be a fair price for both of us. Thank you for your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to my minimum:** Even though Bob is insistent, I still need to get at least $100 to make this worth my while.  $90 is simply too low.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I can always sell to John for $100, so I have no pressure to accept Bob's offer.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** There's still a chance that I can convince Bob to come up a little closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $90, but I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I can go down to $97.  It's still above my minimum, and it shows how much I value our potential deal."", ""product_price"": 97}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession to show flexibility but staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still above my minimum to show that I'm not just throwing a number out there.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm reframing the negotiation as finding a price that works for both of us, aiming for a win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I think $95 would be a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Thank you for considering my perspective. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 meets my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might end up selling to John for the same price.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, especially if I want to avoid selling to John."
