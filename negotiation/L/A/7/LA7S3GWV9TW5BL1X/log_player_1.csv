Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering its value to you,  I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000 by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $10,500?  It's a good middle ground between our offers, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,800?  It's closer to your value, and it's a fair price for what I'm looking for.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,800 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  $10,000 would be a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  How about $9,900?  It's just a small step closer to my last offer, and I'm confident we can seal the deal at that price.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my target price of $12,000, it's a good deal and a significant improvement over selling to John for $8,000.  Given that we're already in round 6, it's unlikely we'll be able to get much closer to my target price with additional negotiations.  It's better to secure a good deal than risk losing out to John altogether."
