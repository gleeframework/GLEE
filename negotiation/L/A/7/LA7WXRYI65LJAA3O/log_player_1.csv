Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $800,000 (what John is willing to pay)
* **Bob's maximum value:** $1,000,000 
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm aiming for a price close to the middle ground, leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still ensuring a significant profit for myself. 

By offering $950,000, I'm leaving $50,000 on the table for Bob, which is a decent incentive for him to accept."
