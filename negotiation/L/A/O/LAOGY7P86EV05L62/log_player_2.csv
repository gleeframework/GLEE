I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $575,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a bit more flexible than my initial offer. What do you think?

This offer is closer to Bob's target price, and given Alice's willingness to negotiate, it's likely they can't get a significantly better price.  It's a good deal for Bob."
