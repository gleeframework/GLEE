"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $550,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $575,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a bit more flexible than my initial offer. What do you think?",575000.0,Alice,3,
