"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a very good price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, I'm aiming for a figure closer to my initial asking price.  Would you consider $1,000,000? I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still stuck at my maximum budget of $800,000.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  If this is still too low, I might have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase and I respect your budget constraints. Let's make this happen. How about we settle right in the middle at $950,000? This allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
