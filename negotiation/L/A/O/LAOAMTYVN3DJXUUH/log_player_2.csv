# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, I'm aiming for a figure closer to my initial asking price.  Would you consider $1,000,000? I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase and I respect your budget constraints. Let's make this happen. How about we settle right in the middle at $950,000? This allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.

At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John, as his price is within your budget."
