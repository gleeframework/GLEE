Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product,  given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low, and I think we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high. I'm happy to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm confident this deal is beneficial for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $950,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. It's a win-win situation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
