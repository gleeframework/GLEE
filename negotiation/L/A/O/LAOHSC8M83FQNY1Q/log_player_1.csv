"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000, as this is a good starting point to maximize my potential earnings. Bob values the product at $15,000, so he might be willing to negotiate a bit higher. I have 10 rounds to work with, and John's offer of $15,000 serves as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $16,000 is better than John's offer, I still have 8 rounds left and I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my first offer in the next round to see if I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still leaves room for potential profit.  I believe this price is reasonable given Bob's valuation and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  we're now in round 4 and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could result in a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale above my minimum value and provides a reasonable profit."
