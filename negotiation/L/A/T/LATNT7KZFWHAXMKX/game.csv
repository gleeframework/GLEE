,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth significantly more than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. How about we try $13,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting further away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $14,250. How about $13,875? Can you consider that?",13775.0,Bob,6,
