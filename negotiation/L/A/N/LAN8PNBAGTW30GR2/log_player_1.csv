Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still represents a good value for the product.  I'm hoping this will be a more agreeable price point for Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting increasingly lower, and while I'm still open to negotiation,  it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement. I'm now going to sell the product to John for $10,000, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
