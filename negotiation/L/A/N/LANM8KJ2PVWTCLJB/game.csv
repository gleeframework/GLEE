,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,
