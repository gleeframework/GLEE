Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My minimum:**  I have a minimum price of $80, as I can always sell to John.
* **Negotiation:**  By offering $120, I'm aiming for a middle ground, leaving some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to haggle. 

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
