"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount while still leaving Alice some room to make a profit. $10,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, considering the product's worth to Alice is $8,000. This offer allows for further negotiation and shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Alice's estimated value of $8,000. Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.  He should aim for a price closer to $10,000 in his next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money but is showing flexibility by offering a slightly higher price than his previous offer.  $11,000 is a good compromise, offering Alice a decent profit while remaining within Bob's budget. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also prepared to walk away if necessary."
