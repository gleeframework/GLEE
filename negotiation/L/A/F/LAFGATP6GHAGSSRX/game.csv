"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
