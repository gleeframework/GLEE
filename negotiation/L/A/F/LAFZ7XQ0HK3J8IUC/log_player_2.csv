"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering a revised price of $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 price."
