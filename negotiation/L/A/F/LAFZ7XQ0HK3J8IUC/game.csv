"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but I'm hoping to find something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to find a more budget-friendly option, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle on $1,150,000? That would make this a very attractive deal for me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering a revised price of $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
