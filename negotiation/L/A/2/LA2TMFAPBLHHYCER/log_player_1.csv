Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.  
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, bringing you closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Politeness and Professionalism:**  The tone remains professional and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation.

By starting high, you maximize your potential earnings while still allowing for the possibility of a successful deal with Bob."
