Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:** A round number like $15,000 might be met with more resistance. $14,000 sounds less arbitrary and potentially more appealing.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject $14,000 outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
