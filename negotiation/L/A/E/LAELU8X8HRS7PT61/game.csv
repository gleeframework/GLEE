"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's make a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $110.  If we can't agree on that, I'm going to have to go with another option.",110.0,Bob,6,
