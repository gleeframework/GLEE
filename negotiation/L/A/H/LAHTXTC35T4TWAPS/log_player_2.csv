You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  You can likely get a better price than $1,100,000, especially since the product is worth less to you than it is to Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.

You're still closer to your target price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going."
