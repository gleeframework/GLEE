"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for me while still allowing you to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's work together to finalize this agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
