"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary, but hopefully, he'll be willing to pay a bit extra for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my initial asking price, and it's still more than the $80 I'd get from John.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit."
