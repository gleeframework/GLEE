"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to pay less than $130 for the product. Could we perhaps agree on $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. That still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
