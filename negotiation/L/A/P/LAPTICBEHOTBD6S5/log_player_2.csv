"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, a counteroffer of $12,500 is a reasonable starting point. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being a significant saving for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than what Bob would be willing to pay if he was able to get a lower price. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price but still trying to negotiate a better deal.  A counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also giving Bob a better price than John's."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still higher than what he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob one more round to try and negotiate a lower price. If he can't get a better deal in the next round, he'll likely have to accept Alice's offer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of rounds and needs to make a decision soon. This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from the previous round.  Bob is still trying to get the best price, but this offer is close to his maximum. If Alice rejects this, Bob will likely have to choose between accepting her next offer or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price, and they are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price, and further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher offer from Alice. 

Since John is also offering the product at $15,000, Bob is better off buying from John now and avoiding the risk of a potential higher offer from Alice in the next round.  Buying from John guarantees a fair price and a quick transaction."
