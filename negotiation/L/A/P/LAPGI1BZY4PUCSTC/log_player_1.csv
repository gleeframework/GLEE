"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it's a great value for the price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price that's still within the realm of possibility for Bob (given his $800,000 valuation). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially settle for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I can't consider a price higher than $800000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I could sell to John now and get $1,000,000,  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob. There's a good chance I can secure a better price through further negotiation.
* **Setting a Precedent:** Accepting Bob's offer at this point would set a low bar for the rest of the negotiations. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Fair Meeting Point:**  $1,100,000 is a compromise between my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000).
* **Urgency:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other options (John) and emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $1100000 is closer to what I can afford, I still need to stay within my maximum limit of $800000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob is showing some flexibility, we're still quite far apart.
* **Time to Increase Pressure:**  I need to start putting more pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired price. 

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm prepared to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating a firm price but still leaving room for a small negotiation if needed. 
* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

This round is important. If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John as we're getting close to my limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in adjusting your offer, Alice. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Would $1000000 be possible for us to meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 finally meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Gain:** There is no point in rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate. While I could potentially get a slightly higher price in future rounds, the risk of Bob backing out or me needing to sell to John outweighs the potential gain.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a deal and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
