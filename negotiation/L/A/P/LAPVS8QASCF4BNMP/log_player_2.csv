{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the first offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $88, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still trying to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice is coming down in price, it's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get it for your target price of $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $88 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $86.50?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $87.50 is getting very close to your target price of $85.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that you won't get a better price.  Accepting this offer will save you $12.50 compared to buying from John."
