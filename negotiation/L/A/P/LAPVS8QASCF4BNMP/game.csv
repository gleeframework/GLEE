I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90?,90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $88, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny!",88.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $88 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $86.50?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a deal that works for both of us.",86.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",87.5,Alice,5,
