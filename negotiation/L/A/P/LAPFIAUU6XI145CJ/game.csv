"Alice,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. I hope you'll consider this offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
