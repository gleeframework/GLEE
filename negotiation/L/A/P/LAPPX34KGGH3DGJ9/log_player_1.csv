Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price and it's likely I won't get a better offer from him.  I'll accept and sell the product to Bob."
