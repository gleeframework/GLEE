"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. $115 is a bit too high, and there are 9 more rounds to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm happy to pay that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer!  $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 108}
