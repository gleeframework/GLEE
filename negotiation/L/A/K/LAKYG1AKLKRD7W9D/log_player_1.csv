Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why 14,000?**  This price is a compromise:
    * It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him some incentive to buy.
    * It's lower than your guaranteed sale price of $15,000 to John, giving you a chance to make a profit without relying solely on John's offer.

* **Risk/Reward:**  There's a risk Bob rejects the offer. However, the potential reward of $4,000 is worth the risk, especially considering you have a guaranteed $15,000 backup."
