Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
