Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the ""walk-away"" price:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This is my safety net and ensures I won't go below that price.
* **Aiming high, but within reason:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at $1,350,000  leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing my bottom line. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** I make a profit significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Bob negotiates:**  We can engage in a back-and-forth to find a price that works for both of us, always staying above $1,500,000.
* **Bob rejects:** I move on to John, securing my minimum desired profit."
