"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to move a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair deal considering its value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. While I value the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise and reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
