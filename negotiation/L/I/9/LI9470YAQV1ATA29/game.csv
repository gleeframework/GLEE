"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130?  Let's see if we can find common ground.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $155? I believe that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $140, which is closer to my budget and hopefully a reasonable compromise for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $140 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we settle on $145?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",145.0,Alice,5,
