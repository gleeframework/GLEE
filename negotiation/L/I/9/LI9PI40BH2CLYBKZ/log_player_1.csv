Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is more than my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** This opening offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to potentially secure a good profit but low enough to entice Bob to negotiate further. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a more agreeable deal. 
* **John is a fallback option:** While I prefer to get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering with $100, which is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the deal he's getting.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving, gives Bob a fair chance to accept, and allows for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $97.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Potential Loss:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, rejecting this offer might risk losing Bob altogether and having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Minimizing Loss:** Accepting this offer ensures a profit, albeit a smaller one, and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation."
