"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield substantial returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is far above your budget. It makes sense to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product but I can't go above $800,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product significantly exceeds your valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this revised price reflects the true worth and potential returns you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still too high. While she has come down in price,  it's still not within your budget. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential value to both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This product has immense value that extends beyond its immediate price tag.  I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above your budget. It's time to cut your losses and take the sure thing: buying from John for $800,000.  You've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate with Alice and she's not budging much further."
