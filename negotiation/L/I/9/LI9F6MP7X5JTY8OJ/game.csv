"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this unique product,  $1200000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $900000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1050000 is still above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique nature and the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. Considering the value I've already compromised on, I'll make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1025000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's unique nature and value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
