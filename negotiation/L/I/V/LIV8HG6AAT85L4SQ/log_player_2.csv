"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's  worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $15,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made a counteroffer and it was rejected.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiations will be lengthy and uncertain.  To save time and ensure I get the product within my budget, it's best to buy from John for $8,000."
