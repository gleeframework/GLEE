This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my own value. This allows room for negotiation, but still leaves me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."

While $1,050,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for less than that, so I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Since I can sell the product to John for my desired price, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John."
