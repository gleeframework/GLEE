,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you placed on it yourself. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects a degree of compromise while acknowledging the unique benefits this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part and is closer to the value I placed on the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm revising my offer to $1,700,000. This reflects a significant movement on my part, while still recognizing the inherent value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,700,000 is still outside my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This offer shows a sincere attempt to reach an agreement.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
