Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you placed on it yourself. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part and is closer to the value I placed on the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

We're still significantly below John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob up further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm revising my offer to $1,700,000. This reflects a significant movement on my part, while still recognizing the inherent value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,700,000 is still outside my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This offer shows a sincere attempt to reach an agreement.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob is getting very close to our backup offer from John. Accepting $1,400,000 now secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob dropping out in later rounds."
