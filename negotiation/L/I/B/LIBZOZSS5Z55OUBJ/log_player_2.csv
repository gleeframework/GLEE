"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This is a firm offer, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and if that fails, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another option available to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another option, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $950,000 is still within your budget and a good compromise.  It's closer to your maximum limit of $800,000, and it saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal, so you should accept it."
