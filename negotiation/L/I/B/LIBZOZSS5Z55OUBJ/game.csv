"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another option available to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have another option, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
