"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium.  I could consider coming down to $1,650,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,650,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,550,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
