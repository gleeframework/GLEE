Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,650,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,550,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. Let's see if we can push a bit further in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I'd like to push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,575,000 is a strong deal.  It exceeds my minimum and continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns.  It's better to secure a favorable price now than risk the deal falling through."
