"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value to me is $150.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $90. How does that sound?",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a fair price, considering the value I place on it, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
