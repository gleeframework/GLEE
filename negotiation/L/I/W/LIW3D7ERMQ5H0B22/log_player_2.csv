Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's meet in the middle.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,075,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to compromise, but I can't go below $1,090,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's finalize this now and avoid further delays. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $1,090,000 is lower than the $1,200,000 John is asking. 
* **Limited rounds left:**  There are only 5 rounds remaining. Continuing to negotiate could risk running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Slight compromise:** While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer is close enough to his ideal price to make it a reasonable compromise.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product or having to pay more to John."
