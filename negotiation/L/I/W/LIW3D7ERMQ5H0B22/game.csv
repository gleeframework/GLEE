"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,075,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's get this deal done!",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm open to compromise, but I can't go below $1,090,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's finalize this now and avoid further delays.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
