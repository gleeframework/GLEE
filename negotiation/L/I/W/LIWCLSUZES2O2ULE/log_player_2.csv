At this point, Alice seems firm on her price of $10,500.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, it's unlikely to result in a price significantly lower, and it's certainly unlikely to get below John's offer of $12,000. To avoid further haggling and potentially missing out on the product altogether, it's best to buy from John now."
