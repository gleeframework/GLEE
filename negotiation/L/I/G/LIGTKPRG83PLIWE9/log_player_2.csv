Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
