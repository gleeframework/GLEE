You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to show good faith, but still remaining below his maximum budget of $12,000.  This is a compromise offer, trying to bridge the gap between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  It's more efficient for Bob to purchase the product from John at his fixed price of $12,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
