Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $12,000 is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $12,000 is below your minimum of $15,000, leaving you room to negotiate if needed. 
* **It's positive and encouraging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product, making Bob more likely to engage.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to be flexible and willing to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I understand it's a significant investment, but this product truly has the potential to deliver a much higher return for you.

Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Bob's offer:
