"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than his maximum budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I understand it's a significant investment, but this product truly has the potential to deliver a much higher return for you. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise and allows me to at least partially cover my own costs.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise and allows us to both make a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate.  $9,500 is still within his budget and closer to Alice's last offer, increasing the chances of a deal. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, making it more likely Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to go higher, $9,500 still doesn't quite work for me. Considering the value this product holds and the potential benefits for you, I'm prepared to offer it for $10,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a profitable deal. Let's finalize this agreement and make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better offer than before, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks a stalemate or further lowering of Alice's offer, potentially exceeding Bob's budget.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price."
