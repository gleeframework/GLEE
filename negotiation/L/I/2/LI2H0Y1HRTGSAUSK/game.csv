"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a game-changer in its industry and I think you'll be impressed. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential returns. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $500000 for it.  This is a fair starting point given my budget and the need for further evaluation.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the potential returns and the industry standards. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $650000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  I'm willing to go up to $575000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to find a price that benefits both of us.",575000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's potential returns. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $600000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $590000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",590000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $595000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",595000.0,Alice,7,
