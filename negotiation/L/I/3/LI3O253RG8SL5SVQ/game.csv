"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a significant discount considering its true value, but I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $15000 is at the upper end of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see it at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it,  reflecting my current budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is certainly a fair offer,  I'm looking for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's unique value and potential. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $12500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.",12500.0,Alice,3,
