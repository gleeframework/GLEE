"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
