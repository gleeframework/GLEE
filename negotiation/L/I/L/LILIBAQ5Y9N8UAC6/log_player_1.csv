Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $130 is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Bob:**  By mentioning Bob's potential benefit, I'm trying to pique his interest and make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I haven't gone too high with my initial offer because I want to keep John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my starting price and is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to $120, which might be acceptable to Bob while still being profitable for me.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and show him that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.  

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to make this work.  How about $115? That's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of this."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  $115 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a reasonable profit. It's closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely to be accepted.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get,  further encouraging him to consider my offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While this counteroffer is closer to Bob's, it's still higher than his initial offer, showing that I'm not giving in easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $150.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Bob won't budge. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a longer negotiation process, potentially leading to a lost sale.
* **John's Offer:**  John is a guaranteed sale at a much higher price ($150). It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a secure buyer at a significantly better price. 

**Conclusion:** Selling to John is the most profitable and efficient option in this situation."
