"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I understand the product is valuable, but I'm only willing to go as high as $900,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me, while still giving you a substantial profit. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm proposing a new price of $1,025,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This price is fair and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,8,
