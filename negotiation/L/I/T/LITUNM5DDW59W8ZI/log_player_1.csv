"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good deal, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm reducing my price again, but only slightly.  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my belief that the product is worth more than $875,000."
