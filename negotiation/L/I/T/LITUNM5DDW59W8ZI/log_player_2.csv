"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $950,000 is still a significant chunk of change. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You haven't even made a counteroffer yet, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You only want to buy from John if you can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:** I'm offering $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like she's being pushed too hard. 
* **Show intent to buy:** This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above what I'm willing to pay right now.
* **I'm willing to continue negotiating.** There's still some room to get the price down further. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** I'm determined to get the best possible deal, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase the offer slightly:** I'm increasing my offer to $875,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Stay below Alice's offer:** This offer is still below Alice's counteroffer, but it's getting closer to her desired price. 
* **Test the waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is and if there's a middle ground we can reach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to my desired price.**  Her offer of $890,000 is now within a range that I'm comfortable with. 
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.** There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, Alice will counter with a higher price, and I might end up paying more.
* **John's offer is still a fallback option.** If I can't reach a deal with Alice, I can always buy from John, but I'm trying to avoid that. 

By accepting this offer, I'm able to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John while also getting a product that I want."
