"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $102? It's a steal for this product!"", ""product_price"": 102}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $102 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $100."
