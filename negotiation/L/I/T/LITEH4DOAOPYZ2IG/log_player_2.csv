# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you first. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, and Alice is willing to sell for $10,000. There's no reason to pay more than that."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still willing to pay $10,000, and there's no reason to move closer to her asking price yet.  He can counteroffer again and see if Alice is willing to budge."
