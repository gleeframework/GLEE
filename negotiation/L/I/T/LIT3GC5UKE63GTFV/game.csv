"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $22,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you do $18,000? That would be a significant step towards a deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still out of my range. Let's meet in the middle. How about $15,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
