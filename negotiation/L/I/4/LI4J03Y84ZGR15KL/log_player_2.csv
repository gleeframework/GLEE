"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$8,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I believe there's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows me to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly towards my initial counteroffer.  I'm going to increase my counteroffer by $1,000 to $7,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $7,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to negotiate or that we might run out of rounds before reaching a deal.  At this point, $7,200 is a good price, and accepting it is a safe bet to secure the product within my budget."
