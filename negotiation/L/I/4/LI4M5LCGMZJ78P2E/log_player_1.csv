Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob without him rejecting the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John.

Offering the product at $140 creates a potential $40 profit margin while still being an attractive deal for Bob (saving him $60 compared to his perceived value)."
