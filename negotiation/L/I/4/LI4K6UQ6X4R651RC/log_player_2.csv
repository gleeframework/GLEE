"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price, potentially closer to Alice's $10,000 valuation.  This could lead to a better deal than accepting Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $11,000? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000, and it's within Bob's budget.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
