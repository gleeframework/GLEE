Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter-offer again. 
* I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I still have room for negotiation.  $90 is still below my minimum, and John is willing to pay $100.  I'll counter-offer Bob, aiming for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's still above Bob's offer but closer to my target price.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value to Bob. 
* **Sense of urgency:** I'm suggesting we ""make this happen"" to motivate Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter-offer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit too high. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could continue negotiating, John is willing to pay my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John to ensure I meet my minimum goal."
