You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is $12,000. 
* It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price, as you have 9 more rounds to do so. 
* Buying from John immediately would cost you more than negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice values the product at $10,000. 
* This offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and gives her some room to negotiate. 
* It's also below your maximum price point, leaving space for potential counteroffers."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is slightly higher than her initial offer, but still lower than your maximum price.
* It's likely that Alice is willing to negotiate further, especially since you've already demonstrated you're willing to walk away. 
* You still have several rounds left, giving you more leverage to push for a lower price. Buying from John at this point would be a worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is likely testing the waters with her slightly higher counteroffer. 
* We're increasing our offer slightly, showing flexibility but staying under our maximum.
* This counteroffer puts the price closer to Alice's desired price while still giving us a good deal.
* We still have several rounds left, allowing us to negotiate further if necessary."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum, but it's still within a range where you can likely negotiate a better price. 
*  You still have several rounds left, providing opportunities to push for a lower price and potentially secure a better deal than buying from John.
*  Rejecting this offer signals to Alice that you're serious about finding a price that works for you, which could lead to more concessions from her in the next rounds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're increasing our offer again, showing continued willingness to negotiate. 
* This offer is closer to Alice's last offer, but still significantly lower than her initial price and within your maximum price.
* This counteroffer could prompt Alice to reconsider and make a more attractive offer. 
* It also allows for further negotiation in the remaining rounds, giving you a better chance of securing a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's still not a deal that you're happy with.
* You still have a few rounds left, and it's worth pushing for a lower price. 
*  The difference between her offer and your maximum price is shrinking, so a counteroffer could potentially lead to a more favorable deal. 
* Buying from John right now would be more expensive than continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice is pushing harder, but we're still under our maximum. 
* This counteroffer signals that we're serious about getting a deal, but we're not willing to pay her full asking price.
* With only two rounds left, this might be our final attempt at a lower price before considering John's offer. 
*  We're pushing for a price that's closer to her valuation but still leaves some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now very close to your maximum price. 
* With only one round remaining, the chances of negotiating a lower price are slim. 
* Buying from John at $15,000 guarantees you get the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a worse deal.
* It's better to secure the product at your maximum price than risk losing it and potentially having to pay even more in a future round."
