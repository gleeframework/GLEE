{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to make Bob feel valued and more likely to engage.
* **Leaving room for Counteroffers:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow us to find a price we're both happy with.
* **Knowing my Alternative:** I have John as a backup buyer for $15,000, which gives me a strong negotiating position. If Bob doesn't come close to my minimum price, I can walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Lower than My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob is clearly interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate.  This suggests that a higher price is still possible.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer now allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price of $14,000.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, keeping in mind Bob's counteroffer and my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $13,000 is a good offer, it's just a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $13,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning and Justification:** I'm explaining my rationale for the counteroffer, emphasizing fairness and a good price for both of us.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** I'm staying above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring that I'm getting a fair deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. Let's meet in the middle at $13,250. I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is very close to my minimum price of $15,000. This means that further negotiation is unlikely to significantly increase the price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By continuing to negotiate with Bob, I risk losing valuable time and potentially missing out on a sale to John at a higher price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is a good outcome considering my minimum price.

**Conclusion:** It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
