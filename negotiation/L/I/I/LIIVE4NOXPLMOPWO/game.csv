"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $13,000 is a good offer, it's just a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. Let's meet in the middle at $13,250. I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13250.0,Bob,4,
