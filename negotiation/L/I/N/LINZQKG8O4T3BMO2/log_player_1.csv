Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  While a simple ""take it or leave it"" approach is possible, providing a reason (even if generic) can make Bob feel like the price is justified.
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and how much you know about Bob, you might choose a different approach."
