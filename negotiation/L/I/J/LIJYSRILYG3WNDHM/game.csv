,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm prepared to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're committed to your price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's meet in the middle!",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's split the difference at $10,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on a higher price. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, and I'll sell it to you for $11,250. It's still a great value for you, and I'll make sure you're happy with the extras I'll include.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to include extras, but  $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,750.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal!",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",11000.0,Alice,9,
