# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $12,000. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to pay no more than $15,000, and her offer is already above your maximum.
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.**  By rejecting, you can start negotiating and potentially get a lower price. 
* **There's time to negotiate.** You have 10 rounds, so there's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't benefit you."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm prepared to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness in negotiating.

* **Room for compromise:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you have more rounds to adjust your counteroffer and find a price that works for both parties."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on a higher price. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, and I'll sell it to you for $11,250. It's still a great value for you, and I'll make sure you're happy with the extras I'll include.

* **You're close to a deal:**  You're only $750 apart, and with the extra rounds, it's likely you can get a better price.
* **The ""extras"" are likely not worth the price difference:**  While the extras sound appealing, it's important to focus on the core value of the product and whether it's worth the additional cost."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
