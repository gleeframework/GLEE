"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you offering the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too high. I'm happy to go up to $9,500.  That's a fair compromise, and it's still within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  To be honest, I have another offer for $12,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",10000.0,Bob,6,
