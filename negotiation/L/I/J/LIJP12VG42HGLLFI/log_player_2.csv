"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save money, so rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to start."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to save as much money as possible. You can likely get the price lower, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}
