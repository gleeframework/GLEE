The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, but she's offering it for $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before going to John."

Alice has lowered her price to $950,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'll try one more counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
