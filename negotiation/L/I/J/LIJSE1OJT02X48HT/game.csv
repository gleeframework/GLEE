"Hello Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first, before exploring other options.

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value it could bring to my business.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $500000 is unfortunately too far below the value I've assessed for this unique offering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $750000 would be the absolute minimum I can accept. This price still reflects the product's potential and the significant benefit it could bring to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $625000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product.",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product and I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $625000 is closer but still falls short of my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $700000 to demonstrate my commitment to a deal. This price reflects the unique value of the product and provides both of us with a solid return on investment. Let's try to close this deal.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your commitment to the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $675000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product.",675000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and we're getting closer to a deal.  $675000 is still a bit below my minimum value, but I'm willing to compromise one last time.  I'll offer $687500.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and it's crucial for me to get as close as possible to the product's true value.  Let's try to finalize this agreement.",687500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $687500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer of $670000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",670000.0,Bob,8,
