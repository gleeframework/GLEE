``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This gives him a good deal ($200,000 in savings), while still netting me a significant profit. I'm confident that Bob will find this offer appealing, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profitable outcome."
