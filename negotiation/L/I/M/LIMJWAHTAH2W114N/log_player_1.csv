Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:**  $1,400,000 is more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him a reason to negotiate. 
* **It shows confidence:**  A bold initial offer can sometimes lead to a better outcome. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also keep in mind that a successful negotiation might involve giving a bit to get a bit more in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth pushing for a bit more. You have leverage since the product is worth more to him than to you. Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,200,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price:

* **Lower than your initial offer:** This shows flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This demonstrates that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Reasoned Justification:**  The message provides a logical reason for the price, focusing on value and satisfaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and only $50,000 less than your last offer.  At this point, it's unlikely you'll get a better price from Bob.  There's a risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or a lower offer.  Accepting this offer secures a good price while minimizing the chance of a worse outcome."
