Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price gradually, but I'm not going to give it away for less than $800,000. I have John as a backup if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

$700,000 is too low for me. I'm not desperate to sell, and John is still a viable option at $800,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my original offer, but it's still a good amount of money for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to consider. If he rejects again, I'll need to reassess whether to move closer to John's offer or risk losing him altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is dropping his offers considerably. I'm not willing to go lower than $800,000, and I'm concerned that he may not be willing to come up.  It's time to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale."
