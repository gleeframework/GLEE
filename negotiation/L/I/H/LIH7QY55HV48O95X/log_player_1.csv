Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in paying $120 for it?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120 is a fair price:** It's higher than what I would get from John, but significantly lower than the product's value to Bob. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **The message is friendly and persuasive:** It emphasizes the value of the product to both of us, making it more appealing to Bob."
