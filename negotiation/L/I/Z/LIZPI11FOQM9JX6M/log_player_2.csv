"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to your endeavors. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,200,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worth accepting this offer as it's too expensive.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  While that number is lower than I'd like, I want to see if we can find a solution. How about we meet at $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Rejecting this offer will allow me to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is getting close, but I need to be closer to $1,650,000 to make this work on my end.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,650,000 is still above my budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that we're not going to find a mutually agreeable price.  Given the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's the most financially responsible decision. I'm getting the product for a price within my budget and avoiding further negotiation."
