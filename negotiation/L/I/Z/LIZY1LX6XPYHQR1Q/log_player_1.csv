Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", ""product_price"": 2250000} 

My strategy here is to start with a strong initial offer significantly above both our valuations. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. I knew my initial offer would likely be rejected, but this gives us a starting point for negotiation.  I'll counter at a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,250,000 is my starting point, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  I believe this product offers significant value, and this price reflects that while acknowledging your budget considerations."", ""product_price"": 1850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This would allow you to make a good profit and would be a good deal for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially push for more, accepting his offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer altogether."
