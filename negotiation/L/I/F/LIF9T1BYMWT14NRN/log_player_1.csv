{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), but it's still a substantial profit for me. This strategy is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob is truly interested, he's likely to counter-offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By starting lower, I have room to increase the price if needed.
* **Maintain pressure:** I'm making it clear that I'm willing to sell to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  Rejecting allows me to counter-offer and see if I can push closer to my goal of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to:

* **Signal flexibility:** It shows Bob I'm open to negotiating and willing to adjust my price.
* **Maintain a profit:** $1,350,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price and provides a significant profit.
* **Encourage acceptance:** By meeting him halfway, I'm increasing the chances of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,325,000 for the product. I hope this helps move us towards an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my previous counteroffer, and it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer $1,350,000, accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a significant profit.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it risks losing the deal entirely or dragging things out.  I'm willing to take the slightly lower price for the certainty of a sale."
