"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a price below its true value, and I get a fair price for my hard work. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a healthy profit for you.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
