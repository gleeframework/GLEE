"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it at the same price, there's no benefit in rejecting her offer and buying from John for the same price. Accepting Alice's offer allows you to purchase the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay."
