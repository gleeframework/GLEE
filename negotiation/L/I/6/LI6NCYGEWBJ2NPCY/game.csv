"I've made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck. I'm willing to meet you at $13250, but I need you to meet me halfway this time. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250, but I expect you to meet me at that price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final offer: $13500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $12000.",13500.0,Alice,9,
