Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial value, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Alice's offer:

I understand the product is worth less to you than it is to me, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's already shown a willingness to pay more than John's price, and Alice is clearly open to negotiation.  There's room to push for a better deal."

This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
