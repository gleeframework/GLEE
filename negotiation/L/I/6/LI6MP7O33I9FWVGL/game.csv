"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I understand the product is worth less to you than it is to me, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a compromise that meets us halfway.  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction. What do you say?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
