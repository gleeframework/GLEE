"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate you reaching out.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $16,000 is a little too low for me.  Could you do $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $17,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",17000.0,Bob,4,
