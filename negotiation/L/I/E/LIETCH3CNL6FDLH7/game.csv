"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $90. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $90 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $70? That would be a great deal for me and still give you a decent profit.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $80, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",80.0,Alice,5,
