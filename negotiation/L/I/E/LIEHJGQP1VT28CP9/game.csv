"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that I believe is fair for both of us. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  My price is $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable, but $1,250,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle on $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1,212,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful it will be acceptable to you.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I respect that.  $1,212,500 is still a bit rich for me.  Let's try this - $1,190,000.  If that works for you, we have a deal.",1190000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up a bit. However, $1,190,000 is still a little too far from where I need to be. I understand that we're getting closer, and I'm willing to make one last compromise.  Let's split the difference once more.  I'm offering the product for $1,201,250.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.",1201250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me.  How about this as my final offer - $1,195,000.  Take it or leave it.",1195000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, and I respect that.  However, $1,195,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  To be honest, I'm surprised you're not willing to come up just a bit more, considering the value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  If you can increase your offer to $1,200,000, we have a deal. If not, I'm going to have to seriously consider my other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
