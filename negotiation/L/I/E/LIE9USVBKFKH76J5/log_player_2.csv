"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $15,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* You know John will sell you the product for $12,000. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to move forward with buying from John at your desired price."
