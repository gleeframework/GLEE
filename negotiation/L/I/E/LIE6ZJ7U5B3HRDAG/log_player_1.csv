It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.
