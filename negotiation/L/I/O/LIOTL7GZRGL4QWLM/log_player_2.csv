{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only one round left to negotiate with Alice. At this point, there's little room for further negotiation, and Alice's price of $11,100 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  Since he can purchase the product from John for $12,000, it's a better option to go with John and avoid risking getting a worse price in the final round."
