"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,750?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's try $10,900 - this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10900.0,Bob,6,
