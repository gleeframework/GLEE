Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to make him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**This approach aims to:**

* Secure a higher price than Bob's initial value.
* Start the negotiation at a favorable position for me.
*  Allow for potential counteroffers and further negotiation.
*  Leave the door open to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  If I can't get a satisfactory price from Bob, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

**Next steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  $11,000 is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept and avoid creating a hostile negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is a bit steep for me, I would like to propose $10,000 as a compromise. This still allows you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good deal on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result:** While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, there is a significant gap between our desired prices.  Further negotiation would likely be time-consuming and might not lead to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a much more secure outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob, where there's no guarantee of reaching a satisfactory price.

**Conclusion:**  While I would ideally prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, it's more advantageous to secure the $15,000 sale to John to guarantee my minimum acceptable profit."
