"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is a bit steep for me, I would like to propose $10,000 as a compromise. This still allows you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good deal on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
