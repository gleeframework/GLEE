"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for my product. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a little high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $90. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to look at other options.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're firm on $90, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet in the middle again at $102.50? I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I still need to make a decent profit.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're open to that, I think we can make a deal. ",95.0,Bob,6,
