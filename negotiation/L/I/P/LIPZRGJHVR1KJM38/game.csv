"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product.  However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13500?  That's still a good value for a product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $13500 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $13000, which I believe is fair given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
