"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find the product very valuable. Let's try to work together to make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite at $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. Let's seal the deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,250. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000 is still a bit too high, but $8,750 is a sweet spot for me. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
