{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a better deal. However, I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $10,000, so I'm not going to go too high and risk losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get more than Bob's initial counteroffer. This price is still higher than John's offer, so I'm not taking any major risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a profit, even though it's slightly less than I initially hoped for."
