# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
