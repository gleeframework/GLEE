"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price below its worth to you, and I'll get a fair price for something valuable to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what you'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal. You can try to get the price down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is still within your budget and significantly lower than what John is offering.  Accepting this offer will allow you to save $500,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
