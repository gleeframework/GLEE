Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation while still leaving room for me to potentially earn more than my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$50 is far too low, even considering the risk of selling to John.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $175. This is a significant increase from his offer, but still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'll counteroffer Bob again, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $140. This is closer to his last offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is getting close to my minimum, I've been through several rounds of negotiation and it seems Bob is unwilling to meet my price.  To avoid further delays, I'm going to sell to John for $150."
