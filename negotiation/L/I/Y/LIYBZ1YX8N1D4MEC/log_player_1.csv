{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested in this price, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $100.  While it's tempting to take the $70, I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my starting point. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by engaging in further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $120. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation.  Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, and I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to make a higher counteroffer.  If he doesn't, I'll be happy to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm finally offering my minimum price of $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'm happy to sell to John for the same price."
