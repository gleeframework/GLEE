{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $15,000 as my initial offer, aiming for a profit while leaving some room for negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $12,000?  That's still a great price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still seeking a more reasonable price. I would like to propose $11000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $11,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable amount.  I'm confident that I can find a way to make a profit even at this price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
