"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll really love. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, so Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. It is better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $8,000. It is more strategic to continue negotiating and make a counteroffer, hoping to reach a price that's closer to Bob's desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,000.  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm counteroffering at $9800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $9,800 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  While it's closer,  Bob has already made his final counteroffer and it was rejected. There is no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price. Given that John is selling the product for $8,000, the most prudent decision is to buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
