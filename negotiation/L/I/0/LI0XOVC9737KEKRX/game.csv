"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8000.  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm counteroffering at $9800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Alice,5,
