"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $110 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90? I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming to get the price closer to his maximum of $80.  
* **Reasonable Offer:** $90 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about buying but also wants a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes fairness, leaving room for Alice to counter if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for further negotiation. 
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:** By rejecting, Bob can continue to try and lower the price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is still trying to get a better price.
* **Small Increment:** Increasing the offer by $5 is a smaller step, suggesting a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Using phrases like ""fair price"" helps maintain a positive tone and encourages Alice to consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $97.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has continued to lower the price, $97.5 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has a few rounds left, so there is still an opportunity to potentially get a better price.
* **Strategic Move:** Rejecting keeps the negotiation going and maintains pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, which is closer to my budget. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Within Budget:** Bob is sticking to his maximum budget and showing that he's willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Small Incremental Increase:** The offer is only $5 lower than Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""reflects the value of the product"" helps to maintain a positive tone and encourages Alice to consider accepting."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $95. It's still a good price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's offer of $95 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $80. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  Bob only has three rounds left, so he needs to be strategic and try to get the price as low as possible.
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:** Rejecting gives Bob a chance to try and get Alice to lower the price even further, potentially reaching a price closer to his $80 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $95 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price considering we're both getting closer to a deal.  Let's finalize this transaction and make it work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Consistent:** Bob sticks to his goal of getting the price closer to $80, but shows willingness to compromise.
* **Final Push:** This offer is a strong indication that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't go higher.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes fairness and a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome, encouraging Alice to accept."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $90, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $92. It's still a good price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  Bob only has one round left. 
* **Limited Gains:**  Alice's final offer is $92, which is still above Bob's $80 limit.
* **Guaranteed Savings:**  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for $80, a price he knows he can afford. 

While Bob might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal with Alice in the final round, it's risky. Buying from John ensures he gets the product at his maximum budget, minimizing the chance of overspending."
