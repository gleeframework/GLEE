"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1050000? I think that's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to make it happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal happen, but I need to be careful with my finances.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal happen. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free warranty and a dedicated support package, which would normally cost $50000. This way, you'll get an even better value for your money. Would you be interested in revisiting the price at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $970000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the extras you're throwing in. Can we meet at this price?",970000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll throw in an additional warranty extension, which would normally cost $20000, on top of the existing offer. This way, you'll get an even better deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1020000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional warranty extension, but I'm still not willing to pay $1020000. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the extras you're offering. Can we meet at this price?",990000.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant number of concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1020000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm concerned that I might be leaving money on the table. I'm going to give you one last chance to meet me at $1020000. If not, I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer who is willing to pay the minimum price of $1200000.",1020000.0,Alice,11,
