"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. To start our negotiation, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point, given the product's significant value. Please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the current market conditions and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000.
