Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening position that allows for room to negotiate. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but also to leave space to potentially meet Bob halfway.  I'm confident that the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than what I can get from John.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This is still a good price for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, he'll see this as a good compromise and accept my offer.  I'm not willing to go any lower than this, as $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than what I could get from John, but it's getting close.  I'm going to accept his offer.  I'd rather sell the product to Bob now, rather than risk going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $800,000. I'm confident that I can find another buyer for this type of product in the future, and I'm happy with this outcome."
