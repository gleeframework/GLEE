"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to raise his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering at $175. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing a sale by being too stubborn. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
