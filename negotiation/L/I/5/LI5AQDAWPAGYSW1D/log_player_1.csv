{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum of $150, but it allows for some negotiation room. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value of $80. If he rejects, I can then counter with a higher price, or potentially go to John if I feel he won't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and get closer to my target of $150 by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $120?  This is a really great product and I think it's worth the extra investment."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $120 is still slightly out of my preferred range, I'd like to try to find common ground. Could we agree on $110 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $110 is closer to my desired price, I'm still going to try and push for a bit more. I want to see if there's any wiggle room with Bob before selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. I'm still a little bit away from my target price.  Would you consider $115?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with this product for that price."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. I would like to propose $110 as the final price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob seems firm on his offer of $110.  I'm not willing to go that low, so I'll sell to John for $150. It's a sure thing and meets my minimum requirements."
