"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's something that holds significant value for me, and I think it could be equally beneficial for your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a price I believe is fair, considering the potential value it offers.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price John is asking. Buying from Alice saves Bob $500,000.  Even if Bob doesn't know the exact value of the product to Alice, the potential savings are too great to pass up."
