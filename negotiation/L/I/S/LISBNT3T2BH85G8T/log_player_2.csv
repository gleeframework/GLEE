"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. You can always come back and accept her offer later if necessary, or proceed with John's offer as a fallback."
