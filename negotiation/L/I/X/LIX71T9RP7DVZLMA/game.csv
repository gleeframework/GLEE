"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I know it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm thinking of a price around $9,500. What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is significantly below its value to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair offer considering the benefit you'll gain.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $7,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment, but I need to be upfront -  $7,000 is too far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but this needs to be a mutually beneficial deal. How about $8,500? That's my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,250? I think that's a fair compromise.",8250.0,Bob,6,
