Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but your initial price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in it, and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1550000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
