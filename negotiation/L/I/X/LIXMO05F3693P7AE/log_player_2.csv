"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1750000, reflecting the potential for significant returns. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but your initial price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in it, and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000, recognizing the value you see in the product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
