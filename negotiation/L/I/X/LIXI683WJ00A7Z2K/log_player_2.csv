"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $105 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still looking to save as much as possible. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $107.50 is closer, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about we settle on $109?  This is a small compromise, and I'm sure we can both agree on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible and $109 is too high for him. He's willing to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a lower price.  He can still potentially get a better deal with Alice than buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $108. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 108}
