"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll see it's a worthwhile investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,500. This is a fair offer considering the product's quality and what it can do for you.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can stretch to $13,000, but that's my limit. It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
