"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. While I value it at $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. It's a significant opportunity, and I'm confident this product can deliver substantial returns. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a discount from her stated value, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  You should try to negotiate a better price with Alice or move on to John's offer."
