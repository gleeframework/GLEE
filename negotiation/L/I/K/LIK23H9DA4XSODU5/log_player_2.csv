"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price just for you, Bob. I'm willing to let you have it for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, so rejecting her initial offer opens the door for potential savings."
