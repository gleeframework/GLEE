,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $7500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your offer, but I think we can still work towards a lower price. Considering the market value and the condition of the product, would you consider selling it for $6000?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $6000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $6500? This feels like a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",6500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can still reach an agreement closer to my budget. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, would you consider selling it for $6200?",6200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6200 is still a little below what I'm hoping for.  Considering how much we've already negotiated, I'm willing to meet you halfway -  $6350.  This seems like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",6350.0,Alice,7,
