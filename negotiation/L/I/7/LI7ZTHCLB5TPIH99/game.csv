"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still give you a significant discount and ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your original offer. How about we try $1,075,000? This would be a great compromise for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
