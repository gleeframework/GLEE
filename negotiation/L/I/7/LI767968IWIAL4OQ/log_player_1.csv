Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 

**Why not ask for more?**

While Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's no guarantee he'd be willing to pay that full amount.  A slightly lower offer increases the chances of him accepting without negotiation, securing a significant profit for Alice."
