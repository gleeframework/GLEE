{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're starting above your minimum of $1,000,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $1,500,000 value, which leaves space for Bob to counter and for you to find a mutually beneficial price. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the value of the product, but also willing to negotiate. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $900,000, it's significantly less than what you could potentially get. 

**Reasoning:**

* **John's offer:**  You have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so any deal with Bob needs to be better than that.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  You have room to counter and potentially reach a higher price.

**Next Step:** You will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $1,200,000 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but still maintaining a firm stance on your value.
* **Focus on the Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how this price is still a good deal for him. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, implying that a middle ground is possible.

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob to come up a bit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1050000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  Bob's offer is just slightly below your initial offer of $1,200,000 and significantly above John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:** While you could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving you with only John's offer. 
* **Secure the deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of losing a potential buyer.

It's a good compromise, and you've managed to secure a good price for your product."
