"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a more affordable price. Would you consider selling the product for $120?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $120 is too low for me, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $150?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. This is still within my budget and moves us closer to a mutually beneficial solution.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $150. I've got a few more rounds to work with, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be reasonable. How about $145? It's a compromise, and it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $140 for the product. This is still within my budget and brings us closer to a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob.  Even though I'm only $10 away from my desired price, there's a risk I could go through the next couple of rounds and end up with a lower offer.  It's better to secure the $150 from John and end the negotiation."
