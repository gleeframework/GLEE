Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80. While it's tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering Bob a counteroffer of $95. This is still above his initial offer of $80, but closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Hopefully, this will be a more appealing price point for Bob, allowing us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer to $85, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I've reached the point where I'm comfortable selling to John for $100, as it guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
