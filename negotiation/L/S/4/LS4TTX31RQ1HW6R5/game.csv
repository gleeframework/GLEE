"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that I think will benefit both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could make a move to $750,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering the value it brings to my business.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I can see we're both motivated to make this deal happen.  How about we settle at $780,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it for this product.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a significant investment, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I propose a price of $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.
