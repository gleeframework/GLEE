"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it seems like a nice item, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $95? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is still a touch more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $87?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $87 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $92? It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",92.0,Alice,5,
