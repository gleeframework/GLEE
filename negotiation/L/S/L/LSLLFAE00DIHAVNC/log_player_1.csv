{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. I'm aiming for a win-win situation, where Bob gets a good deal and I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $115?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. $115 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about $120?  That's my absolute limit, but it would allow us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and it's the same price I can get from John. Since I'm focused on maximizing my earnings, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision."
