Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You've stated the product is worth at least $8,000 to you, so this offer gives you a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust this offer up or down depending on how Bob reacts. If he seems hesitant, you might lower it slightly. If he seems enthusiastic, you could try to push for a higher price. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to get Bob to accept the offer!"
