Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a significant amount above my minimum threshold of $100. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway before considering selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, but still giving me a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $128 is still a decent profit and I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept Bob's offer."
