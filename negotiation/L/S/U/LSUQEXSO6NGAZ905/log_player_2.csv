Alice's offer:

This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

Alice is clearly holding firm closer to her price, and while another counter-offer *might* work,  it's getting risky. Accepting at $13,250 secures a decent discount from both your top price and John's offer."
