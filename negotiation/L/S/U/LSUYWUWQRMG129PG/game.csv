"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $15,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $16,750?  I'm confident you'll still get a good deal at that price.",16750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,750 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
