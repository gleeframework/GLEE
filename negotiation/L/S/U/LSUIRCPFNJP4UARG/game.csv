"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,500.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  However, $17,500 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Could you do $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
