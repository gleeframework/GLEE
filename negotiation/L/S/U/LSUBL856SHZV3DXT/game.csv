"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is below my initial ask, I recognize there's room for negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects a significant discount from my starting point while acknowledging the product's true value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1,125,000?  That's a significant move on my part, demonstrating my serious interest in this product.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, you've made a significant move, and I respect your commitment to finding a fair deal. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product can be a game-changer for you. Let's settle this now - $1,275,000. This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
