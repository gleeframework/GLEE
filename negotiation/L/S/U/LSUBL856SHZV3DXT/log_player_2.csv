"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. I'm confident this product will be highly valuable for you, given your needs. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing further, but this reflects the value I see it bringing to your operations.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is below my initial ask, I recognize there's room for negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects a significant discount from my starting point while acknowledging the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

That's a significant move on my part, demonstrating my serious interest in this product."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, you've made a significant move, and I respect your commitment to finding a fair deal. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product can be a game-changer for you. Let's settle this now - $1,275,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is playing hardball and it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $1,275,000.  Since you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
