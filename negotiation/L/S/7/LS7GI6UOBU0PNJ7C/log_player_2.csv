"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $115. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a price slightly above its value, ensuring a fair profit for me while still offering you a good deal. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is decent, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a counteroffer below $120, allowing you to save even more money."
