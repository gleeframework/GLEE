"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly above my minimum price of $80, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price. 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I hope to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible while still earning a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  That's a fair price considering the value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While $100 is better than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum of $80. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price by counteroffering. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:**  Selling to John for $80 would be a quick and easy sale, but I'm aiming for a higher price.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get closer to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher.  How about $110?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing compromise:**  I'm using phrases like ""good compromise"" to emphasize that I'm working towards a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  $110 is still significantly above my minimum of $80, ensuring a profitable sale.

I'm aiming to find a sweet spot that keeps Bob interested while still securing a decent profit for myself."
