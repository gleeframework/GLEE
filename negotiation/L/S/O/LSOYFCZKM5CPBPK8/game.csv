"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $140.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $120, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise again. I'll meet you at $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"I've already told you, Bob, I won't go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $130, which is $125. That's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",125.0,Alice,7,
