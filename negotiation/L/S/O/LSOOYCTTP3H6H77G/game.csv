"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll be happy with.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,000? This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $9,250 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits us both, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $9,625? This feels like a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach a final agreement. What do you think?",9625.0,Alice,5,
