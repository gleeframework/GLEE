{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

This strategy allows me to maximize potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob the opportunity to accept the offer. If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  While I want to maximize profit, I am also willing to negotiate further.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,000? This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $10,000 represents a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm reframing the counteroffer as leaving ""room for both of us to be satisfied,"" emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to keep the negotiation moving forward and encourage Bob to respond. 

By making this counteroffer, I'm trying to find a middle ground that is closer to my desired price while also being more appealing to Bob than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $9,250 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits us both, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a better agreement.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually beneficial price with Bob.  I will reject his offer and make a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $9,625? This feels like a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach a final agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This offer represents a final compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him feel like it's a win-win situation.
* **Clear closing statement:**  I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, clearly indicating this is my final offer and hoping for a final agreement. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000, as further negotiation seems unlikely to produce a better outcome for me."
