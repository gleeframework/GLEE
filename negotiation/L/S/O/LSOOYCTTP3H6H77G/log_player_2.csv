Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,000? This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts.

You're still aiming to save as much money as possible, and $10,000 is closer to your target but still a bit high.  Reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $9,625? This feels like a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach a final agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,625

While $9,625 is closer to your target, it's still above your $8,000 limit. It's better to buy the product from John, as you're guaranteed to get it for your maximum price."
