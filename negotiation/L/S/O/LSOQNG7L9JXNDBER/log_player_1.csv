Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm confident I can get at least $80 from John, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $75 is below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is still above my minimum, but it's closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price from Bob, and I risk losing time.  Selling to John for the same price is a sure thing."
