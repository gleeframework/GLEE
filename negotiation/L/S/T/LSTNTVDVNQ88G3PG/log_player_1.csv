"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good price, while also gauging Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm serious about negotiating, while also giving him room to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,250,000 is still below my minimum value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a good profit margin for me.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm going to try and squeeze out a bit more from Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,550,000.  This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price and signals that I'm serious about closing a deal. It's a risky move, as I'm getting very close to my bottom line, but with only a few rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a genuine attempt to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation with Bob seems to be stalled.  I'm not sure if he'll come up to my desired price, and risking further rejections could leave me with a lower final price.  Therefore, it's more sensible to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. This ensures I reach my minimum goal and avoids the risk of losing more money with Bob."
