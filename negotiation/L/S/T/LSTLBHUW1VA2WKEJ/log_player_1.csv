Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to the value I know the product has for Bob ($10,000), but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is not completely unreasonable, but it allows for Bob to counteroffer if he feels the price is too high. 
* **Security net:** I still have John as a backup buyer, so if negotiations fall through, I'm not stuck with a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $8,500 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I can likely get a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him I'm not desperate to sell at his price and have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering within a reasonable range:** I'm not going too low, but I'm also not sticking to my original price. I'm showing flexibility, but not desperation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob about the product's worth, making him more inclined to accept a slightly higher price.
* **Call to action:**  I'm prompting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,800 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  I've already lowered my price significantly. Another counteroffer might risk losing Bob completely. 
* **Securing a sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit above my minimum, which is important.

It's important to note that this decision is based on the given information and the goal of maximizing profit. In a real-world scenario, there might be other factors to consider, such as the relationship with Bob, the potential for future business, and the time invested in negotiations."
