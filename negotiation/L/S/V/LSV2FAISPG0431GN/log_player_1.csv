"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a starting price of $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique opportunity"" and ""potential"" of the product without explicitly stating what it is. This framing aims to intrigue Bob and potentially justify the high price in his mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting price"" clearly signals to Bob that I am open to negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His reaction will reveal how interested he is and how far he might be willing to go. 
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Even if he rejects this initial high offer, it sets the stage for a potentially more profitable deal than selling immediately to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my target price. Bob's willingness to negotiate implies there's room to push for a better deal. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, and your interest in the product. It clearly holds value for you. Considering its unique nature and potential for return, I'm aiming for a price closer to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** I've lowered my price by $150,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Holding Firm:** The new price is still significantly above both his offer and my minimum, maintaining pressure towards a more profitable outcome for me.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's ""unique nature"" and ""potential return"" to justify the higher price and keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

The goal is to find a balance between demonstrating flexibility and holding firm to my higher valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is meeting me halfway between our previous offers. This signifies a strong commitment to the negotiation and a willingness to find a compromise.  

While $1,950,000 is slightly below my initial target, it represents a significant profit over my minimum selling price and a successful negotiation outcome. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or my position weakening in further rounds."
