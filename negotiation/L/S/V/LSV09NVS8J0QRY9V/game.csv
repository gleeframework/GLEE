"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still gives you a substantial opportunity for profit, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a reasonable profit. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
