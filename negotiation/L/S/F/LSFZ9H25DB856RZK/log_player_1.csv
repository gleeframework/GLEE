Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I can start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $170 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping me above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and potential for negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm not losing anything because I have John as a backup buyer."
