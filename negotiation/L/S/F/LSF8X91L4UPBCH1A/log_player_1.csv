"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $2,000,000.  I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a strong opening offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point and leaves room for concessions. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  The high price will help gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information for the next round.
* **Time is Money:** While we have 10 rounds, there's always the risk that Bob won't budge much.  Having John as a backup ensures we don't waste time on a lowball offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counter-offer is a significant move, but it's still considerably above his valuation. We have room to negotiate further. Selling to John would be our minimum acceptable outcome, and we're not there yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. While your initial offer was a bit lower than I had hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Meeting Bob halfway shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, which can help build rapport. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counter-offer is still significantly above Bob's valuation, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Pressure and Incentive:** Offering a concession might incentivize Bob to make a more substantial move in the next round, while the high price reminds him of the potential deal he could be getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $1,850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,850,000 is a significant profit margin, even though it's slightly below our initial target. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Prolonged negotiations can be draining and risky. Accepting now secures a good deal without the uncertainty of further back-and-forth.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While we could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, there's no guarantee. Accepting now allows us to move on to other potential deals."
