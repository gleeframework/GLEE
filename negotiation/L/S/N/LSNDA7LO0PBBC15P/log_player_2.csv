"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I am proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  You want to save as much money as possible, and you have 10 rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I propose a price of $890,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it will be beneficial for both parties involved.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While you'd prefer a lower price, accepting this offer still saves you $310,000 compared to buying from John.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to lock in a deal before the price potentially rises again or you run out of time."
