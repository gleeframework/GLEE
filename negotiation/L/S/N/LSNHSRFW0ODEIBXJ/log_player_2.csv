You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents a fair price for its value, I understand that's not quite in your budget.  Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

$140 is still more than you're willing to pay. You'll need to counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go lower than $120.  This is my final offer.

While $120 is closer to your budget, it's still above your $80 limit.  You can get the product from John for less, so that's the best option."
