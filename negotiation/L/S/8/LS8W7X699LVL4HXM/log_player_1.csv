Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know if you're interested! "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This is a price that is  higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is designed to be persuasive. I emphasize the benefit to Bob (""great deal"") and  frame it as a win-win situation. 

**Reasoning:**

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I increase the likelihood that he'll accept.  However, the price is still significantly lower than my fallback option with John, ensuring I make a profit."
