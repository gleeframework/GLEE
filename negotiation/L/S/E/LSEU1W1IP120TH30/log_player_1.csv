{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still below your minimum desired value of $12,000. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit below what I need to let this product go. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get great value from this product."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I would like to keep my offer at $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has clearly set his maximum price at $9,500, which is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of going through multiple rounds and potentially ending up with a lower price isn't worth it.  I'm better off selling to John for $12,000 and ensuring I get my desired profit."
