We're getting close, but I still think we can get a better price from Bob.  It's too early to settle for John's offer."

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  

We've reached a point where the difference is relatively small, and we're running out of rounds. While we could push for a bit more, there's a risk Bob will walk away, leaving us with John's lower offer. Accepting $1,090,000 secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of losing a good deal."
