"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your target price is $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope this counteroffer is a step in the right direction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're considering another offer, but I'm not willing to meet it at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I hope this counteroffer is acceptable, but if not, I'm prepared to move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,075,000.  It's not worth risking missing John's offer for a potential savings of $75,000 in a future round."
