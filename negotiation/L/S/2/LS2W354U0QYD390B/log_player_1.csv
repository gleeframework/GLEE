Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. I still have 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

This is a great deal for me! Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate."
