Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This price allows for potential compromise without dropping below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage. If Bob rejects my offer, I can easily walk away and secure a sale with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially considering I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay a higher price.
* **Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and can potentially secure a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Avoiding John:** This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, making it more attractive to him than selling to John for $12,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and see if he's genuinely interested in reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $200 away from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of Losing John:**  There's a real risk that John might back out or find another option if I continue to reject offers. 
* **Time Factor:**  Further negotiation might take time, and I want to avoid the potential of a stalemate. 

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable choice. It secures a sale that is close to my minimum, and it minimizes the risk of losing a better option with John."
