Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  To reach an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant commitment, and I believe it represents a fair price considering both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** $1,400,000 is still a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer throughout the negotiation, indicating a serious interest in purchasing. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer or stalling. Accepting now secures the deal. 

Although John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, the potential to earn an extra $100,000 by securing the deal with Bob now outweighs the risk of continuing the negotiation."
