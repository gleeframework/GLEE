"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that is sure to be mutually beneficial. I know this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can reach a fair price.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. This represents a substantial gain for you, while still allowing me to achieve a considerable return. Let me know your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice or simply go with John's offer."
