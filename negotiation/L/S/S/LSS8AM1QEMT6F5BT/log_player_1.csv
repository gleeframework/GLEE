Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,800,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum value. It's important to start high, as you can always adjust the price during negotiations.  This message also tries to emphasize the value of the product, which might make Bob more likely to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than your minimum desired value of $1,200,000, so it's not worth accepting. You have a better backup option with John. However, there is still room for negotiation with Bob, so rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,600,000 to make this work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is slightly below your desired minimum, but it's still above your guaranteed value with John.  It's a good idea to accept this offer as there's a risk of further negotiation with Bob going lower, or you could choose to sell to John and receive a lower price."
