Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell at the minimum price, I believe I can get closer to my desired amount. I will counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,300,000? This still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal, but gets us closer to your price point."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit away from your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would ideally like to get closer to $1,400,000,  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a fair compromise.  This is a significant gain over selling to John for $1,200,000 and leaves some room for negotiation in the future.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
