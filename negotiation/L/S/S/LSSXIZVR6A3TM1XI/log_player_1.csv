Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By opening with a strong offer near Bob's perceived value, we establish a strong bargaining position.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $50,000 gap between our asking price and Bob's value provides space for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer with confidence, subtly encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a substantial sum and significantly above our minimum, we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation. Accepting his first counteroffer might leave money on the table. We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm above our minimum. A $50,000 concession on our part may encourage him to reciprocate.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price without being overly aggressive. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help us gauge Bob's flexibility and willingness to move closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000. How about we settle on $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** At $875,000, we are securing a $75,000 profit above our minimum acceptable price. This is a substantial gain.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the incremental gain is likely to be small and potentially not worth the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has an opportunity cost.  Accepting now allows us to conclude the deal and potentially pursue other opportunities."
