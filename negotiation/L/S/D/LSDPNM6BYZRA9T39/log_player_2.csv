You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

It's not worth paying $18,000 for a product worth $15,000 to you.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's below my maximum price and leaves room for some potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

While I'd prefer to pay less, $16,000 is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John.  I'll accept Alice's offer."
