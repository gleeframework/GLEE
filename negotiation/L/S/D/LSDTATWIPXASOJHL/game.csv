"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1250000. This is a fair offer, considering the product's immense value. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering your potential profit and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1000000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's true value and the potential it holds for you, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1150000.  This gives you a substantial deal and me a reasonable profit.  Let's try to find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still above my limit. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. This allows for a good profit for you and fits comfortably within my budget. Let's make this deal happen!",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact you're trying to find a solution.  While $1075000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  I'm prepared to come down to $1125000, which reflects a significant concession on my part.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
