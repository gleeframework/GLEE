"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1250000. This is a fair offer, considering the product's immense value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While the product is valuable, it's still far above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering your potential profit and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1000000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's true value and the potential it holds for you, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1150000.  This gives you a substantial deal and me a reasonable profit.  Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with, but it's getting closer to my target price. There's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if I can get her to come down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still above my limit. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This allows for a good profit for you and fits comfortably within my budget. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact you're trying to find a solution.  While $1075000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  I'm prepared to come down to $1125000, which reflects a significant concession on my part.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,125,000 is still more than my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over Alice's previous offers and is very close to my budget. Since this is Alice's ""final offer,"" rejecting it might mean we get stuck in a stalemate and I'll have to buy from John for a much higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
