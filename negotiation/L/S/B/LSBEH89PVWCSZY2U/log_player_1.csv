Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still earning significantly more than your minimum desired price.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate further without risking losing too much money. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for it.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $9,800 for this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of slowly decreasing the price, hoping that Bob will meet me halfway.  This offer is still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's looking like $9,600 is the best I can get from Bob.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I'm happy with this deal. It's above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John at a lower profit."
