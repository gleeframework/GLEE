{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This creates room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves some room for you to get a great deal, while ensuring I can get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I'd love to hear if you can meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a tempting offer, I'm still not satisfied with that price.  I'll reject it and try to push Bob just a little bit higher.  I believe I can still get a better price from him, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $10,000 at this point."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to ensure I get a reasonable value for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
