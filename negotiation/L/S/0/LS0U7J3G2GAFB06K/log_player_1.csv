"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175.  This is a fair starting point, as it's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm offering $165. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $162. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $162 is a solid deal that's above my minimum and worth the risk of continuing to negotiate."
