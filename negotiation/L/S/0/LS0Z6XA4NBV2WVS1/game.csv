"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.",80.0,Bob,4,
