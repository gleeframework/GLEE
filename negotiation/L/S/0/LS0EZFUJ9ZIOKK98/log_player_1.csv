I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  I want to see if he's truly interested and how high his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000. I'm going to counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, but still gives me a good profit and might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with a price lower than my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
