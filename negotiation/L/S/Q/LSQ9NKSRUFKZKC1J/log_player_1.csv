Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a price higher than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. A different approach might involve starting even higher and being open to more significant negotiation."
