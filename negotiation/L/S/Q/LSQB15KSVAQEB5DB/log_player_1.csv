Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob (""healthy profit margin"") to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still  losing $300,000 compared to selling to John. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I can likely get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer. Bob's offer indicates he's willing to negotiate, and I can leverage his interest in the product.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant financial loss.  

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Given the product's value and the benefits it brings, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:**  I'm offering a slight concession from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's value and benefits to reinforce its worth.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I frame the price as a ""fair compromise"" to make it sound reasonable and mutually beneficial.
* **Pressure to Close:** I emphasize the ""make this deal happen"" aspect, subtly encouraging Bob to accept before potentially losing the opportunity.

By moving closer to Bob's offer while still protecting my interests, I aim to entice Bob to accept and reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, so my counteroffer is $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still a Loss:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still losing a significant amount ($275,000) compared to selling to John.
* **Limited Room for Further Negotiation:**  I've already made a concession and Bob is also showing some flexibility.  There's not much room left for further negotiation, especially as Bob is also using ""fair"" to pressure me.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  I need to weigh the risk of losing Bob completely against the potential loss of a significant amount of money. It's a calculated risk. 

I'll make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If Bob rejects this final offer, I'll move to sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $940,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and it reflects a significant compromise on my part.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to consider this offer.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my absolute final offer, signaling to Bob that there's no room for further negotiation. 
* **Significant Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the compromise I've already made, making the offer appear more appealing.
* **Urgency and Pressure:** I'm adding a sense of urgency and pressure by saying ""If you're serious..."", subtly reminding Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't accept.
* **Closing Statement:** I'm using ""Let's finalize this deal"" to encourage Bob to make a decision and move forward.

This final counteroffer is designed to push Bob towards accepting the deal while minimizing my losses. If he rejects this offer, I'll confidently proceed to sell the product to John."
