"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $9,000. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm really hoping to stay closer to $9,000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $9,750? This would allow me to purchase the product without going over budget, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay close to your budget, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to offer you $10,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
