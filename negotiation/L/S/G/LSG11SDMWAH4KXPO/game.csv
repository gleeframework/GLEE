"While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of this product to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth and gives you a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $800,000? This price is fair for both of us, as it's right in the middle of what we're both aiming for, and would allow us to finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
