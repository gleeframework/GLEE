# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can save a significant amount of money by negotiating further. While buying from John is an option, it's far more expensive than what you can potentially achieve with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth and gives you a good deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price point, there's still room for negotiation.  $850,000 is still too high, and you can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer.  Buying from John is still a very expensive option, so continuing to negotiate with Alice is the best course of action."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $800,000? This price is fair for both of us, as it's right in the middle of what we're both aiming for, and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
