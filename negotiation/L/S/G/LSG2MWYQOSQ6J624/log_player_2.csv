Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. In light of this, I am prepared to reconsider our initial offer. I am now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is our best offer given the value of the product and the opportunity to work with a valued customer like yourself.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher. It's worth trying to push for a lower price, as there are still rounds remaining. You can also still choose to buy from John if you don't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement within your budget. In light of this, I am prepared to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is our final offer, as it reflects a balance between the value of the product and our desire to accommodate your financial constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will refuse further concessions.  It's safer to buy from John at this point to guarantee the purchase within your budget."
