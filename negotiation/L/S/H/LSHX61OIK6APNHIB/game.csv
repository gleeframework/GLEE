"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This price is still reasonable considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm confident that $8750 is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Would you be willing to accept this offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $8750 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $8875 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and our ongoing negotiations. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8875 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $8700 for the product. This represents a fair price that respects the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8700.0,Bob,6,
