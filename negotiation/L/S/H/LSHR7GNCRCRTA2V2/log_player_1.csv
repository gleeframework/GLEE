Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The high price will help me gauge Bob's level of interest. If he outright rejects it, I know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, it suggests he's seriously interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $150. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $120 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer to his perceived value, I have room to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I could come down a bit, how about $170?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm significantly decreasing my price from $200 to $170, showing willingness to negotiate. This puts the offer closer to the middle ground between my initial ask and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $170 is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring a reasonable profit if he accepts.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving some space for further negotiation. Bob might counter again, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $170 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of him walking away is increasing. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John for the same price."
