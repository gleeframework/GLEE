"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $2,000,000. I believe it presents a unique value proposition at this price point, and I'm confident it can exceed the value you anticipate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer is far too high. It's time to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is significantly closer to the value this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,700,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing. John's offer is guaranteed, and it's the best deal for me."
