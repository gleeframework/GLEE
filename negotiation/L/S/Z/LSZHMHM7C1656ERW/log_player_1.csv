Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,999.  I think it's a great deal for something you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 9999} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I know John will buy it for $10,000, getting Bob to pay close to that amount maximizes my profit.
* **High but Negotiable:** $9,999 is a strong starting point, implying the product's high value. It leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he negotiates down slightly.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  I don't explicitly mention John, but the high price suggests I'm confident in the product's value and someone else might be willing to pay a premium."
