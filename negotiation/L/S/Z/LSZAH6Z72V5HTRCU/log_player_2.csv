# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **You still save money:**  Even at $1,200,000, you are getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option."
