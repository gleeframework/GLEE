{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than my minimum but not too high that it scares Bob off right away. The message is friendly and aims to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm confident I can get more from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 is still below my initial desired price, it is above my minimum. I am willing to accept this offer, as it is likely that further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price."
