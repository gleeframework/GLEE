# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your ideal price point. You can likely negotiate further and get a better deal. There's no reason to rush into accepting her first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested,  $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000? I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700000 is a bit below your target, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $725000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $725,000 is a good compromise.  It's still within your budget and saves you $75,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gains."
