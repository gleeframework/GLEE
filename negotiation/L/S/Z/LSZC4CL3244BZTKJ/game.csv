"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested,  $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $700000? I believe this price is fair for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700000 is a bit below your target, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $725000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product considering its value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
