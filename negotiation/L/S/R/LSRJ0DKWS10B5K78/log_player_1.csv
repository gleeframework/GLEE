Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a significant profit above her minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't want to price herself out of a sale, but she also doesn't need to settle for the absolute minimum."
