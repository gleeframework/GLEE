"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is under your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in an attempt to secure the sale.  Since your alternative is buying from John at $1,200,000, you have some room to negotiate with Alice."
