,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

I'll lower the price to $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
