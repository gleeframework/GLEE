"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product is truly worth it.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $12,500? That seems like a fair compromise, considering we're both trying to find a price that works.",12500.0,Bob,4,
