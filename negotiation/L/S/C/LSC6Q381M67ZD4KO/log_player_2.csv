"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  $14,000 is too close to his maximum price of $15,000.  There is a good chance Alice will be willing to drop the price further to close the deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product is truly worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is a lower price than her initial offer, it's still too close to his maximum price of $15,000. He should try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to drop the price even lower."
