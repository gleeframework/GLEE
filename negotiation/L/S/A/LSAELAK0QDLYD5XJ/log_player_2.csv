"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a strong opening counteroffer, and it immediately establishes my price limit. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to come down to this price to avoid losing the sale."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $800,000 to $900,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm unwilling to go beyond my budget.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to continue to negotiate with her, hoping to get a better price. There's still time to close a deal before I have to consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even though it has come down from her initial offer. I want to try to close the deal closer to my budget, and I'm not willing to go above $1 million.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping this will signal to Alice that I'm willing to pay a bit more but am still holding firm on my budget.  With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
