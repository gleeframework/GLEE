"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I am offering it to you at a special price tailored to our mutual interests. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value you place on the product while allowing us both to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. While Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value to you, the actual price is what matters."
