``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but below your minimum acceptable price. It sets a starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit too high. Would you be willing to accept $108?  I'm really interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.
