"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1300000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There's no rush to accept, and it's better to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I see its potential value.  However, your initial price is a bit above where I'm comfortable starting.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This leaves room for a good profit margin for you while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, but it still acknowledges the product's value.
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the potential value of the product, making it clear you're not dismissing it.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  By offering a price that's lower than your maximum, you create space for Alice to counter and find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I need to make sure I'm getting a decent return. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is fair:** Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which is her minimum acceptable price.  
* **The deal is good for you:** At $1,200,000, you're getting the product for $300,000 less than what you'd pay John.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** While you could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer, and you might end up paying more for the product. It's better to secure this deal and avoid potential complications."
