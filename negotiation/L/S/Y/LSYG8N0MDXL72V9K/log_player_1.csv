"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, I'm holding out for a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $900,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to a lower counteroffer isn't worth it.  It's time to close the deal and secure $800,000."
