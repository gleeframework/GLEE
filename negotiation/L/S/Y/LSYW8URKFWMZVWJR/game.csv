"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to purchase the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still feel that $16000 is too high for me. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $14000, but I'm willing to meet you at $16000 was my previous offer, and I'm not budging from that. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet you at $16500. I'd like to propose $15000 as a final offer, acknowledging the value you place on the product while staying within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,6,
