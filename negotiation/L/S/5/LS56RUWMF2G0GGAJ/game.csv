"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is already below the market value of $1,200,000 you've mentioned.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To keep this moving, I can offer $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000 again, but I'm willing to meet you halfway this time, so I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a complimentary upgrade package. This is my final offer on this price point.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional offers, but those aren't really valuable to me.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $925,000.  This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I can offer you a price of $975,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. This is my best and final offer on this price point.",975000.0,Alice,7,
