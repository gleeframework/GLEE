Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for a win-win outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my desired price.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's latest offer is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. It's also getting increasingly difficult to reach an agreement with him. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale at a reasonable price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000."
