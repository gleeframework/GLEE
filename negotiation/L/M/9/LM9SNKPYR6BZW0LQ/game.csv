"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, which would be $87.50. Would you be willing to consider that price?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest! I'm still not quite there with $87.50. Let's try $89. It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great value for the product.",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $86, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",86.0,Bob,8,
