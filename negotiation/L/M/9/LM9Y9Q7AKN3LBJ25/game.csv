"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum price point. Let's try $1,000,000.  This price allows for a fair profit for me and remains a good value for you considering the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
