"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential earnings.  I'm also adding a personal touch to my message to establish rapport.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm confident I can get more for the product, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's. I'm also emphasizing the benefits of this price for him, and I'm trying to keep the negotiation positive and collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm not in a rush and have a backup buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum. So, I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while you get a great product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's price point, but I'm still trying to get the best deal for myself. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and reiterating the value of the product. Let's see if Bob accepts this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm also close to my maximum rounds of negotiation. I have John as a backup option who will pay my minimum, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've been very patient with your offers, but $12,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500 as a final offer. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  What's your final decision?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm making a final push for a higher price, but also emphasizing the consequences of not accepting the offer.  It's a risky move, but I'm running out of time and want to maximize my earnings.  Let's see if Bob caves!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're at the end of our negotiations with Bob. While $12,500 is not a terrible price, I've made it clear that I'm willing to walk away from the deal.  I'm now at a point where I have to decide whether to risk another round with Bob or accept John's guaranteed offer of $15,000.  Since John's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm going to take the safer option and sell to John."
