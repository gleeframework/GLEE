Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to sell the product for $15,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below John's price. It's better to secure the product at $15,000 from John than risk Alice sticking to her price."
