{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $100 to you, right? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but below what it's worth to me. This gives him some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit. I'm also framing the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the value he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's a great product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me, even though it's higher than what the product is worth to him. I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value you've mentioned. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $130 is a decent profit and is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge much further, so accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
