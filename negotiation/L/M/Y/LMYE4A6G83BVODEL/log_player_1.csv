Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really love! I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price but it's still above my minimum. I will reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of $105. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just slightly below my desired price, but it's still above my minimum and worth accepting. This way I avoid risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or the necessity to sell to John for a much lower price."
