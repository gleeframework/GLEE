"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still above my budget. My final offer is $13000. I'm serious about buying this product, but I simply can't afford more. This price is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $13000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $14500 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll see the value in it.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go above my budget. My final offer remains $13000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if you agree. If you're not willing to accept my offer, I'll need to move on to another seller.",13000.0,Bob,6,
