"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $12,000, so I'd like to propose $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
