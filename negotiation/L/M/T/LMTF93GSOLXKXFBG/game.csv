"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,200. I'm counteroffering at $10,100. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my minimum price of $8,000.",10100.0,Alice,7,
