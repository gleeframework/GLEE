"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both her value for the product and my maximum price. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $9,000."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit above her value and my ideal price. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting close to a reasonable price, but her language suggests she might be willing to go a little lower still. I'll push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,200. I'm counteroffering at $10,100. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my minimum price of $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer by revealing her minimum price.  While I might be able to push her down another $100, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal at this point.  I'm getting the product for significantly less than John's price."
