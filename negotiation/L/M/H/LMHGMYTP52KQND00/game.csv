"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
