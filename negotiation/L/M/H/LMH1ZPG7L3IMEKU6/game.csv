"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1.2 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, as it's well above your stated value of $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer is still a good deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on the product.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
