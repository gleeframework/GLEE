"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Would you be open to considering that?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  That way we can both be happy and close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I can do $13,250, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm happy you're willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  This would allow both of us to feel good about the deal.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
