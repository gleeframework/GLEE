Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but I'm still a bit concerned about the cost. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. Let's try $1,100,000 again.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,062,500? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, his final offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. With limited rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing out on a much better offer from John. Selling to John will ensure I get my desired price and avoid further negotiation."
