Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence! $75 is still below my minimum, but I want to find a solution. Let's try $90. I think this is a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, the price is still higher than your maximum budget. It's unlikely Alice will go down to $80, so it's better to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
