"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:** This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It tests the waters:**  It will give me a sense of Bob's interest level and his potential budget. 

If Bob rejects this, I'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed strategically."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now.  While $1,200,000 meets my minimum, I believe there's potential to get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round to see if I can close the deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to give in completely.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** It demonstrates flexibility and shows I'm serious about making a deal.

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **It's close to my minimum:**  $1,250,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price, making it a solid deal.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get significantly higher.
* **Risk of John:**  John is a guaranteed $1,200,000, and I don't want to risk losing that by being too stubborn.

While I would have preferred a higher price,  accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes potential losses."
