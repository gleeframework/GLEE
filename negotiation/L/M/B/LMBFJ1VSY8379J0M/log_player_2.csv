"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you, and it's significantly more than I could get from anyone else. Let me know if you're interested!
