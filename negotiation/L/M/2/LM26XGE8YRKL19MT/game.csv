"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $105?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work.  $95 is closer, but I'm still a little ways from where I need to be. Let's split the difference - how about $100? That way we both get a little closer to what we're looking for.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",92.0,Bob,6,
