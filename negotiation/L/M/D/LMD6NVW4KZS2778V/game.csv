"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. However,  I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,335,000?  It's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1335000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,332,500.  I'm going to need just a bit more to make this work for me.  How about $1,334,000?  That's a very small difference, and it would allow us to close this deal.  I don't want to keep going back and forth, so this is my final offer.",1334000.0,Alice,9,
