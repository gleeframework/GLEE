{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I'm getting a good profit ($15) but still leaving room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone and highlights the value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm confident that I can still get closer to my desired price of $115. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $108 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired price point. While I could try for another counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. It's better to secure the deal now, as the risk of getting a lower offer from John outweighs the potential of a slightly higher price from Bob."
