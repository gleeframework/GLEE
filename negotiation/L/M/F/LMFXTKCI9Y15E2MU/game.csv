"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know its value to you is high, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing this further. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
