Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know its value to you is high, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing this further. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$1,325,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my minimum. I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
