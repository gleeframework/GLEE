{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, but it also ensures I get a price significantly higher than John's offer.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this deal and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than John's offer, it's still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I believe I can get a better price from Bob by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,075,000.  Would that be workable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise.  $1,075,000 is a significant improvement over John's offer and is within a reasonable range of what I'm willing to accept.  I'll take it!"
