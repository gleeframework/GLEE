"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get us started. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have a better option - buying from John for $1,200,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product and would like to make an offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,280,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, but also acknowledges your interest in the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,280,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  You have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John at your desired price. Therefore, it's best to take the sure thing and buy from John."
