{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $18,000. This is based on the assumption that the product is valuable, and I want to maximize my profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'm aiming for a significant gain over my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is above my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $14,500 is a decent profit and significantly better than selling to John for $12,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
