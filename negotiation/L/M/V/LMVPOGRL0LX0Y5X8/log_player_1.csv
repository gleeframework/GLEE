Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm willing to let it go for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen a price that's above my minimum but not too high to scare Bob off.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage him to engage. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize profit, but also consider the possibility of losing Bob as a customer if the price is too high.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $80 on this item. Would you consider adjusting the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $80 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $115?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $115, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing finding a price that works for both of us to keep the negotiation friendly and open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget, could we perhaps aim for $100 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more,  it's not worth risking a deal with Bob and potentially losing out on a sale entirely."
