"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $95? This is a fair price considering I'm already close to your asking price.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $105. This is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",105.0,Alice,5,
