You can likely get the product for less than $110, so continuing to negotiate is the best course of action."

Alice has come down to $108, which is only $3 more than your last counteroffer. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal. You can save $42 by buying from Alice compared to John."
