Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. This aligns more closely with what I am able to spend while still allowing me to acquire the product I need. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
