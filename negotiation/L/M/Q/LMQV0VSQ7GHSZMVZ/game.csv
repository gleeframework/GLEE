"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business or personal life. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. This aligns more closely with what I am able to spend while still allowing me to acquire the product I need. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it can bring, I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1200000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but unfortunately, $1200000 is still beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This amount reflects a compromise that is within my financial limits while still acknowledging the product's value. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you can consider.",900000.0,Bob,4,
