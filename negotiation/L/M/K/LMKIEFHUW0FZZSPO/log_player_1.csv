Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Gauging interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give me insight into his perceived value of the product and his willingness to negotiate. 

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
