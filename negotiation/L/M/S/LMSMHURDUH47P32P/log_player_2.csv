Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer who's willing to pay more if you don't accept."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $85, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Alice is coming down, but still not to your target price. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $80.  You've gotten a good price and saved some time in the negotiation."
