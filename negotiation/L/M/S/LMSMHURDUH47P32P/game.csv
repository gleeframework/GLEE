"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but that's my top limit.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer who's willing to pay more if you don't accept.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're firm on $85, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,5,
