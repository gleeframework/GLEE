"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price, as I know John is willing to pay that amount.  This will give me a baseline to work with and see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll reject and counter-offer.  There are still several rounds left and I can try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $110. This is still above Bob's offer but is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more reasonable price for Bob while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to continue negotiating. I have plenty of rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $105. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still a profit for me.  I'm hoping this shows that I'm serious about making a deal but won't be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob is inching closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject his offer. I'm not feeling pressured to accept his offer yet, and I still have a few more rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering my final compromise at $100. This is Bob's perceived value of the product, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping he'll accept and we can close the deal."
