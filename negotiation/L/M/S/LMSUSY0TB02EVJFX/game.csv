"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
