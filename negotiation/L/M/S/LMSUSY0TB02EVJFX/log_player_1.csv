Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent profit.
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a win-win scenario, knowing that a deal with Bob is better than selling to John at the moment. 
* I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I have a clear backup plan with John to ensure I don't get stuck in a dead-end negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential profit for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm also prepared to potentially reject his next counteroffer if it's too low.
* I'm keeping my options open with John, knowing I can always sell to him for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. Accepting would mean a significant loss in profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware of my backup option with John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000.
