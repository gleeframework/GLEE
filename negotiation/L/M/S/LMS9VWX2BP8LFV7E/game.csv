"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. While I'm interested, $145 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $130 for it, which still offers you a profit.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider $135 as the price for the product. This allows for a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive with your budget. Please let me know if this works for you.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $135 is closer, I'm still a bit above my limit.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $132. This is a fair price considering my budget and allows you a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finalize this.",132.0,Bob,4,
