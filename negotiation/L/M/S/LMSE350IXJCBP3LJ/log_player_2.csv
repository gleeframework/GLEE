Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $131.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $121.

Alice's offer is still too high, and we are running out of rounds. I'm not confident that I can get her to come down to my desired price, and I don't want to risk not getting the product at all. It's better to buy from John at $150 than risk losing out altogether."
