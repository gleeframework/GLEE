"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is above my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it yet. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a price closer to $140.  How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $128 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $128 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle from $128, which was my previous offer? That would be $129. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly higher than what I could get from John, I'm running out of rounds and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob."
