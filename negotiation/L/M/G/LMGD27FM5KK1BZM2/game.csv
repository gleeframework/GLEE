"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a price closer to $140.  How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $128?",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $128 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle from $128, which was my previous offer? That would be $129.",129.0,Bob,6,
