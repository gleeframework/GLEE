"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $17,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring a profit above my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is still above my minimum, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm concerned that further negotiations will only lead to a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is more important than potentially getting a higher price from Bob and risking ending up with less than $15,000."
