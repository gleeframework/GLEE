"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  You can counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down.  There's no guarantee, but it's worth a shot to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

You're still closer to John's price than Alice's.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice one more time to see if you can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go to $10,600. This is my final offer, as I can get the product for $10,000 elsewhere. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,600. I'll meet you halfway again and offer you $10,700. This is my best price, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've already negotiated a good price with Alice, but you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's better to save the extra $700 and go with John."
