"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's above my absolute minimum, it's still too low given the product's value to Bob. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to get closer to my ideal price.  I'm hoping this will be more attractive to Bob, but if he rejects again, I'll need to assess whether it's worth continuing or moving to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price, which means he's unwilling to go higher.  It's unlikely we'll be able to close a deal that benefits me more.  Therefore, I'll take John's offer to sell the product for $8,000."
