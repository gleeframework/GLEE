# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1400000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, given its potential worth to you.  This price reflects its inherent value and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Please let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $1000000.
