Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident that I can get at least $10,000 from John if I need to, so I'm not afraid to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for potential compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk losing the sale and ending up with $10,000 from John. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
