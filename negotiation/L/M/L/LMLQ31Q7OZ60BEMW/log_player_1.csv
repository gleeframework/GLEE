Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price, but still allows for some room to negotiate. If Bob rejects it, I can always counter with a higher price or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob's offers are still below my minimum of $120. It's better to sell to John for $120 and secure a good profit than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting stuck with a lower price."
