"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential benefits for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
