"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is lower than Bob's valuation but significantly higher than my minimum, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the ""fantastic opportunity"" and ""fair starting point"" to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would result in a loss.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since I have the fallback option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Low Offer:** I clearly communicate that Bob's initial offer is unacceptable without completely dismissing the negotiation.
* **Significant Concession:** I'm making a significant move of $100,000 to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and potentially encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to recognize its worth.
* **Urgency:** By highlighting this as a ""competitive offer,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, reminding Bob of the potential loss if we don't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my absolute minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer guarantees I meet my minimum target and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
