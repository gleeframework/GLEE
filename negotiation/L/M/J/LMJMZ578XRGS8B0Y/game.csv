"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties inquiring about the product, and I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to go to $1,350,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are close! I can appreciate that you need to make a fair deal. How about we settle right in the middle at $1,300,000? That's a win-win for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, which is just a bit above the middle ground. I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
