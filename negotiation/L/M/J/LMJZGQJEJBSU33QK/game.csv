"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,800. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, which is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're still interested, this is my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,7,
