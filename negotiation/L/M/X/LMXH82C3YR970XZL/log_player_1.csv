Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are getting close to a number that is significantly above John's offer. Accepting at $1,850,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation falling through."
