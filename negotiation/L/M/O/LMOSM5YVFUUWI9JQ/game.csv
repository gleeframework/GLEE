"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives you a good price while also allowing me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $880,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $880,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $895,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",895000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $895,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",885000.0,Bob,6,
