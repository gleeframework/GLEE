I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $880,000 is closer to my target, I believe I can still get a better price by holding out a bit longer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $880,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $895,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 895000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $895,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd ideally like to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $885,000 is a good deal.  We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  It's better to take the offer and secure the profit than to risk ending up with nothing."
