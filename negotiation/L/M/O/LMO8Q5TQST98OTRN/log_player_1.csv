"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This is to leave room for potential negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to counteroffer, and we can then see where we can meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105, which is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob, while still giving me a decent profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $92 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm hoping that with a clear and firm offer, he will accept.  If he rejects, I'm still comfortable selling to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm confident John will buy the product at my minimum price, which is the best outcome for me."
