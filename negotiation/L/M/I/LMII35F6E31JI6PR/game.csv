"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $125, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer. I'll sell the product to you for $127.50. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",127.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $127.50. I'm willing to go up to $126, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to accept my offer?",126.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to accept your offer of $126. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $128. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",128.0,Alice,5,
