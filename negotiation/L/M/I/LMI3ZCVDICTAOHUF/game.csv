"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While I value your interest, $1200000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1350000. This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
