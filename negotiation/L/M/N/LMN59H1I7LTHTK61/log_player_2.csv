"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Aiming for the Middle:** My goal is to eventually reach a price somewhere between my maximum budget ($800,000) and what seems to be a reasonable starting point for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? I'm confident this price will still be a great deal for you, while also allowing me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At My Limit:** Alice's offer of $800,000 matches my maximum budget. 
* **No Guarantee of Better:** There's no guarantee I can get a better price from Alice, even with more rounds of negotiation.  
* **John's Price is the Same:**  Buying from John would also cost me $800,000.

It makes the most sense to accept Alice's offer now."
