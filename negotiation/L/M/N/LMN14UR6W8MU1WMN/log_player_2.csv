I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.

Bob should buy the product from John. Although Alice has made some concessions, her final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better to buy the product from John and get a guaranteed price that fits his budget."
