Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I'm aiming closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than my minimum ($80). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is framed to assess Bob's interest and encourage a counteroffer if he finds the initial price too high.
* **Backup Option:** I'm aware of John's standing offer ($80), giving me a fallback position if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent profit, I know Bob values the product at $150. There's still room to negotiate for a better price. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm splitting the difference between his offer ($100) and my previous ask ($130). This shows flexibility while still aiming higher. 
* **""Fair Compromise"" Language:**  Framing it as a compromise encourages Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **John as Leverage:** While not explicitly mentioned, John's offer of $80 is in the back of my mind as a potential fallback if negotiations stall."
