"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob is starting with a lower price, aiming to see if Alice is willing to budge. 
* **Message:** Bob acknowledges Alice's enthusiasm but expresses his financial limitations. He emphasizes the value the product has for him, hoping to justify his offer. 

This counteroffer sets a strong starting point for negotiation while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1250000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,250,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price. He can either counteroffer or risk losing the deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I see the value in the product, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is my maximum budget. I believe this price reflects the value to me, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  Bob is now offering his absolute maximum price, leaving no room for further negotiation.  This puts the pressure on Alice to decide.
* **Message:** Bob emphasizes the value of the product but makes it clear that this is his final offer. He also warns that if the deal falls through, he will move on to other options (John). This creates a sense of urgency and could encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1275000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a price of $1270000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While there is a possibility that continued negotiation could lead to a lower price, there's also a risk that Alice might not budge further.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is too high.

Therefore, Bob should take the guaranteed deal with John at $1,200,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially wasting more time on negotiation."
