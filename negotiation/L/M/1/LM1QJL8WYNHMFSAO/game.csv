"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I see the value in the product, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1200000 for it, which is my maximum budget. I believe this price reflects the value to me, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value the product brings to you.",1270000.0,Alice,5,
