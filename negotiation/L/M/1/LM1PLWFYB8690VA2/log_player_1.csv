{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I still get a good return. I'm confident in the value of the product and believe Bob will be motivated to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and gives us both a fair deal.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product holds, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $750,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Although I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk going further down in price and potentially losing out on a better deal.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, so that's the best option at this point."
