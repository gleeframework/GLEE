Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows room for negotiation. 

By starting high, I hope to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he rejects this offer, we can move into a negotiation where I might be willing to come down slightly, but still aim for a price higher than my minimum.  

If Bob rejects my offer and makes a counteroffer that's too low, I have the option to reject it and try again. I also have the safety net of selling to John for $15,000 if I feel the negotiation with Bob isn't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering Bob's willingness to engage in a counteroffer. 

By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. This will allow me to potentially secure a higher price without losing out on the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $18,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I get a price closer to my desired range. 

This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,500 is only $1,500 below my desired minimum.  While it's not ideal, it's still a good deal considering I have the option to sell to John for $15,000. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether, and I'm confident I can secure a better price than John's offer.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
