{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice's offer is $130. This means there's potential to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $135, which is still above your desired price point but lower than John's offer.  Rejecting this offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's still room for improvement, and you haven't yet reached your maximum acceptable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $140, which is getting closer to your maximum price of $150. However, at this point, there's a risk that further negotiation will lead to a price you're not comfortable with. It's safer to buy from John for $150, guaranteeing a price you're willing to pay without risking going over your budget."
