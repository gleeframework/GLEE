{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling pressured.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $12,000 offer allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Protecting Myself:** I'm always aware of my backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.
* **I want to push for a higher price.** By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a higher price and see if I can get him closer to my desired range.
* **John is my safety net.** Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 sale with John gives me the confidence to hold firm and negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to sell it for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $12,000 offer.
* **Still above my minimum:** $10,500 is still well above my minimum of $15,000, so I'm not sacrificing too much.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer gauges Bob's willingness to increase his offer. If he's serious, he should be willing to move closer to $10,500.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still aware of my backup option with John, which gives me the confidence to hold firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just above my minimum of $15,000. It's a fair compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection is not worth it.  It's unlikely Bob will budge much further.
* **Time is money:**  The longer I negotiate, the more time and energy I spend. Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other opportunities. 

Overall, accepting Bob's offer provides me with a decent profit while minimizing the risk of not selling at all or having to sell to John at a lower price."
