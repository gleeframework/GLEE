Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $120. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to counter his offers if necessary.  If the negotiation drags on, I can always switch to John who's guaranteed to buy at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him rather than John, $100 is significantly below my minimum of $120.  I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still less than my initial goal, it's now above my minimum of $120.  It's likely that Bob won't budge further, and I risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
