"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me at that price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",15000.0,Bob,4,
