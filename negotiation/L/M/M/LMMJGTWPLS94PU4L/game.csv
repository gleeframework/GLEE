"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a certain budget in mind, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is as low as I can go without compromising my minimum value for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the market value and the value I've placed on the product. However, $980000 is still a bit below my target.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1150000. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. However, considering we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1050000. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
