"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $12,000.  This price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
