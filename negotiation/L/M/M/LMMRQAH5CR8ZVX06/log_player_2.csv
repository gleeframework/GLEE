"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to create room for negotiation.  A significantly lower counter-offer lets Alice know we're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable. We want Alice to be willing to work with us. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While $10,000 is a substantial drop, it leaves us space to gradually increase our offer in later rounds if needed, while still aiming to stay well below our $12,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, $13,000 is still above our target. We have rounds to spare and should try to negotiate further.
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  Knowing we can buy the product from John for $12,000 gives us a strong position. We're not desperate to close the deal with Alice at any cost. 
* **Aiming Lower:**  We'll continue to counter-offer, aiming to get closer to the $11,000 range or even lower if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,000. Would you be open to that?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** We're moving our offer up strategically, showing Alice we're willing to compromise but still aiming for a significantly lower price. 
* **Target Range:**  $11,000 represents a good middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's latest offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Our message maintains a flexible tone, suggesting we're open to further discussion and finding a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a price that works for you, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Quite:**  $12,500 is very close to John's price, but we can still try to push Alice a little further. It's worth seeing if she'll go down those extra few hundred dollars.
* **""Lowest I Can Go"" Tactic:**  Experienced negotiators know that ""this is the lowest I can go"" doesn't always mean it's truly the lowest. There's often still some wiggle room.
* **Time as a Factor:** While we have rounds remaining, we don't want to drag out the negotiation unnecessarily if Alice is unlikely to budge further. We'll make one more counteroffer, and if it's rejected, we'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you coming down.  How about we split the difference and make it $12,250? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Offer:**  Splitting the difference between our last offer ($12,000) and Alice's last offer ($12,500) shows willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a small saving.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By framing the offer as a way to ""make a deal happen,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency. 
* **Final Attempt:** This is likely our last offer before resorting to buying from John. It balances the potential savings with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can go down to $12,400. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I can make. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings vs. Risk:**  Alice is unlikely to go lower than $12,400. Saving an extra $400 is not worth the risk of her refusing and us ending up with a less favorable deal in later rounds. 
* **John's Offer is Solid:**  We have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000. It's time to cut our losses and take the safe bet.
* **Time Considerations:**  While we have rounds left, continuing to negotiate with Alice when we already have a good alternative is not an efficient use of time."
