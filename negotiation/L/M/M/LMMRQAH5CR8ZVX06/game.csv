"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,000. Would you be open to that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a price that works for you, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let's make this deal happen!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you coming down.  How about we split the difference and make it $12,250? That's a fair deal for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can go down to $12,400. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I can make. What do you say?",12400.0,Alice,7,
