# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. I believe it's a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. Let's discuss!

{""message"": ""I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,400,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1,300,000. This price still offers you a great deal and allows me to cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle.
