"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,400,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1,300,000. This price still offers you a great deal and allows me to cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
