"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I have more rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time I'm setting it at my minimum acceptable price.  I believe that the product is worth this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in it and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, we're running out of rounds and I'm not confident I can get him to agree to my minimum price.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, and it's the most logical choice at this point."
