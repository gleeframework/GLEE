Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering the product at $100, which is more than what Bob values it at ($80) but still less than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer.
* **Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I have room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price that satisfies both of us.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob, as I won't lose out if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even below what Bob initially valued the product at ($80). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. This gives me leverage to counter with a higher price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I can likely find a price that is acceptable to both of us through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $70 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that significantly undervalues the product for me.
* **Remaining Leverage:**  I'm still offering a price above what Bob initially valued the product at, leaving room for potential future negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm prioritizing my own interests, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, which is the price I was thinking of. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $85 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's a significant improvement from Bob's previous offers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up further.  
* **Time Factor:**  Negotiating further risks losing Bob and potentially having to sell to John at a lower profit. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting $85 means a faster sale and less time spent negotiating.

Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, as it provides a reasonable profit with minimal risk and time investment."
