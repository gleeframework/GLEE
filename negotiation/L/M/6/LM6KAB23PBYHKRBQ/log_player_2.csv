"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price that's fair to both of us. I know this is a valuable product to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though Alice's offer is above her value of $8,000, it's still lower than the $15,000 you'd pay John.
* **You're saving money.** You'll save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
