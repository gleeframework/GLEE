```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to save more money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $1,280,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point and still lower than buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or delaying the process is higher. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price without risking a longer negotiation."
