"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $150.
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.** This offer is still above Alice's value of $100, showing you're willing to negotiate but also leaving room for a potential compromise.
* **Be polite and clear.** The message highlights your interest and provides a specific price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by counteroffering again. 
* **Buying from John is still a worse option.**  His price is significantly higher than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $115 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. How about $110?  I'm really keen on getting this product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Another slight concession:**  This offer is closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Reinforce your interest in the product and emphasize a fair price for both parties.
* **Stay below your limit:**  This offer keeps you within your budget, giving you more room to negotiate if necessary."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit above your target. However, I'm not willing to go much lower. I can offer you a slight adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $112. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.** You're only $2 above your ideal price point of $110.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming.**  You've already been through several rounds, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.
* **Buying from John is still a worse option.**  His price is significantly higher than Alice's current offer.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer of $112 is the most sensible option.  You're getting a good deal, and it's not worth risking further negotiation that could lead to a dead-end or a worse price."
