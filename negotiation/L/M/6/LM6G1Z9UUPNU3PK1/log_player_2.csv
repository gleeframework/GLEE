"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  Rejecting allows for the possibility of negotiating a lower price.  You haven't gathered any information about Alice's willingness to lower the price, so it's best to explore your options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price is a common negotiation tactic. This establishes your willingness to negotiate and sets a lower baseline for the price. It's important to be aggressive in the first counteroffer to see how much wiggle room there is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which is a positive sign. However, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue exploring the possibility of getting an even lower price.  By rejecting, you signal that you're not desperate for the product and that you are determined to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, her offer is still above your desired price.  This counteroffer is a step up from your previous offer but still below Alice's latest offer. This shows you are willing to compromise, while also pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and we are now only $250,000 away from your ideal price.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a better deal is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that is within your budget and saves time and energy.  The next few rounds might result in a slightly lower price, but there's no guarantee, and you are approaching your maximum allowable rounds."
