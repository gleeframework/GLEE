{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm confident Bob will find the value worth the extra $10."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
