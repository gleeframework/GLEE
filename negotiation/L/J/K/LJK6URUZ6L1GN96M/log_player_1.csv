Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours before I consider other offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding your minimum price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Limit:**  The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, giving you leverage. Bob doesn't need to know John's exact offer, just that you have other options.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation tactics, you might adjust your approach in subsequent interactions."
