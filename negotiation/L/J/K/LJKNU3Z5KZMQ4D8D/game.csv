"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'd like to propose a compromise at $1600000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1000000. Can you consider this price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from our previous discussions, and I'm starting to get concerned that we may not meet in the middle. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1400000, which is $200000 above your latest offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1400000. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the same price I offered earlier. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
