"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high. Bob's goal is to save money and his maximum budget is $1,200,000. There is no point in accepting this offer. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,900,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,650,000? This acknowledges the product's worth while recognizing your initial offer.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still not a price that Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
