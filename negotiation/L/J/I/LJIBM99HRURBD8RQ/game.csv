"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to your initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I know we're getting close to a deal we can both agree on. How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
