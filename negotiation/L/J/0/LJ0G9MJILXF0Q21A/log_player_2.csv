"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still a significant markup from John's price. It's worth negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $85?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to give us room to negotiate upwards. This approach might encourage Alice to counter quickly if she's genuinely interested in making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to our desired price point, $97.50 is still a bit too high. We are close enough to John's price that it's worth risking another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $97.50 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little steep for me. How about $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a price that works for us while still signaling to Alice that we are serious about buying the product. This approach maintains a balance between negotiating a better deal and potentially losing the opportunity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $95, which is a reasonable compromise. We've saved $5 compared to John's price, and continuing to negotiate might lead Alice to walk away."
