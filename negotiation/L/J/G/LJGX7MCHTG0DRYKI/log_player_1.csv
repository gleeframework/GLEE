"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more substantial saving. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer of $1,200,000. Since this is the minimum you're willing to accept, there's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob. Accepting his offer or trying to haggle further would just be a waste of time and effort. It's best to sell to John and secure the guaranteed price."
