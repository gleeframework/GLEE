"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can come to an agreement that works for both of us. My counteroffer is $95 for the product.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $102.50? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $97 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise given the value of the product.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $99.50. This would mean we each meet halfway from our previous offers. Let's close this deal!",99.5,Alice,5,
