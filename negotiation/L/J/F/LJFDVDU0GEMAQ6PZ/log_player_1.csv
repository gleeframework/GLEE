"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and above Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify the price. 

This strategy aims to:
* Gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.
* Establish a starting point for the negotiation. 
* Leave room for potential concessions later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can come to an agreement that works for both of us. My counteroffer is $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum of $100, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **Exploring the negotiation:** I want to see how far Bob is willing to go and if he's genuinely interested in buying the product.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $102.50? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my previous price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.

This strategy aims to:
*  Show flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
*  Potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.
*  Maintain a positive and constructive tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $97 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum of $100, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Seeking a higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** I want to see if I can secure a higher price, even if it means risking a few more rounds. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially reach a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $99.50. This would mean we each meet halfway from our previous offers. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 99.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's only $0.50 above my minimum, demonstrating a commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Appealing to Reason:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's logic.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we close the deal, pushing Bob to make a decision. 

This strategy aims to:
* **Secure a price close to my minimum:**  I'm  trying to reach a price that's acceptable while staying true to my minimum.
* **Encourage acceptance:** I'm using strong language and emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Minimize further negotiation:**  I hope to close the deal in this round and avoid further back-and-forth."
