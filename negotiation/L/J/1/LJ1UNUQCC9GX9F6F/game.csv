"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $12,500 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,750? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",13750.0,Alice,3,
