Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000), aiming to secure a profit while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $14,000 is a good starting point as it allows for potential counteroffers without compromising my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Framing:** Using a positive and encouraging tone can help build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer of $12,500 falls short of my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **I have a backup option:**  I can sell to John for $15,000, making Bob's offer less appealing. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $12,500 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,750? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Remaining Firm on Minimum:** While offering a concession, I'm still above my minimum value of $15,000, ensuring I get a decent price.
* **Appealing to Fair Play:** Suggesting a ""fair price"" for both parties can be persuasive. 
* **Leaving Room for Acceptance:**  $13,750 gives Bob some wiggle room to accept, without having to budge too much from his offer."
