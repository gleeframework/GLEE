(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $14000?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $14,000 is still outside my budget. I will continue to negotiate, but will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which is a fair compromise. If you're willing to consider this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  $10000 is a fair offer, but I need to be a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $12000? This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to my fallback option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer you the product for $11500. This is a good price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than my comfort zone, and we're running out of rounds. At this point, I'm better off buying from John for $8,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget.  It's a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
