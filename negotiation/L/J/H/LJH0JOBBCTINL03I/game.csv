"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $140 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $155? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get the product without breaking the bank.",150.0,Bob,4,
