"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase today.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, $10500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more. How about we discuss $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $11500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try $11000 - that would be a good compromise and allow us both to make a deal today.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
