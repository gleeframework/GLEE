"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than you'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me, though. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
