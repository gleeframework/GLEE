Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about $13,500? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While Bob is getting closer, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'll counter with a price a bit closer to my desired amount."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $12500? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're close to the middle ground now, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get much more out of him.  It's better to take the $12,500 than risk going back and forth and potentially ending up with John's offer of $10,000."
