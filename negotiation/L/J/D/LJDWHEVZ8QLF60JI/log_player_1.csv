Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, you can adjust your strategy accordingly.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $100. This provides a safety net, allowing you to be more confident in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. We started high, and it's reasonable to expect some back and forth. By immediately accepting his first counteroffer, we might be leaving money on the table. We'll try to nudge him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we're signaling a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $125 still represents a significant profit margin above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room:** There's still a little wiggle room in case Bob wants to negotiate further, but we're moving closer to a price that likely works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about $110?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $110 is a solid profit margin, representing a 10% gain over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental increases. It's unlikely Bob will suddenly jump to $120 or higher.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting a good offer now allows us to move on to other potential deals or tasks. 

While we could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and the relatively small potential gain make $110 a reasonable point to accept."
