{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above my maximum budget of $800,000.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $950,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it brings us closer to finding common ground.

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  I still believe there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. How about $900,000?

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This offers you a great value, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is a better offer than before, it's still outside my budget.  I'll try to counteroffer one more time before exploring the option of buying from John. I believe there's still potential to reach a deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $910,000, which reflects a significant value for both of us.  Let's reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $910,000 is not quite where I'd like to be, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's finalize this deal at $915,000. It's a good price for both of us and allows us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my maximum limit.  I've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems we're at a stalemate. To avoid further negotiation, and to ensure I acquire the product within my budget, I'll choose to buy it from John for $800,000. This guarantees a successful purchase and minimizes the risk of going over my financial limit."
