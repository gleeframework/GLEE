"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $950,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it brings us closer to finding common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. How about $900,000? This is a fair price that allows me to stay within my budget and provides you with a significant return on your investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This offers you a great value, and we can finally close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $910,000, which reflects a significant value for both of us.  Let's reach a final agreement.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $910,000 is not quite where I'd like to be, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's finalize this deal at $915,000. It's a good price for both of us and allows us to move forward.",915000.0,Alice,7,
