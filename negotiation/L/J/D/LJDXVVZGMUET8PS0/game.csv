"Alice, your product seems great, but $18000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is simply too low for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also being within your budget. Let's make this deal happen!",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $15000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,
