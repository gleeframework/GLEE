"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems great, but $18000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also being within your budget. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $15000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'm going to have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob seems firm on his $12,000 offer, and I've already lowered my price twice. It's unlikely he'll budge further, and I risk wasting more rounds.  Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I get my minimum and don't risk losing out on the deal entirely."
