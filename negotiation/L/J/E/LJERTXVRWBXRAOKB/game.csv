"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a fair price considering its worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12500. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $12500 is still quite a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $14000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
