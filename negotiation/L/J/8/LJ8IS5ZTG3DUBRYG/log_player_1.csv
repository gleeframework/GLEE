Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price like $150 gives Alice the opportunity to potentially earn a significant profit. While it's higher than Bob's perceived value, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if the product solves a specific need or he's motivated to buy. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial price, it opens the door for negotiation. Alice can always lower the price slightly if needed.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  Alice has a safety net with John who will buy the product for $100. This means she doesn't *have* to go below that price with Bob."
