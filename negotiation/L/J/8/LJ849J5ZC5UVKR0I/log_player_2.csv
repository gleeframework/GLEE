"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her or simply go with John if she doesn't budge. You have a potential $500 saving at stake."
