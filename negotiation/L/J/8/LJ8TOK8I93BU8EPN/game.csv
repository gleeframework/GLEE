"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend less than $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $950,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,050,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is still a good price considering its value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
