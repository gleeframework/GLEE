"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have some reservations about the price, but I'm confident the product will bring you significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify a price above $800,000. I'm willing to offer that, but I can't go any higher.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000, as it's worth at least $800,000 to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is my final compromise.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be honest, $950,000 is a tough pill to swallow. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $875,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $875,000. I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to see a stronger commitment from you. I'm offering the product to you for $980,000. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me here.",980000.0,Alice,7,
