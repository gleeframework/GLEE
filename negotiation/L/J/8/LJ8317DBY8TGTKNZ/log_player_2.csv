# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room to save more money before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. Considering your offer, I'll make a new counteroffer. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is my original offer plus a small adjustment to show I'm willing to be flexible. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a deal at this price.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he would prefer a lower price, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and her offer is close to his ideal price.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.  This offer is a good compromise that saves Bob significant money compared to John's price."
