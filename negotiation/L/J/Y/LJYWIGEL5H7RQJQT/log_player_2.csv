(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to maximize his savings, so he starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This price is still within his budget and gives Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since he has a guaranteed option to purchase from John for $10,000, Bob chooses to buy from John to ensure he stays within his budget."
