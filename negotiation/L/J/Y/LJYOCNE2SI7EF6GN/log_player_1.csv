Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" Alice provides a subtle justification for the price, even if Bob isn't privy to the specifics.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The tone is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), inviting Bob to counter-offer and revealing how interested he truly is.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so she's not risking a complete loss.
* **Information is Key:**  In a real negotiation, understanding Bob's needs and priorities would be crucial to tailor the offer more effectively."
