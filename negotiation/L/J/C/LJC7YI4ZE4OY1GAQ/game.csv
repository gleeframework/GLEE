"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. This still keeps my budget in check while acknowledging the value of the product. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with a price of $102.5 for the product. This keeps my budget intact while acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",102.5,Bob,6,
