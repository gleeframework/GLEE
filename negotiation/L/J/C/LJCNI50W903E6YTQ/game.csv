"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I believe you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $600,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to you. What do you say?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $550,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $525,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $525,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $530,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",530000.0,Alice,5,
