"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $200 and $120, which would be $160. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $140, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you $150, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $150, which would be $145. Can you consider that?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $150, Bob. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. However, I'm willing to give you a small concession. I can offer you $149, which is the closest I can get to $150. What do you think?",149.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the concession, but $149 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $140, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Please consider it.",140.0,Bob,8,
