"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's desired price point of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I can't go that low just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great value for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $135 is still within Bob's desired price range of $150.
* **Potential for Saving:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time:**  It's only the third round, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a fair price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
