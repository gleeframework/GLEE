"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation tactic - start with a low offer that is significantly below your true maximum price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to your budget, it's still above what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're moving closer to your $80 limit, but there's still a chance Alice might go lower.  This offer shows you're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $75, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $92? It's a good price for both of us, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $80. You'll save money and avoid further negotiation."
