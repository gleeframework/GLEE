"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1200000 to you. Let's start the negotiation with a good price.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1050000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which still leaves you with a significant profit. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1075000, which is a fair compromise and still leaves you with a good profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $1075000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1087500. This leaves both of us with a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
