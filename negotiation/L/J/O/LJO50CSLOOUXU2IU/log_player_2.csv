"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1200000 to you. Let's start the negotiation with a good price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than your maximum, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds, so there's no need to rush into accepting the first offer.
* **Counteroffers are possible:** You can make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further.

By rejecting the offer, you open the door for further negotiation and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1050000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which still leaves you with a significant profit. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above what you're willing to pay at this point.
* **You have more rounds:** There's no need to rush into accepting an offer that isn't ideal. You have time to see if Alice will come down further.
* **The goal is to save money:** By rejecting and continuing to negotiate, you're increasing the chances of getting the product at a lower price. 

You can use the next round to counter with a slightly higher price, but still below $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise and still leaves you with a good profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $1075000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1087500. This leaves both of us with a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,087,500 is well below your maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Significant savings:** You've already saved $112,500 from Alice's initial offer of $1,150,000.
* **Limited time:**  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might harden her position or you could run out of rounds.

While you could potentially try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal or needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slight additional discount."
