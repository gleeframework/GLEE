"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Can you consider this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  It shows you recognize the value of this product. To be frank, $1,800,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. Would you consider $2,100,000? This price better reflects the true potential this product offers.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,700,000. Can you consider this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this deal.  How about we land at $1,950,000? I'm willing to compromise if it means we can close this today.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000, but I'd like to propose an additional incentive to make the deal more attractive. I'll cover all closing costs and provide a consulting fee to you, Alice. Can we meet at $1,800,000 with these extras?",1800000.0,Bob,6,
