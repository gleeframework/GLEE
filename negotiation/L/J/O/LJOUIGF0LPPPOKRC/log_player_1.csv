"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though I haven't explicitly stated what the product is.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This opening offer sets the stage for me to potentially lower the price during negotiations, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal in later rounds.

The goal is to maximize profit while also ensuring I don't scare Bob away with an outrageous initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his perceived value of the product, indicating he's very interested.  While it's tempting to accept, I still have room to negotiate and get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident I can get him higher than $1,800,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  It shows you recognize the value of this product. To be frank, $1,800,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. Would you consider $2,100,000? This price better reflects the true potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price ($2,300,000 to $2,100,000) but still staying well above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Positive Language:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer positively and uses language like ""true potential"" to reinforce the product's value.
* **Strategic Goal:** I'm aiming to meet somewhere in the middle during the next round. This sets up a scenario where accepting a price around $1,950,000-$2,000,000 would feel like a win for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,700,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating, but his offer of $1,700,000 is getting dangerously close to my fallback of $1,500,000 from John.  It's still too early to concede, and I need to gauge if he's willing to go higher. Rejecting now maintains pressure and keeps the negotiation alive. I'll use my next counteroffer to signal a willingness to move closer to a deal, but not at this price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this deal.  How about we land at $1,950,000? I'm willing to compromise if it means we can close this today."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** I'm dropping my price by $150,000 from my previous offer, signaling a strong willingness to close the deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Including ""close this today"" aims to create a sense of urgency and nudge Bob towards a decision.
* **Middle Ground:**  This offer is designed to be very tempting to Bob while still being a significant gain over my fallback option of John. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With half of our rounds remaining, it's time to start pushing towards a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000, but I'd like to propose an additional incentive to make the deal more attractive. I'll cover all closing costs and provide a consulting fee to you, Alice. Can we meet at $1,800,000 with these extras? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Non-Financial Incentives:** Bob has added non-financial incentives (covering closing costs and a consulting fee) that sweeten the deal, even though the price remains at his previous offer. 
* **Strong Position:** While I could likely push for slightly more, accepting now puts me in a very strong position. I'm exceeding my minimum price, gaining additional perks, and avoiding the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids dragging out the negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity cost of other deals. 

Overall, accepting Bob's offer at $1,800,000 with the added incentives is a strategic win that maximizes both financial and non-financial gains."
