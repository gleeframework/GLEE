"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $950,000? This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
