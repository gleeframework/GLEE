"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $7,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $7,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $6,700?",6700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a good deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $7,200. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good balance between our prices. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,900 to try and find a compromise.  Do you think that would work?",6900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $6,900. I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm counteroffering at $7,100. It's my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",7100.0,Alice,7,
