"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a high starting point to maximize potential profit, while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first offer.  I believe there's room for a higher price, and I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with $150. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe there's a possibility to get closer to my target price, and I'm willing to try one more round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to offer $140. This is a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, and I hope it will be enough to reach an agreement. I'm also aware that we're approaching the middle of our negotiation rounds, so it's important to start closing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close to my minimum and I'm running out of negotiation rounds. It's better to secure a sale at a price slightly above my minimum than risk losing the sale altogether."
