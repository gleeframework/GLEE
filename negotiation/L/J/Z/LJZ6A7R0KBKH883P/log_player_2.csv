**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though Alice's price is higher than her value for the product ($12,000 vs. $10,000), it's still lower than what John would charge ($15,000).
* **You're saving money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John."
