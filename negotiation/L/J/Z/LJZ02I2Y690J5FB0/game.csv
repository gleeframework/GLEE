"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1280000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1500000.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
