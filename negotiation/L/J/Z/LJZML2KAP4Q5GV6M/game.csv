"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is quite significant, and $16,000 is below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $12,000. Can you consider this offer?",17000.0,Bob,4,
