"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm happy to make you a special offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll really appreciate the extra $6,000 worth of value you'll get with this purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers.  There's no point in negotiating with Alice when you have a better option readily available."
