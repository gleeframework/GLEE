"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the unique features of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1100000. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to pay $980000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the time and effort we've invested in this conversation, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1020000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually acceptable price. However, I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, which is the same price I offered in Round 5. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're at a critical point in the negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to make one last attempt to find a mutually acceptable price.
