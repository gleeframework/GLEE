Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly approach:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's worth to Bob without explicitly stating it. 

This approach allows for potential negotiation while ensuring I start with a good price. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate. I'd like to try and push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's message indicates he's genuinely interested and willing to negotiate, suggesting a potential for a higher price than $90.
* **Risk assessment:**  Selling to John for $80 is my fallback, but it's less profitable than potentially securing a higher price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and see if I can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a fair price for this product, and it's closer to your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive language:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's worth by mentioning it's a ""fair price.""

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still leaving a bit of room for further negotiation if needed.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll reconsider selling to John or making another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  Bob's offer of $92.5 is very close to my desired price range.  
* **Limited upside:**  There's a limited chance of getting a significantly higher price from Bob. He's stated his bottom line, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Selling to John for $80 is a safe option, but it's less profitable than accepting Bob's offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing a buyer. It's a good compromise that secures a good deal."
