"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. It's always worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further bargaining if Alice counters. You're aiming for a price closer to the product's value to her while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130?  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $130, which is a good compromise. This price is within your budget and allows you to get the product for a price lower than John's.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice might not budge further. It's better to secure the product at this price than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price."
