"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly less than my original price. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and make it $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
