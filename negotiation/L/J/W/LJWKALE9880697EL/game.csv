"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This is a good price for both of us and allows for a fair deal.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's close this now.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
