"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still not the best possible deal.  There are 9 rounds left to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to compromise a bit to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
