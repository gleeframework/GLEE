Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,000 is my absolute minimum.  This price is still well below what the product is worth to you, and it allows us to finalize this deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's a good deal for you.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a lower price, so it's best to accept."
