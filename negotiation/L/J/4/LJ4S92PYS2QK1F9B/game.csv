"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, I can't go any lower than $135. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I've already lowered my price significantly. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",135.0,Alice,5,
