{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you'd love. I'm thinking $175 would be a fair price, given its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message, hoping to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $140 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject Bob's offer and try one more time to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, I can't go any lower than $135. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I've already lowered my price significantly. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'll take John's offer of $150 to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
