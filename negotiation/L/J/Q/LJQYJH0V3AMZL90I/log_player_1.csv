Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of what it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still leaves room for Bob to see value. It's significantly less than our minimum but still a substantial gain.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: This phrasing adds a sense of urgency and desirability, potentially swaying Bob. 

**Important Note:** This assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond the product's value to him."
