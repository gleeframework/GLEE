"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase a high-quality item at a competitive price. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than our budget to give us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, we're attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to our desired range. Alice is more likely to make concessions if she thinks we're starting from a much lower point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice is coming down, $100 is still above your $80 maximum budget. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  Her willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's more room for negotiation.  

Let's see if we can get Alice to move closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $100 is closer, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer, but staying well below our $80 maximum. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but are holding firm on our budget.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** $75 is a significant jump from our previous offer of $60,  potentially enticing Alice while still leaving us room to negotiate slightly higher if needed.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The tone remains respectful and appreciative of Alice's concessions, which helps foster a positive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, I can make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice has met our maximum budget of $80.
* **No Benefit to Further Negotiation:**  There's no point in trying to negotiate further, as we already have the best possible price from John as a backup. 
* **Secure the Deal:**  Accepting now ensures we get the product at the best price available."
