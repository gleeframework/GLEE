"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. Considering its exceptional value and the benefits it offers, I would like to propose a price of $95 for it. This price reflects the product's worth while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. I believe this offer will be mutually beneficial. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is better than John's price of $80, Bob can likely negotiate a better deal with Alice.  He's willing to pay up to $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the details you provided about the product. While I am interested, $95 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
