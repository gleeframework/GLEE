"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the details you provided about the product. While I am interested, $95 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
