"I'm very interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $750000 is a significant amount, it falls short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price considering the unique value and potential of this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
