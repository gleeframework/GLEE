"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident it will be worth more than the asking price in the long run. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for my target price, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still provides you with a valuable asset. Let's find common ground to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,700,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his final offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 6 more rounds and the option to sell to John for my target price, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. There's a good chance that Bob will increase his offer further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it would be a win-win for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I think $1,300,000 is a fair price for the product. I hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price of $1,300,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have only 4 rounds left, and I'm not confident that Bob will increase his offer further. It's better to sell to John at my target price than to risk a lower sale or a stalemate with Bob."
