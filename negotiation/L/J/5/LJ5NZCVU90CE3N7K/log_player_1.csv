Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a high but slightly negotiable price, Alice encourages Bob to consider the deal seriously. The message implies she's offering a premium product.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob could counter-offer. This leaves Alice the option to slightly reduce the price (e.g., to $14,500) and still make a significant profit compared to selling to John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact willingness to pay beyond the $10,000 estimate."
