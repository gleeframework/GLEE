Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't let this go for less than $160. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has stated this is her final offer and it's still above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go lower and you're better off securing the product at a price you know works."
