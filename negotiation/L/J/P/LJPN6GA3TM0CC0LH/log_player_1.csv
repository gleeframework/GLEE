"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, closer to my ideal price point. This gives me more room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify my asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still rounds left. I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to gauge his seriousness and potentially push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product for you, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I'm lowering my price to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that this price is still advantageous for him.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away or his counteroffer could be even lower.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 4, and I want to maximize my profit within the remaining rounds. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's better to secure a decent profit than risk getting a lower offer or losing the deal altogether."
