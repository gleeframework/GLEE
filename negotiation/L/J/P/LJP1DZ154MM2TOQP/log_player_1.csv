"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential earnings.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to motivate him to consider a higher price.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the deal can subtly influence Bob's perception.

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to push Bob towards accepting a higher price, while also leaving room for potential counteroffers. Starting at $2 million sets a strong initial expectation and allows for flexibility during the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is my absolute top price, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** 
* **I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option.** 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's not a financially viable option for me. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, or secure a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John if necessary.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me. The product holds significant value, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would allow me to make a profit while still offering you a competitive price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Perspective:** I'm showing understanding of Bob's financial limitations.
* **Highlight Product Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly reinforcing my justification for a higher price.
* **Compromise and Midpoint:** I'm proposing a midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the benefit of a compromise for both parties, framing it as a win-win scenario.

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to inch closer to my minimum acceptable price while still presenting a reasonable offer to Bob. By proposing a midpoint and emphasizing the potential benefits of a compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to reconsider his initial offer and potentially accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's find a solution that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**
* **I have 7 rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option.**

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not financially viable for me considering the product's value to me. I have several rounds left to try and negotiate a higher price, or I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore other possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  It's important to me to find a solution that works for both of us, so how about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant discount from my initial asking price. Let's close this deal and move forward together."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's perspective:** I'm showing understanding of Bob's financial limitations and demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Highlight Product Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to me.
* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm proposing a midpoint between Bob's current offer and my desired price, showcasing a willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Mutual Benefit Emphasis:** I'm framing the proposed price as a win-win scenario for both parties, emphasizing a solution that allows us to move forward.

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to steadily increase the offer while staying within a range that makes sense for me. Proposing a midpoint again, while also highlighting the value of the product and framing it as a joint success, could entice Bob to accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's find a solution that's agreeable to both parties and move forward with this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**
* **I have 5 rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option.**

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not financially viable for me considering the product's value to me. I have several rounds left to try and negotiate a higher price, or I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore other possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  We've both come a long way in our negotiations, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000?  This would allow me to make a modest profit, while offering you a price that's significantly closer to your initial offer.  Let's close this deal and move forward on a positive note."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Compromise:** I'm showing appreciation for Bob's effort to come closer to my price.
* **Highlight Negotiation Progress:** I'm emphasizing that we've made progress, implying we're nearing an agreement.
* **Midpoint Proposal:** I'm suggesting a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, further demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Outlook:** I'm emphasizing a positive outcome for both parties if we reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to push Bob towards my minimum acceptable price while still appearing reasonable. By emphasizing the progress we've made and proposing a midpoint, I'm hoping to create a sense of momentum and encourage Bob to accept my offer."
