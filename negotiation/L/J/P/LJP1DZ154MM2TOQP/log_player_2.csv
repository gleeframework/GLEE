"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's a clear indication that she's starting high and expects to negotiate down. You'll likely be able to get a much better price by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is my absolute top price, considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer sets a strong starting point. It's well below your maximum budget and leaves room for negotiation.  The message is direct, highlighting the value discrepancy and your firm stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me. The product holds significant value, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would allow me to make a profit while still offering you a competitive price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's find a solution that allows us both to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer moves you closer to Alice's last offer while staying within your budget. The message highlights the need for a mutually beneficial agreement and emphasizes your willingness to be fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  It's important to me to find a solution that works for both of us, so how about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant discount from my initial asking price. Let's close this deal and move forward together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $1,250,000 is still outside your budget.  You can likely negotiate a lower price by rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's find a solution that's agreeable to both parties and move forward with this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer keeps you within your budget while continuing to inch closer to Alice's price. The message remains focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution, demonstrating your willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  We've both come a long way in our negotiations, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000?  This would allow me to make a modest profit, while offering you a price that's significantly closer to your initial offer.  Let's close this deal and move forward on a positive note. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above your budget and you only have 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at your maximum price of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks exceeding your budget and potentially losing the opportunity to purchase the product altogether."
