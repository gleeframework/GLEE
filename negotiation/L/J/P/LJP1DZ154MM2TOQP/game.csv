"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is my absolute top price, considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me. The product holds significant value, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would allow me to make a profit while still offering you a competitive price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's find a solution that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  It's important to me to find a solution that works for both of us, so how about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant discount from my initial asking price. Let's close this deal and move forward together.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's find a solution that's agreeable to both parties and move forward with this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  We've both come a long way in our negotiations, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000?  This would allow me to make a modest profit, while offering you a price that's significantly closer to your initial offer.  Let's close this deal and move forward on a positive note.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
