"I appreciate your offer, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,700,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
