You have three options:

You can do better than $100.  Let's see if Alice will negotiate."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it."", ""product_price"": 85}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's still a good deal for you and gets us closer to a deal.

$92.5 is still more than I'd like to pay.  Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more."
