"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know the value is worth much more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point that reflects my goal of maximizing profit while still potentially appealing to Bob. I'm offering a discount but not a massive one, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 9 rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is tempting, it's still not quite where I need to be.  How about $11,500?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 6 rounds left and John is willing to pay my minimum price.  I'm going to try and see if I can get Bob closer to my target in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping for something a bit closer to $12,000. How about we split the difference at $11,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $11,000.  This is a fair price that's within both of our budgets, and I believe it's in our best interest to close this deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob isn't getting me closer to my target price. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for $15,000. It's the best offer I have, and it meets my minimum price requirement."
