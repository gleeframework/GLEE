,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is tempting, it's still not quite where I need to be.  How about $11,500?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping for something a bit closer to $12,000. How about we split the difference at $11,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $11,000.  This is a fair price that's within both of our budgets, and I believe it's in our best interest to close this deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",11000.0,Bob,6,
