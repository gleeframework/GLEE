# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to consider this offer. We're offering the product for $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $1,200,000, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if I can get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still not ready to accept it.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price and stay within my budget.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $800,000 if necessary."

While Alice has lowered her price to $850,000, which is closer to my budget, I am still going to reject the offer and try to get a better price. John is willing to sell for $800,000, so I have a solid backup option if negotiations with Alice don't go my way."
