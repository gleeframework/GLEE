Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm starting the bidding at $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to try and make this work.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product, while also being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1200000 is closer to what I'm looking to spend, I still feel it's a bit high. Could you consider $950000 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still feel it's too low. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that takes both of our needs into account."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with $1025000 as a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price and selling to John would only get me $1,000,000. I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
