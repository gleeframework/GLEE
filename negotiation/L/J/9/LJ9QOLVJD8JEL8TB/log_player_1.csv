"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's a large gap for us to work with. This offer might be a bit high, but I want to see how Bob reacts before going lower."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I believe I have some room for negotiation as Bob seems interested and willing to engage."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm not desperate to sell and have a backup option with John.

{""product_price"": 1450000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While Bob is showing some willingness to move up, we're still far apart. It's clear that Bob is not likely to meet my minimum price. To avoid further time-consuming negotiations, I'm choosing to sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum and secure a deal."
