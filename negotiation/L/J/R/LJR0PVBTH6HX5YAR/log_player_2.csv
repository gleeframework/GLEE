# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued interest. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a substantial difference from my valuation. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
