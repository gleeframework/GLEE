"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,000?  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the offer of $9,000. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. How about $11,000? This would represent a significant value for you and allow me to get closer to my goal. Let's keep this conversation going and see if we can find a win-win solution.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While $11,000 is still a bit too high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit higher. How about $10,500?  This would be a significant value for you and allow me to achieve my goal.  We're getting closer, and I think we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is a fair compromise, and if we can't agree on this, I might need to explore other options.  Let's try to make this happen.",9750.0,Bob,8,
