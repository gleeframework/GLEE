"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also clearly conveys my desire to sell to him, while also setting a high bar for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we discuss $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of your product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for $1,050,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Time is of the essence, and I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. Considering the value of your product, I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiation with Bob has stalled. While I am still hopeful that we could reach a deal, I am not sure if we will be able to agree on a price within the remaining rounds.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is above Bob's current offer, I will choose to sell the product to John and secure the deal."
