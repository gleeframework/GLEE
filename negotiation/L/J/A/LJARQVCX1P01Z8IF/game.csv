"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This reflects a significant investment on my part.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $1,000,000? This would represent a more agreeable middle ground for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which represents a fair price for both of us. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the product's value.",975000.0,Alice,5,
