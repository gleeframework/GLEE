I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation.  I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This is my bottom line, as it's the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product.  I'm confident this is still a fair price, given the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'd rather sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
