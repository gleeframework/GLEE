"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your specific needs and expectations. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000. This is a great opportunity to secure an item that is worth $12,000 to you at a competitive rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to adjust my offer accordingly. Considering the value of the product to you, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. While Bob could potentially get a lower price, it's only $500 less than his counteroffer.  Considering there are only 7 rounds left, it's a reasonable risk to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that is still significantly less than John's offer."
