Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,200,000) but still above Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect. This can make Bob more receptive.

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a relatively high offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's space for negotiation as the price is below my minimum but above Bob's valuation.
* **Staying Flexible:** If Bob rejects, I'll consider counteroffers and can always fallback to selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about if I offer to purchase the product for $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired amount. I believe there's room for further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm confident that I can get closer to $1,000,000 or even higher with another counteroffer. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, I'm not willing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob yet. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to stay in control of the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about we settle on $975,000? This would still be a great deal for you and would allow me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still significantly less than my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm again framing the offer as a win-win situation and highlighting the ""great deal"" for Bob. I'm also subtly emphasizing my need to get closer to my desired price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Flexible:**  I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm slowly increasing the price to test the waters.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** I want to keep the negotiation moving and avoid reaching a stalemate where Bob might completely walk away.
* **Setting a Limit:** $975,000 is a price I'm comfortable with, and I'm likely to accept anything above it. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll probably make one final counteroffer before selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about considering $960,000 as the final price for the product? This still allows you to earn more than your initial offer, while I am able to stick closely to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $975,000. While I would prefer to get even closer to my desired $1,000,000, I believe accepting this offer is the best option at this point. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Risk:**  The risk of further negotiation could lead to Bob walking away entirely or me having to accept a lower price if he makes a counteroffer.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  While $960,000 is not ideal, it's a good compromise that satisfies both our needs to a certain extent."
