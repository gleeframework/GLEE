Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, so I'm not losing money if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and encourages Bob to see the value in the offer. 

**Next steps:** 

I'll be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering my price slightly, but I'll always keep my minimum in mind and the option to sell to John at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. I can offer a counter-proposal that's closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a better price.

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my $1,200,000 asking price. I'll also keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as my ultimate fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and provides you with a fair deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain leverage:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, this price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $900,000. 
* **Reasonable middle ground:**  This price represents a potential middle ground that could be appealing to Bob. 
* **Emphasis on value:** My message reiterates the product's value, reminding Bob that this offer is still beneficial for him. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm prepared to continue negotiating with Bob if needed. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to make a further concession or to accept John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'm willing to make a final concession but not go below my minimum.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that is as close to my minimum as possible. If he rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This price still represents a good value for you, and it's the final offer I'm able to make. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:**  This counteroffer represents my final concession. I'm bringing my price down to $1,000,000, which is the closest I can get to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Emphasis on finality:** My message clearly states that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Positive framing:**  While acknowledging that this is a lower price, I'm still framing it as a good value for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately sell the product to John for $1,500,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000, and I want to ensure that I get the best possible price for my product."
