,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and provides you with a fair deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This price still represents a good value for you, and it's the final offer I'm able to make. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
