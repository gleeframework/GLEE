Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit above my ideal range.  Let's see if we can meet at $1,100,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and for you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. This is my final offer in this range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within my budget of $1,500,000 and is only $20,000 above my last counteroffer.  It's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a lower price, and it's still a good deal for me compared to buying from John.  I'm accepting the offer."
