Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate down, but I'm aiming for the highest possible profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I want to leave room for negotiation, but I need to ensure I get a price that's worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just below my minimum, but I'm feeling the pressure to close the deal.  I'm choosing to accept his offer and sell for $1,400,000. While it's not ideal, it's still a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
