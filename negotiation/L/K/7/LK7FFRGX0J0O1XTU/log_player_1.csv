Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies it's worth a significant amount.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and the message ends with ""Let me know what you think!"",  showing you are open to discussing the price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:**  If Bob accepts the $10,000, you earn more than your minimum.
2. **Secure a sale:** Even if Bob negotiates, you have a cushion to lower the price while still staying above your $8,000 minimum.  

Worst case scenario, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000."
