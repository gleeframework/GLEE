"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is still below the product's value to Bob ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Friendly opening:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to discuss the price. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I don't want to immediately go for the maximum profit. I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. 
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob is clearly interested, so there's a chance I can push him closer to my original $100 price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding the John offer:**  $90 is significantly better than the $80 John would pay.  There's still potential to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I provide a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $95 is still well above my minimum price of $80, so I'm not losing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $92 is very close to my original $100 asking price, and significantly better than the $80 John would pay.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** There is a risk that Bob will keep lowering his offer, and I might end up selling to John for $80 if I keep rejecting.
* **Time constraint:**  We're already on round 4, and the clock is ticking.  Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and a quick sale."
