It's too early to accept. You have 9 more rounds to negotiate and potentially save a lot of money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  It's half of her original price, which is a significant discount. I'm hoping she will at least consider it and we can continue negotiating from there."

Alice has come down slightly, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get her even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}

I'm going to offer $300,000. This is still a significant discount from her last offer and might be more appealing to her than my previous counteroffer. If she rejects, I'll consider going closer to her offer in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my preferred price point.  However, I still want to see if I can get her to go lower. There are still rounds left, so I'm not ready to commit just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. We are getting closer, and I think there's a good chance she will accept this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I still believe we can reach a better agreement. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $400,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and hopefully, it will convince Alice to accept. If she doesn't, I might have to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I think it's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  Alice is back to her original price, and I'm out of time to negotiate further. I've reached my limit with the counteroffers, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a higher price."
