Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're not selling yourself short and are still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  It gives Bob a potential gain, making him more likely to accept.
* **It's a clear, concise message:**  Bob knows exactly what you're offering. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with $105. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $95 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and we've been going back and forth for a few rounds now.  It's time to finalize the deal."
