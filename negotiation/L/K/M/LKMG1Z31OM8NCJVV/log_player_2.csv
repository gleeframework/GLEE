You have three options:

You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  You value the product at $12,000, and Alice's offer is higher than what it's worth to her. There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.

You're still better off rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer. While $10,500 is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially save money by negotiating further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's still a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

While you can continue negotiating with Alice, it's unlikely you'll get a price lower than $11,000. It's becoming increasingly clear that Alice is unwilling to budge much further. Buying from John for $12,000 is still a better option than accepting Alice's offer and paying $11,000. You can save $1,000 by going with John."
