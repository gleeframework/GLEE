"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll see the tremendous potential it holds. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
