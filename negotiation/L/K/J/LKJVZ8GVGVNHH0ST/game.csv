"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, maybe around $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we try $90? That's a fair bit closer to my budget.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $100. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this!",100.0,Alice,7,
