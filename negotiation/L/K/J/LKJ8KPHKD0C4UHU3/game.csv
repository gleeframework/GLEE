"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $975,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could make a decision",950000.0,Alice,5,
