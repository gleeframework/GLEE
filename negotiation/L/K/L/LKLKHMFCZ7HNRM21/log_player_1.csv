{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but it also leaves potential for Bob to counteroffer, giving us a chance to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 as a final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and is a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's offer. It leaves little room for further negotiation, which may prompt Bob to accept or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10500 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I've already made significant concessions and his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. To ensure I get the best possible price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
