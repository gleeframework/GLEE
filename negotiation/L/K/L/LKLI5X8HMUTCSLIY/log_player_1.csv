Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I make a profit if he accepts. 
* **Time Value:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer (John), selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and ensures I get paid sooner.

This strategy balances risk and reward by aiming high but leaving room for a deal that benefits both parties."
