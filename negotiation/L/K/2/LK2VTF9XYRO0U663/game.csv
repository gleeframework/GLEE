"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your offer of $900,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $975,000, I'll reduce the price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,012,500. I'll make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
