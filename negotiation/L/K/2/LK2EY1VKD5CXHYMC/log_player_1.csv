"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget and I'm trying to save as much money as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
