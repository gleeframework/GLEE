{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting at $1,400,000 creates a significant perceived value. He might be willing to pay a premium above his own valuation for a product he deems valuable.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without prolonged negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** You have the security of John's offer, providing leverage in your negotiation with Bob.  

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes some flexibility on Bob's part and that he might be willing to pay above his initial valuation."
