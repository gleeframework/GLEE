"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $120, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $130 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $135?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
  
Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget and a good deal. I'd rather not risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal, especially since I can always buy from John if necessary."
