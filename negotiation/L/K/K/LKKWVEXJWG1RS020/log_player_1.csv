Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The mention of ""other interested parties"" subtly reminds Bob that he's not the only option, increasing the perceived value and urgency.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  We know John will buy the product for $1,200,000,  so any offer above that is already profitable for Alice."
