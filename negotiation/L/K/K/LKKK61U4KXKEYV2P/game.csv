"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 5-year warranty. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
