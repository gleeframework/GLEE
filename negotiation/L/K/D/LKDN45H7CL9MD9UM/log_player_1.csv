"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a great opportunity to own a valuable asset.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it might be rejected. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game.  I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and potentially encourage him to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm also emphasizing the value the product offers Bob to incentivize him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still outside my budget, but I'm prepared to offer $1400000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price without pushing Bob away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm still needing a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000, which is just $50,000 above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a genuine desire to close the deal.  I'm also emphasizing that this price allows me to meet my minimum requirements, making it feel more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're very close now. I'm prepared to offer $1500000, which is my absolute maximum. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to conclude this deal. I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I would have loved to get more, it's clear that Bob is not willing to budge further. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and secure my desired minimum.  It's also a good deal for Bob as he gets the product at a price he is comfortable with."
