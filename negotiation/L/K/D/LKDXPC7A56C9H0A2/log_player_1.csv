"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, but still secures a significant profit for me.  I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for the minimum. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point, especially considering his eagerness to buy the product. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a comfortable profit margin. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to settle for such a significant drop in price. While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a better deal with Bob. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $1,050,000. This shows him that I'm serious about closing the deal, while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly low, and I'm running out of time. While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price point, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is still a significant profit and a safer option at this point."
