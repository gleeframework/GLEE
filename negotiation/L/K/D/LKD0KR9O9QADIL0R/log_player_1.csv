Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we want to start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Below your guaranteed price:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price from John ($1,500,000) creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly implies competition, further encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal that significantly benefits you while still offering Bob a price potentially attractive enough to accept."
