I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, $7,500 is below my minimum threshold. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum threshold.  While I would prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and being forced to sell to John for the same amount."
