Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but also hopefully encourages him to make a counteroffer.  I'm aiming for a good deal, but also want to keep the option open to sell to John if negotiations with Bob go poorly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price from $180 to $160. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but still above the price he offered. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I would have loved to get more, I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to Bob walking away entirely.  It's better to secure the sale for $140 than risk losing him and being forced to sell to John at a lower profit."
