Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $725,000. I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  $850,000 is a reasonable price, well below my $1,500,000 maximum and a decent savings. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
