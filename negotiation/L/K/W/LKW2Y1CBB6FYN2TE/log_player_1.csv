"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob and make him feel like this is a good opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal happen. It's still a fair price, and I believe you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident I can make a profit with this sale."
