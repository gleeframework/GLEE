"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",130.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $95? That's a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $105. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
