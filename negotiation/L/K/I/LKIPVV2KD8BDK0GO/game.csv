"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
