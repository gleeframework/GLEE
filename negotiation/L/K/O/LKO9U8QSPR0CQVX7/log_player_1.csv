"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to present this opportunity to you.  Given the value this product brings, I'm offering it at $1,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression that the product's value is even higher than Bob's perceived $800,000.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,200,000, I'm setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this offer, his counter-offers are likely to be closer to my initial price than if I started lower. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will give me valuable information about Bob's negotiation style and how eager he is to acquire the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss.  While his message sounds firm, it's still early in the negotiation. I'll counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving and gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to move from my initial price, but not to that extent. How about we consider $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession (but not too much):** I've lowered my price by $200,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also emphasizing that I'm serious about a fair price. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** This counter-offer keeps me well above my $800,000 minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  This counter-offer will reveal more about Bob's true intentions. If he's genuinely interested, he'll likely counter again. If he's not willing to budge significantly, I can consider walking away and selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can do $850,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, securing a profit.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Bob walks away. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the possibility of losing the sale to John's standing offer."
