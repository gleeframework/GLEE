Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $16,000 represents a fair price for its value, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,500. Let's try to make this work.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be closer to $12,000 for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still only able to go up to $10,000. If we can find a way to bridge the gap, I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his $10,000 offer.  While continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price from Bob, it's risky. I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John. It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed profit and move on."
