Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $800,000 (Bob's maximum) and $1,000,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin the negotiation slightly above your minimum to give yourself room to negotiate.
2. **Justification:**  While you won't reveal John's offer, you can imply you have other interested parties.
3. **Leave Room:** Don't immediately drop to your absolute lowest price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and high demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment, and I'm open to discussing the details further."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,200,000 gives you negotiating room while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Confidence and Exclusivity:** The language emphasizes the product's value and Bob's privileged position.
* **Open to Discussion:** This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you have the security of John's $1,000,000 offer. You can then decide if you want to counter Bob's rejection with a lower price or move on to John."
