"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for much cheaper than $900,000.  It's worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than the product's value to Alice. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also allowing Bob to save a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a slight reduction from her previous offer, it's still above the product's value to Alice.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. It's still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer, but closer to her potential profit margin. This might incentivize her to accept your offer, especially since she rejected your previous counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a slight decrease from the previous round, it's still too high. You've already shown your willingness to compromise by increasing your counteroffer. Continue negotiating to see if you can get a price closer to your target.  Remember, you have a safety net with John's offer if you can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some flexibility by lowering her price, but it's still above your desired range. This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway. It's a significant increase from your previous offer, but still lower than Alice's last offer.  This could encourage Alice to accept, as it's likely closer to her desired profit margin.  It's also close to your maximum acceptable price, so you're not risking a significant loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above your ideal price, it's getting closer to your maximum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it's risky. You've already had several rounds of counteroffers, and Alice might be unwilling to budge further. Additionally, you have a safety net with John's offer, which is significantly higher.  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to acquire the product at a reasonable price, saving you a significant amount of money compared to buying it from John."
