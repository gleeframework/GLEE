You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $8,500?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $7,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $8,200?

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and at this point, buying from John for $8,000 is the most financially sound decision."
