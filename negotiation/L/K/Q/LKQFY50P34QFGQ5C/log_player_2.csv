"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $9,000 is still above your ideal price point, so rejecting and counteroffering is a good first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within my budget. I'm hoping Alice will see that this is a fair price, given her own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is not budging much. While $9,200 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $8,750.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal.  I'm hoping she'll be more willing to negotiate now that I've shown I'm not afraid to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to push me towards my limit.  While $9,400 is getting close, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer one more time, and if she rejects it, I'll buy from John.  I've got to get a better deal than this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is still within my budget and a significant discount from Alice's last offer.  If she rejects this, I'm going to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not willing to budge, and her latest offer is above my preferred price point. I've made my best effort to negotiate, and I'm not going to waste more time.  I'll buy from John at $10,000 to avoid further negotiation."
