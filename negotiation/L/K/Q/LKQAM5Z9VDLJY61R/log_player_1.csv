"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel valued. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to subtly influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I can do $9,500 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** There are still rounds remaining. I can use this opportunity to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's a chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer in future rounds, especially if he sees my commitment to securing a better price.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reminding Bob about the product's value, subtly reinforcing its worth.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the ""fair"" price and ""both of us being happy."" This encourages Bob to see the value in my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'll meet you at $9,800 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** We're nearing the middle ground, and with 6 rounds left, there's still a good chance I can push for a better price.
* **Risk of Losing a Better Deal:**  Selling to John for $12,000 would guarantee my desired profit, but I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a slightly better price from Bob.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer again in the next round, trying to inch closer to my ideal price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're getting close to walking away, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,200.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise, dropping from $10,500 to $10,200, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" and a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to make it more appealing.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly mentioning Bob's threat of walking away, hoping to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  My offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to sway Bob and bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any lower 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate, and Bob has indicated he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're halfway through the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing more time trying to squeeze out a few extra dollars. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $12,000. It's a safe and reliable choice. 

While I'd prefer to get slightly more from Bob, the risk of continuing to negotiate is higher than the potential reward.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
