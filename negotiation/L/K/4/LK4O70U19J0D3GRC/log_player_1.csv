Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:**  While I could start at $149, a slightly lower initial offer makes it seem like Bob is getting a better deal and might encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The $125 offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. I can always go down a little, but I won't go below $150 as I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning ""value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, even if it's subjectively less for him."
