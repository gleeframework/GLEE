"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away.  This allows me to gauge his interest and potential negotiating range without immediately jeopardizing a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't give up my product for that price.  I need to see if Bob is willing to come up closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still maintaining a price that reflects the product's value to me. This counteroffer shows flexibility while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to see if he's serious about reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still holding firm on a value that's reasonable to me.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm now offering the minimum amount I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that Bob understands the value of the product, and I'm hopeful that he'll accept this offer. If he rejects, it's possible that I'll need to accept John's offer to avoid losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm running out of time.  With only three rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to secure a better offer from Bob. Accepting his offer of $1,300,000 ensures I get a decent profit and avoid selling to John for a lower price."
