Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your interest in selling this product, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've placed on it.  Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which represents a significant investment for me.  This offer is closer to my maximum limit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your needs and my ability to pay. Let's work together to find a solution.

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's clear that the gap between his valuation and mine is too large to bridge through further negotiation. Accepting his current offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
