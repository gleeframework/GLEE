"Alice, while I appreciate your interest in selling this product, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've placed on it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which represents a significant investment for me.  This offer is closer to my maximum limit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your needs and my ability to pay. Let's work together to find a solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
