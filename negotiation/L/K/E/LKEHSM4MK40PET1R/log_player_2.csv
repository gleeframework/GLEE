"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth more to me than $80, so this is a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay $100 for the product, and John is offering it at that price. Alice's offer is the same price, but you don't know her minimum price.  It's possible to get a better deal by rejecting Alice and buying from John."
