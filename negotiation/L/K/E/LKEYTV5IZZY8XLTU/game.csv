"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested!",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the product's value to me,  $925,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to the value you're looking for.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested!",900000.0,Alice,5,
