"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $5000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, $7000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $12000.
