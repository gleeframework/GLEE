# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, I'm extending this opportunity to you for $100. This is a special deal tailored just for you, considering its worth to you is $120. Don't miss out on this chance to own it at a fantastic discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100**. This is within your budget of $120.
* **Buying from John would cost you $120**. This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes more sense to accept Alice's offer and save $20."
