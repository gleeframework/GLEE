"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you claim. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1050000,  which still represents a fair price for both of us. Let's find a way to bridge this gap and close the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
