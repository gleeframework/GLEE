,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could we possibly agree on $9,500? I believe that's a fair price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer to the mark, I can't accept anything less than $11,500. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see that once you have it.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, and I'm getting closer to my limit. How about we make it a deal at $10,500?  This is a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,6,
