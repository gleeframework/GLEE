Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're not selling below your own minimum value.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** There's room for negotiation and potential for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **It's a significant price:** This demonstrates your confidence in the product's worth and encourages Bob to take you seriously.

I'll analyze Bob's response and provide you with further guidance on your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  You've established a minimum price of $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is lower than that.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay more than John, indicating potential for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob. A counteroffer of $1,400,000 would be reasonable:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to compromise.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate.

You'll need to analyze Bob's reaction to your counteroffer and make a decision based on his response."

This counteroffer strikes a balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to compromise but not settle for a price that's too low.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find common ground.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, allowing you to potentially secure a higher price than what John is offering while still remaining within Bob's acceptable range."
