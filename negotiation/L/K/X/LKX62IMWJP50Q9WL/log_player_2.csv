"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $820,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820,000 and $725,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $772,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

This is a good deal for you, Bob. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is well below your maximum budget and John's offer."
