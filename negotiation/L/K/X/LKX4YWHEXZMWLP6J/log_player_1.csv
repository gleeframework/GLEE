"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to compromise and reach a deal.  I'll be watching how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still worth trying to push for a bit more. Bob clearly values the product at $15,000, so there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  That way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $13,250. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $13,250 is getting very close. It's also likely that his counteroffers will continue to decrease in future rounds.  At this point, it's safer to accept his offer and secure the deal.  It's important to balance the desire for more profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
