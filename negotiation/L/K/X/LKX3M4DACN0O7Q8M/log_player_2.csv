"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for it. This is a special offer tailored to recognize the importance of this product to you and to ensure we achieve a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but not by enough.** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.  This means you could save $500 by accepting.
* **However, you're trying to save as much money as possible.**  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller who might be willing to offer a better deal."
