"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay for the product ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $500,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to come back with a price closer to what Bob is willing to pay, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it is closer to his initial counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a price closer to his desired $500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing that he is willing to move a little closer to Alice's price, but still wants to secure a better deal. A $600,000 counteroffer is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, indicating that he is serious about purchasing the product but still wants to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer would result in a significant saving compared to buying from John. There's still a small chance Alice could lower her price further, but the risk of her rejecting the offer and losing the deal altogether is greater.  It's time to secure the product at a good price."
