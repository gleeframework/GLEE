"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but $160 is still a bit steep. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $145?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $145 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $152.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $152.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $149.99, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll buy the product from you.",149.99,Bob,6,
