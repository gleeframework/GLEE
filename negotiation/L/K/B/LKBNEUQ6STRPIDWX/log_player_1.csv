Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum value, I'm not eager to sell at that price. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but I'm still prepared to negotiate if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum value, and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round.  I'm going to accept his offer."
