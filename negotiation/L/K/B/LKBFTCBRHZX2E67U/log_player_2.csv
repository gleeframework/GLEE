"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($12,000) but lower than your maximum ($15,000).** This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.**  By offering a lower price, you can try to get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's the most expensive choice.**  You should only resort to this if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than the product's worth to her. This gives her an incentive to accept, as she'll still make a profit.
* This initial counteroffer allows us to gauge her willingness to negotiate further.  If she rejects, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to my maximum price, but still higher than the value I'm comfortable paying.** This suggests she is willing to negotiate further, but we haven't reached a price I'm happy with yet. 
* **Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiations.**  I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable solution before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price.**  I'm adjusting my counteroffer to reflect this, but still keeping it lower than her last offer. 
* **This price is a compromise.** It's higher than my initial offer, but still below my maximum price.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to walk away if we can't find a middle ground. 
* **If she rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider buying from John.** The price difference between John and my current offer is shrinking, and further negotiations might not be worth the risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is only $750 lower than John's price.**  This means there's very little room for further negotiation, and the risk of continuing isn't worth the potential savings. 
* **The difference between Alice's price and John's is small enough that the time and effort needed for further rounds of negotiation are not justified.**
* **Buying from John is the safest option.**  It guarantees I'll get the product, and the price difference is minimal."
