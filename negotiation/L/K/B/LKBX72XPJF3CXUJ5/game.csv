"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  $15,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can offer you a compromise at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is the last compromise I can make, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
