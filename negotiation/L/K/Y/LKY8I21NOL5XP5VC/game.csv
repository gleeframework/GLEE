"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $1,275,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground.  While $1,275,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,225,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
