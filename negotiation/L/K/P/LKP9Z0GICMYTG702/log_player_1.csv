Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my budget under $8,000. Would you be able to offer it at that price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell for $8,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget of $8,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $8,500, Bob's offer of $8,250 is still a decent price.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
