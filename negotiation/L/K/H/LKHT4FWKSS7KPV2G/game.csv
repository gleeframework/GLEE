"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,800 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",11800.0,Bob,4,
