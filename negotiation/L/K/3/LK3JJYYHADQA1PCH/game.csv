"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the product's value, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While that's closer, I need to be mindful of my budget. I could do $950,000. That's a strong offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here.  I'm willing to make one final push to close this deal. I can go down to $1,150,000.  This is the best I can do, and I think it's a very fair offer considering the product's potential.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
