Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here.  I'm willing to make one final push to close this deal. I can go down to $1,150,000.  This is the best I can do, and I think it's a very fair offer considering the product's potential.

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that makes sense for me before I'd lose more in potential savings. John's offer is a clean $1,000,000 and guarantees I stay within my budget."
