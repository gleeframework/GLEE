"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a better price than $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $60. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $65 is a good deal, especially considering the $120 price from John. Accepting this offer saves $55, which is a significant amount of money. It's better to accept the offer and move on."
