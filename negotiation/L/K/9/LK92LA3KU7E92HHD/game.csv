"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you meet me halfway?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
