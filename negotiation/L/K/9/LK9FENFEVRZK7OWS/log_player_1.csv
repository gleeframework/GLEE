Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product! I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $140 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low. I need to make sure I'm getting a decent price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $160? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $150 is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, and it's a fair price for both of us.  It's better than selling to John for the same price and avoids further negotiation."
