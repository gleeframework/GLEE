"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",150.0,Bob,4,
