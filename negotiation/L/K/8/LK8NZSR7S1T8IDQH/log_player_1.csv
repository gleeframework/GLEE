"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $1,000,000?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,200,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
