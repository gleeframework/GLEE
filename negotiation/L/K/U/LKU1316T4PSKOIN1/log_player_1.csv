"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  This price allows for a counteroffer from Bob without immediately making me feel like I need to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and not feel pressured. 

**Note:** This is just a starting point. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds.  I'm always keeping in mind the $15,000 offer from John, which sets my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my target price.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. 
* **John's Offer:** Remember, John is willing to pay $15,000. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm not giving away the farm. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, which shows a willingness to find common ground.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** This price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my initial offer, leaving space for further negotiation if needed. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping in mind the $15,000 offer from John and won't accept anything below $10,000 (at least for now). I'm still aiming for a higher price but willing to make concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not willing to settle for anything lower than that at this point.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and I think I can push him a little higher.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to reject this offer and continue the negotiations.
* **John's offer is still a backup:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, which gives me confidence to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,800 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,200.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount this time, showing flexibility while still maintaining a position above my minimum price. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to see the value in the product. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm not giving in completely, as my offer is still above Bob's last offer.  This keeps the pressure on him to come closer to my price.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  If Bob accepts, I will have secured a profitable sale. If he rejects, I have room for further negotiation and am still comfortably above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200, which is $10,000. That's the best I can do. Is that acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum acceptable price, which I set based on my own valuation and John's offer.
* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 6, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Accepting this offer means I can potentially build a relationship with Bob for future deals. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'm aware that I could always go to John if I needed to.

While I might have preferred a higher price, I believe this is a good outcome considering the limited time and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
