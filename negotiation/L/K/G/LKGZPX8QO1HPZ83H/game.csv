"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $16,000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about $14,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now.",14000.0,Bob,4,
