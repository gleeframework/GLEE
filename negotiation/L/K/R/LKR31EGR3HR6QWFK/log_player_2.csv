"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000, you know you can potentially get a better deal. Alice is clearly trying to negotiate up from the product's value to her ($8,000). There's room to negotiate further down from her offer."
