Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to your desired amount. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning that you'll list it publicly implies other interested buyers, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning the ""value and demand"" aims to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject this offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first."
