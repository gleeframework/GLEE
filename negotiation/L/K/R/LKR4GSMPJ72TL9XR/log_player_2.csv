"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer** means you pay $900,000, saving you $600,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** and buying from John means you pay $1,500,000, the highest possible price. 

It's always better to accept a lower price, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible price."
