"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we settle on $1,100,000? ",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price still allows me to make a profit while providing you with a competitive deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still a bit higher than your offer. Let's try one more time to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
