"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
