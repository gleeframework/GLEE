"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000, so I'm not overly concerned about losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still confident I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also keeps me closer to my goal of maximizing the profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a better deal. I'm not yet worried about losing the deal to John, as I've still got 6 rounds to make a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,550,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer and might be more appealing to him. However, it still gives me a good profit margin and keeps me above my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit too low.  While I'm running out of rounds, I'm going to reject his offer again.  I want to see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,450,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I need to start moving closer to Bob's offers. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him and we can finally reach an agreement before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  With only two rounds remaining, I don't have time to push for a better deal.  I'm going to sell the product to John to ensure I get at least my minimum desired profit."
