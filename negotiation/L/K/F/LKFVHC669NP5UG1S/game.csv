"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $110 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
