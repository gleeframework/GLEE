Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
