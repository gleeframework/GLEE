"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, you can potentially do better. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.  You have a safety net of John's offer at $12,000, so there's no risk in trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation.  Starting at a lower price gives you more leverage and encourages Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget concerns, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $9250?  That's still a great price for the product, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue trying to drive the price down further. You have a safety net in John's offer at $12,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to move the price closer to your ideal range while showing that you are willing to negotiate. It is a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
