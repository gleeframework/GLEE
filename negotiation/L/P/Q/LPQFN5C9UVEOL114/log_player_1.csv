"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This price is significantly higher than my minimum, and it's a good starting point for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $150.  Let's see if he's willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to accept just yet. Bob's offer is still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $110.  This is a compromise - closer to his offer, but still above my minimum and closer to my initial offer.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's time to close the deal."
