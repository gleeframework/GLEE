"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12000, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible and might be able to get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $9250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and Bob has already made multiple counteroffers. Accepting the offer at $9,250 still saves Bob $2,750 compared to buying from John. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price, and he risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting Alice's final offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
