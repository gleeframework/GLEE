"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go up to $110. How about $107.50? That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",107.5,Bob,6,
