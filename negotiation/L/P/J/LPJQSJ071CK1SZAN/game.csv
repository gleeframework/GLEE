"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm confident you'll find immense value in it.  I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $13,250 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given this some thought, and while I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'll try to meet you at $12,800. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",12800.0,Bob,6,
