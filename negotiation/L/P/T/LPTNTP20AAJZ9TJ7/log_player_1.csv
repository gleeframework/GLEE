Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum acceptable price is $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still holding firm above Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also preserving a healthy margin."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and we've gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  I'm confident that I can secure the full $15,000 by selling to John, so that's the best choice for me."
