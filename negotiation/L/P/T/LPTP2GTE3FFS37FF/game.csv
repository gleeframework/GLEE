"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $107.50. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $106.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $106 yet. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $108. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you is $120. Let me know if this works for you.",108.0,Alice,5,
