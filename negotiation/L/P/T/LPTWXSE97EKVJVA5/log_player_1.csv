"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is a decent markup from my minimum. I'm aiming to strike a balance between being aggressive and leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by being friendly and confident."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm interested in purchasing it for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell just yet.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However,  $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. Would $10,000 be acceptable for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his price, and I've already made a significant concession.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection is high.  It's time to cut my losses and move on. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and it's the most sensible option at this point."
