"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $100.  It's getting closer, but unfortunately, that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $120. This is a really good deal for you, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's make this happen!",120.0,Alice,5,
