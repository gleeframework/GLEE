{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above Bob's value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm confident that I can still get a price closer to my minimum value of $150. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not desperate and can afford to walk away from the deal if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. 
* **Opportunity to Improve:** I can still negotiate with Bob, potentially getting a better price than $90.
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $150, which guarantees me a profit. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but making a counter-proposal that is closer to my minimum value. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at $110.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $100 is closer to my minimum value of $150, it's still not enough to make the sale worthwhile.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I can still negotiate with Bob, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a safe alternative:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have the option to sell to John for $150, which guarantees a profit.

I will make another counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $100.  It's getting closer, but unfortunately, that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $120. This is a really good deal for you, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Final Offer Stance:** I'm positioning this as my final offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at $120.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** I'm using an enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable price while still allowing me to earn a good amount of money."
