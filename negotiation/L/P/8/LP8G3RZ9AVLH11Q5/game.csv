"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing a fair price. I propose we start with a price of $12,000. This allows us some room to negotiate while ensuring I receive a fair return for my investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $10,000. This offers a compromise between our positions and maintains a reasonable profit margin for me. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good value for the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I am willing to consider $9,500 as a compromise price for the product. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being fair to you. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",9500.0,Alice,5,
