"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I'm looking for a figure closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $1,212,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
