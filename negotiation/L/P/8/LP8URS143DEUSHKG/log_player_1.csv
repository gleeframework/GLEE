Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I'm looking for a figure closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $1,175,000? It's a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested and his offers are steadily increasing. We're getting close to my minimum, but I think there's still room to push for a slightly better deal.  We'll aim for a price closer to $1.2 million in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $1,212,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to budge a little more.  How about $1,190,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his current offer of $1,190,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a significant risk he won't reach my $1,200,000 minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a safe and acceptable outcome at this point. It's better to take the guaranteed offer than risk ending up with less from Bob."
