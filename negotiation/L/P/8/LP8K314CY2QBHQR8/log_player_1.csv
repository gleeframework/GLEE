Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because John acts as a safety net.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aim high while still staying within a reasonable range for Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** You're not beating around the bush, showing you value your product.
* **Highlighting Value:** ""Unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob why he's interested.
* **Strong Opening Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go. 
* **Consider Bob's Perspective:**  A price that seems too high might make Bob walk away, even if it's within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship Matters:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important for future deals, you might adjust your approach."
