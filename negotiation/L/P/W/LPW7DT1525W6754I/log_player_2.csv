Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for you.  This is a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, this is a valuable product and I'm keen to make a deal, but I need to be firm on my price. My final offer is $10,500. This is a significant concession and reflects my best possible offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my target price, it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000. I can get the product for $10,000 from John, guaranteeing I don't overpay.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
