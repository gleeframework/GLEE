Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$140** is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob. 
* This offer allows me to maximize profit while also potentially securing a sale. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum desired price of $150**.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for $130 at this point. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.** I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. 
* **Selling to John is an option, but it's not ideal as it limits my profit potential.**  Negotiating with Bob might lead to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $135. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$135 is a compromise.** It's halfway between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130. 
* **The message remains friendly and open to further negotiation.** It acknowledges Bob's offer while reaffirming my desire for a higher price.
* **This counteroffer increases the chance of a successful sale.**  It's closer to Bob's perceived value while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $150**. I'm not willing to sell for less, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is offering my minimum.
* **While I'm open to negotiation, I'm running the risk of prolonging the process with Bob and potentially losing time.** 
* **Selling to John provides a quick and certain profit at my desired price.**  It's the most logical and efficient option at this point."
