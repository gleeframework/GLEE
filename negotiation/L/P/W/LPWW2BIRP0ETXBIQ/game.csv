"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $105. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, and I'm willing to pay $95.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to counteroffer at $102. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",102.0,Alice,5,
