"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're excited about the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
