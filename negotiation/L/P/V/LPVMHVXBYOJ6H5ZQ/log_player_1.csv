Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""unique value"") to justify the high initial price.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The open-ended question (""What are your thoughts?"") encourages Bob to engage in negotiation and reveals how interested he is in the product. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then propose a lower price, gradually moving closer to his perceived value of $8,000. However, Alice should never go below her own minimum of $12,000 as she has a guaranteed buyer at that price."
