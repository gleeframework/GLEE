Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum.  Any deal needs to bridge this gap through negotiation tactics.

**Strategy**

While a mutually agreeable deal seems impossible at first glance, you have leverage: the guaranteed sale to John. This lets you aim high with Bob, knowing you have a backup plan.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,450,000 price is a strong anchor, starting the negotiation well above Bob's valuation. While he's unlikely to accept it outright, it sets a high bar.
* **Exclusivity and Scarcity:**  By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and value. 
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're framing it as connected to the ""unique value and potential.""

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Unlikely, but the best-case scenario. You get significantly more than John's offer.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Most likely. He'll counter with a lower offer, and you can then negotiate towards a price you find acceptable, knowing you have John's offer as a safety net.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed with selling the product to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Be confident:**  Your tone should convey the value of the product.
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  If Bob doesn't meet a price that works for you, you have a strong alternative."
