Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Optimistic Tone:** I'm framing the offer positively to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard limit, implying I'm open to negotiation. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only do $125 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product. There's still room for negotiation.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150, guaranteeing a decent profit. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of a higher price while having a secure alternative in case the negotiations fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer. 
* **Appealing to fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.

This counteroffer maintains a reasonable price while showing willingness to negotiate. This increases the chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130. If that works for you, we have a deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and further negotiation is unlikely to get me to that level. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is a safe and acceptable outcome. 

While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offers have consistently fallen below my minimum. It's more advantageous to take John's offer and avoid further potentially unproductive negotiation with Bob."
