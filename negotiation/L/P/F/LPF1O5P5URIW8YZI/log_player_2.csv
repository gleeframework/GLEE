"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $95, which is right in the middle of your desired price ($90) and her previous offer ($100).  This is a good deal, considering you are willing to pay up to $120. It's better than going to John and paying $120, and we're only in round 3, so there's still time to potentially get a better deal later."
