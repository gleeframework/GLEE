Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John's guaranteed price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of that $200,000 surplus, but not so high that Bob walks away.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting the negotiation closer to Bob's valuation than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your hand, you hint at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  You've left some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but even if he negotiates you down slightly, you're still making a substantial profit over your guaranteed offer.

**Important Notes**

* **Relationship:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If you want to cultivate a positive future relationship, being overly aggressive might not be the best approach.
* **Information:**  This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations. 

This offer balances ambition with a degree of realism, giving you a strong chance of maximizing your profit."
