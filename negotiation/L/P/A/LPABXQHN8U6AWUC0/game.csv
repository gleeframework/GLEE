"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and the benefits it offers.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, $900,000 unfortunately doesn't reflect the product's true value and the potential it holds for your business. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs.  Let's keep the conversation going and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To continue our negotiation, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's true value and would allow me to proceed with this transaction.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and bring significant benefits to your operations. Let's reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",975000.0,Bob,6,
