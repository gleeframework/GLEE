Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you like the offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $92. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $92 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of the price going up or missing out entirely."
