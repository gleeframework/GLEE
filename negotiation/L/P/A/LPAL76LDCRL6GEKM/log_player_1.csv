Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That's a bit steep for me, though.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand it's a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. How about $95? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $95 is still a bit much for me. I could meet you at $80, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $80.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk Bob walking away in the remaining rounds."
