Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a good deal (saving $10) and earns you the highest possible profit ($40) compared to selling to John. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob, knowing you have a backup buyer."
