Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 risks Bob rejecting it outright.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This offer stands for 48 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. A 48-hour limit creates a sense of urgency.
* **Price:**  $1,350,000 splits the difference between Bob's perceived value and your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to create more bargaining space.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a more generous offer might be preferable.

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
