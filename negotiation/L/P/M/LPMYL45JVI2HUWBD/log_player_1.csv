Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** There's room for negotiation, and Bob has incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can still increase the price. 

**Key considerations:**

* **John's offer:** Remember John's $8,000 offer is your safety net.  Don't let your negotiations with Bob fall below that.
* **Bob's potential counteroffers:** Be prepared for Bob to offer a lower price. You can then decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of your own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10000 for your product.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  While it's tempting to accept, selling for $10,000 is still below your desired profit margin and your minimum of $8,000.
* **There's room for a counteroffer:**  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **John's offer is your safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob break down, you can always sell to John for $8,000.

**Next steps:**  You will need to send a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000 to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial price. How about $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me the profit I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $11,000 is still higher than your $8,000 minimum.
* **Potential for acceptance:** This price might be appealing to Bob as it's a reasonable compromise, and he knows you're willing to negotiate.

**Key point:** You're staying firm on your desired profit margin, while also showing flexibility to reach a deal."
