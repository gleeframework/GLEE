"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save more.  By rejecting the offer, you can explore if Alice is willing to go lower.  It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a lower price outweighs the risk of buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice will reject it, but it sets the stage for a more aggressive bargaining position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my initial counteroffer, which means she's willing to negotiate. There's still room for me to push for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue bargaining and potentially get a better deal than $820,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from $700,000 to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $810,000, which is only $60,000 more than my last counteroffer.  This is a significant price reduction from her initial offer and is much closer to my target price. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 is too high. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
