Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a higher offer of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he accepts immediately, I've secured a significant profit.  
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always negotiate down, knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000."
