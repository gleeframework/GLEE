"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, but lower than John's offer. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.  I'm hoping to tempt Bob into accepting, but if he doesn't, I have room to lower the price a bit in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and while $12,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth selling for that price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise, as it's halfway between what I'm willing to take and what Bob has offered.  I hope this encourages Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price. It's still below what I ideally want, but it's a good compromise considering I'm only on round 4. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
