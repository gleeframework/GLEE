"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. How about $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
