"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $13,000 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $13,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm ready to make a serious offer of $10,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful that we can close a deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make at least $12,000 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12500.0,Alice,5,
