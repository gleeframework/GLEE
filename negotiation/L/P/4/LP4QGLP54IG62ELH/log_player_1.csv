Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is only worth $100 to Bob, offering it slightly above his perceived value might pique his interest. There might be aspects he hasn't considered, or he might be willing to pay a premium for convenience. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  Offering it at $175 still leaves room to make a profit above what John is offering ($150). 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price slightly downward if needed, but remember your bottom line is $150."
