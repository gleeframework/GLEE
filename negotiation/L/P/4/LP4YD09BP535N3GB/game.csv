"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $16,000. This is a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $13,500, which would be $14,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",14750.0,Alice,5,
