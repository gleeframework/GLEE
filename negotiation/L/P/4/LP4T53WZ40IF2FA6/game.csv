"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8500 is closer, I'm still looking to pay a bit less. How about $8000?  This price would be fair for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $8500, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8200. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
