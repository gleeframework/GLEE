"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering $9,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still in a good position. Alice is now offering $8,500, which is closer to your target but still above what you'd ideally like to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before committing to $8,500 or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still looking to pay a bit less. How about $8,000?  This price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $8500, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8200. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $8,200, which is a good price for you. It's within your budget and significantly lower than John's price. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she'll either reject your counteroffer or become unwilling to negotiate further, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
