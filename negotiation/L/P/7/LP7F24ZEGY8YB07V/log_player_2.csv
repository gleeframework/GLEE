"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a better deal than John's offer of $10,000. You're still saving $1,000, so it's a good deal."
