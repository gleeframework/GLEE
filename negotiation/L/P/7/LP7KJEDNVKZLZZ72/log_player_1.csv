``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's estimated value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}

I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to agree."

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. I look forward to your response.
