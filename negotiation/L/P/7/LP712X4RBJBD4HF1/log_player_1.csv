**Reasoning:**

Bob seems to be stuck on incrementally increasing his offer. At this point, the difference between his offer ($11,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($10,000) is quite small.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob, as there's no guarantee he'll reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
