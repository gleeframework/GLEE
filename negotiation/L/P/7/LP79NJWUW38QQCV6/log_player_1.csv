"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will be acceptable to Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is getting closer to my ideal price, and we're already on round 4.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn, so I'll accept his offer."
