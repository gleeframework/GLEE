"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price is fair and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price.  However, $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
