"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000. How about $12,500? That's the best I can do.",12500.0,Bob,4,
