"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $12,000 is a significant amount higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This ensures a good profit for me.
* **Message:**  I'm friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Strategy:** I aim to get a high initial offer to establish a strong starting point for the negotiation. This also gives Bob a chance to think about the value of the product to him and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still a good profit for me, it's below my initial goal.  I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a price lower than $12,000. I'm confident I can either secure a better price from Bob or sell to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not by too much. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Message:**  I'm staying polite but firm, emphasizing the fairness and value of the counteroffer. I'm also aiming to get Bob to think about the deal's benefits for him. 
* **Strategy:** My goal is to gradually narrow the gap while keeping the price above my minimum acceptable offer. This increases the chances of closing a deal without selling to John."
