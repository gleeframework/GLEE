"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,800,000 to you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,600,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,000,000 is a little too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a budget under $1,100,000. Would you be open to a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of the product.  Let's settle at $1,175,000. This demonstrates significant movement on my side while recognizing the asset's worth.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
