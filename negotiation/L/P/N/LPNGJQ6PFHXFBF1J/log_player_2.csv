# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $90, while John is selling for $100.
* **The product is worth more to you than Alice's price:**  The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90, meaning you'll still save $10.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to maximize your savings."
