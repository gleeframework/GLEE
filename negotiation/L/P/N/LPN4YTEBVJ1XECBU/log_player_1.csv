"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price, framing it as an investment opportunity.
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to remember that I have John as a backup buyer. This knowledge empowers me to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget. How about we start closer to my range and go from there?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Bob's message indicates a willingness to negotiate (""start closer to my range and go from there""). Rejecting this lowball offer signals that I'm serious about the value of the product and encourages him to make a more realistic proposal in the next round.
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 provides a safety net. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your budget constraints but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the unique benefits the product offers and leaves room for a profitable partnership."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, I'm showing flexibility by significantly decreasing my initial price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:**  The new price of $1,900,000 is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This maintains a strong position and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message uses positive language (""find a middle ground,"" ""profitable partnership"") to encourage Bob to continue negotiating towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big leap from my initial offer. To be frank, I'm working with a maximum budget of $800,000. If you're able to get closer to that number, I'm very interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealed Information:** Bob has revealed his maximum budget of $800,000.  While this is still below my minimum, it's crucial information.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Bob's offer of $650,000 is a small increase.  I need to see if he's willing to move significantly closer to his $800,000 limit.
* **John as Leverage:** My ability to sell to John for $1,500,000 means I can afford to play hardball. Bob needs to make a compelling jump to stay in the game."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I want to find a way for us to work together.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my absolute floor, reflecting the significant value this product holds. Let me know if we can make this work."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring at the Minimum:** I'm dropping my price significantly to my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. This clearly signals to Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal but not willing to go any lower.
* **Direct and Firm:** The message is clear that this is my final offer (""absolute floor""). This puts the ball in Bob's court and forces a decision.
* **Limited Time:**  By round 5, we are past the halfway point.  This sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act. 
* **John in the Wings:**  I haven't completely closed the door on selling to John.  If Bob doesn't meet my price, I'm prepared to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming closer. That said, $1,500,000 is still a significant stretch from what I can realistically do. If you're truly committed to making this work, I can offer you $700,000. This is a firm offer, as I need to stay within my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has indicated that $700,000 is his best offer. Even though he increased his offer slightly, it's still significantly below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Unlikely to Budge:**  Bob has stated this is a ""firm offer"" due to his budget. Further negotiation is unlikely to close the substantial gap.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000. Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without further risk or wasted time. 

Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point has a low probability of success and risks losing a guaranteed, acceptable offer from John."
