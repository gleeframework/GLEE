"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget. How about we start closer to my range and go from there? ",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your budget constraints but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the unique benefits the product offers and leaves room for a profitable partnership.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big leap from my initial offer. To be frank, I'm working with a maximum budget of $800,000. If you're able to get closer to that number, I'm very interested in making a deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I want to find a way for us to work together.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my absolute floor, reflecting the significant value this product holds. Let me know if we can make this work.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming closer. That said, $1,500,000 is still a significant stretch from what I can realistically do. If you're truly committed to making this work, I can offer you $700,000. This is a firm offer, as I need to stay within my budget. ",700000.0,Bob,6,
