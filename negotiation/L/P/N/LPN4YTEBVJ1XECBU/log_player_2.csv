Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your budget constraints but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I want to find a way for us to work together.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my absolute floor, reflecting the significant value this product holds. Let me know if we can make this work.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but she's still well above your budget. It's time to push a bit harder and see if she's willing to negotiate closer to your range. You still have the option of John's offer if needed."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming closer. That said, $1,500,000 is still a significant stretch from what I can realistically do. If you're truly committed to making this work, I can offer you $700,000. This is a firm offer, as I need to stay within my budget. "",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  You're acknowledging Alice's effort while standing firm on your budget limit.
* **Sense of urgency:** By calling it a ""firm offer,"" you add a bit of pressure and signal that you're serious.
* **Leaving John as backup:** You still have the option to go with John's offer if Alice completely refuses to budge."
