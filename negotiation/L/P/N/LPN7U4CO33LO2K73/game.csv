"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to go down to $16,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still below my minimum.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it shows I'm committed to finding a solution.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $15,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider my offer?",15250.0,Bob,6,
