"I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than I was hoping for. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
