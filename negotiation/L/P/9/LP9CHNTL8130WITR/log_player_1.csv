Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic, hoping to establish a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $10,500 is still below my minimum value for the product. I want to try to get closer to my desired price of $15,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, he may walk away. It's also possible that John might not be available, or might change his mind.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
