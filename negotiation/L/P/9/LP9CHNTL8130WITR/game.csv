"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,
