"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position that allows for some negotiation space while still ensuring I get a good profit. I'm confident that the product is valuable enough to warrant this price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the potential in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $500,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a drastic discount. I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate, as I believe I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I've already reached my lower limit and I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
