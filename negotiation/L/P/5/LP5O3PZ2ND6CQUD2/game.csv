"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $750,000?  That's still a great value for you, and it gives us a good starting point for a deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $700,000 is a fair offer, but I need to see a bit more to make this work for me. How about we split the difference at $725,000? It's a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement.  How about $710,000?  That's a strong offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $710,000 is getting closer to what I need, but I'm still a bit away. How about we meet halfway at $715,000? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $712,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this.",712000.0,Bob,8,
