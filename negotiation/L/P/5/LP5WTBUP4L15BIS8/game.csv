,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is closer to my budget and still a good price for you.  Let's make this deal happen!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet at $105? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm really keen on getting this product though, so how about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $107? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",107.0,Alice,7,
