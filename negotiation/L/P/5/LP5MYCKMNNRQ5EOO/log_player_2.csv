"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This represents a substantial savings for you, and a great opportunity for us to establish a mutually beneficial relationship.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000,000.**  This is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Buying from John would cost you $1,200,000.**
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $200,000.**

Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, you can still save a substantial amount by taking her offer."
