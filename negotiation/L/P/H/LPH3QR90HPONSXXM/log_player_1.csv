**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at a price significantly below my minimum. His ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. Accepting his offer would mean a loss of $120,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential reward. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed sale with John."
