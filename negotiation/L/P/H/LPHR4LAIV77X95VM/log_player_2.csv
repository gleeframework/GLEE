"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John. There's no reason to accept this initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $18,000 is higher than I'm able to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement from the previous round, it's still higher than Bob's budget. He can still get the product for $12,000 from John, making Alice's offer unnecessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000. It's my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's limit. It's clear that Alice isn't willing to go lower than $14,500, and Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for a lower price.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice at this point."
