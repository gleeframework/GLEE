Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting high allows room for negotiation. While $20,000 is more than Bob wants to pay, it's important to see how he responds before going lower.  This leaves space to negotiate down towards his value while still aiming to get closer to my own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is better than nothing, but it's still significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my target. Selling to John right now would meet my minimum but I believe I can potentially get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise.  It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Closer to My Value:** $16,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000 and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how serious Bob is about the product and how much he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Could you consider $14,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob has now offered $14,000, which is only $1,000 less than my guaranteed sale to John.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I risk losing the sale entirely if I push further. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, securing a profit while avoiding the risk of continued negotiation."
