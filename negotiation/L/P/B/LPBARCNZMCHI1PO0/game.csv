"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this product has the potential to bring significant value to your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer. I'm willing to offer $800000. This represents a significant step towards finding a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $850000, which would be $825000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,5,
