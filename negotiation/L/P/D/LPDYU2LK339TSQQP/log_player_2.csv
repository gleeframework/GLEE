"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price of $75. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You have a clear upper limit of $120 and 9 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $60 for this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** $60 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer, but still within the realm of possibility.  This shows you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Opening the dialogue:**  The message focuses on negotiation rather than simply rejecting the offer. It invites Alice to counter and potentially reach a middle ground.
* **Setting the stage for future rounds:**  If Alice rejects $60, you have room to move up slightly in subsequent rounds while still staying below your $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we offer the product at $65? This still gives you a good discount compared to the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** $65 is a reasonable middle ground between your counteroffer of $60 and Alice's previous offer of $75. 
* **Time is a factor:** You've already had two rounds of negotiation, and accepting this offer keeps you on track to secure the product within your budget.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While $65 isn't the absolute lowest you could potentially get, accepting this offer doesn't close the door on potential future deals with Alice (if you decide to buy more from her in the future)."
