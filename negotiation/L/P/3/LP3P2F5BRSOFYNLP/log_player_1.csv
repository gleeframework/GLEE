Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob has a strong incentive to buy.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering Bob $13,000. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, and it seems like he's not willing to go higher.  Selling to John at $15,000 is the best option for me at this point."
