"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $999000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
