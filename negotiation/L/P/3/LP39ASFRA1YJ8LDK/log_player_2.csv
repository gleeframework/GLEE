Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $975,000, which is a good deal considering John's offer is $1,000,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to save $25,000."
