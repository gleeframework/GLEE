"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate the opportunity. However,  $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $120?  I'm very interested in the product, but that's my maximum budget.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that 120 is your maximum budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 135. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,3,
