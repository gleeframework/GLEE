"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is around $1,500,000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's a price I can realistically accept.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
