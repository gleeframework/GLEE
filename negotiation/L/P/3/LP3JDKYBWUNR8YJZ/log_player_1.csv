"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit.  Since Bob values the product at $80, this price is likely to be rejected, but it gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $80. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is still too low. I want to get closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, as it's still well above his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, $100 is close to my minimum and it's likely Bob won't budge much further.  I don't want to risk him walking away completely, especially since I have the option to sell to John."
