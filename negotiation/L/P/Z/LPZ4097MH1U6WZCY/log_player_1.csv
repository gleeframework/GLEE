Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special discounted price of $14,000. I think it would be a valuable addition to what you're doing, and this offer is a great opportunity to get it."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, selling to Bob for a slightly lower price could still be more profitable than waiting.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $14,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still represents a ""deal"" compared to our fallback option. 
* **Urgency and Value:** The message hints at the product's value to Bob and subtly creates a sense of urgency to encourage a quick decision. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
