"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is tempting, I know the product is worth $150 to me (and I have another buyer lined up at that price). There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get Bob closer to my minimum, and I risk him walking away. It's a better business decision to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
