"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to a deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000, which would be $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
