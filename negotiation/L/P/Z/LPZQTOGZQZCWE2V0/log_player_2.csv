"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. You can then try to negotiate with Alice further or go with John's offer as a fallback."
