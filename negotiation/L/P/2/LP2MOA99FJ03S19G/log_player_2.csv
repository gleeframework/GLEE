"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your ideal price but still within your budget.**  You're looking to save as much as possible, so accepting right away isn't the best strategy.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always secure the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Within Your Budget:** $10,000 is still within your budget, but it leaves you room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Negotiation Tone:** The message is polite but firm, indicating you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Ideal Price:**  $11,500 is closer to your desired price point than Alice's initial offer and still within your budget.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** You already made a significant counteroffer, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal. 
* **Avoid Risk:**  While you could try to bargain further, accepting Alice's offer is a safer option than risking a stalemate and having to buy from John at a higher price."
