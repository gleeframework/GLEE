"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$12,000 is still too high for Bob. He can do better. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a good deal.  He's starting with a lower counteroffer, hoping to get closer to Alice's minimum. This leaves room for negotiation, but also signals that he's serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit high for Bob. He's aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  There are still rounds left, so he's willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. $10,000 is a significant step closer to Alice's perceived value of the product, making it more likely she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $13,500 is closer to Bob's maximum, he's still aiming for a lower price.  With 5 rounds left, there's still room to negotiate further.  He's likely hoping Alice will come down further or that his next counteroffer will be accepted."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but staying below Alice's last price point. This signals that he's willing to meet halfway, but still pushing for a better price.  With fewer rounds left, Bob needs to find a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding John's higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, the negotiating window is closing.  Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting very close to Bob's maximum.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly better price.  Rather than risk further rounds of rejection, Bob chooses to purchase from John at $15,000 to ensure he gets the product.  While it's not his ideal price, it guarantees the purchase and avoids the potential for a breakdown in negotiations."
