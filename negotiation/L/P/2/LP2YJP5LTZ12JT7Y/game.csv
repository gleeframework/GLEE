"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the asking price is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the product's potential.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're making a significant investment, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
