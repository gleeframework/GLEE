"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the asking price is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Not Too Low:**  While starting low, it's important to avoid an offer so low that it's insulting or unrealistic.  Offering $800,000 demonstrates a serious interest while still aiming for significant savings. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** Remember, your absolute limit is $1,000,000 because of John's offer.  By starting at $800,000, we have room to increase our offer in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice lowered her price, $1,750,000 is still significantly more than our ideal price and what John offers.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate, even if slightly, suggests there might be room for further price reductions. 
* **John as Leverage:** We still have John's offer as a backup, giving us leverage to walk away if Alice doesn't move closer to our desired range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting John's Price:** We are now matching John's offer of $1,000,000. This sets a clear limit for Alice and signals the seriousness of our interest while not exceeding our budget.
* **Justification:** Highlighting that this is our maximum and a significant investment emphasizes the value we place on the product without revealing our walk-away alternative (John).
* **Pressure on Alice:** By holding firm at our limit, we put pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to lose the sale to make a smaller profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're making a significant investment, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $1,600,000 is her final offer. This significantly limits our negotiation space.
* **Over Budget:** Even with her final offer, the price is still $600,000 over our budget and what John is offering.
* **No More Leverage:**  Alice is unlikely to move much, if at all, from her final offer. We've already signaled our maximum with our previous offer. 

**Conclusion:**  While the product might have potential value, it's not worth exceeding our budget when a guaranteed alternative exists. It's time to walk away from negotiations with Alice and buy from John for $1,000,000."
