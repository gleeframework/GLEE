"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I do like the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I want to start significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** My message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states my position that the initial price is too high. 
* **Strategic Number:** $1,050,000 is a round number that suggests a serious counteroffer while leaving room to negotiate upwards if needed. 

I'm aiming to get the product for a price closer to my $1,200,000 maximum, but I need to see how Alice responds to this initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has met my maximum price. There is no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal or dragging out the negotiation further.  This is the best outcome I could hope for in this scenario."
