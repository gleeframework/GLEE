"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $14,000. I think it would be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $12,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is cutting it a bit too close for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,250 is within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower, and it's a risk that Bob could end up paying the full $15,000 from John.
* Accepting the offer at $13,250 saves Bob $1,750 compared to buying from John."
