"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really appreciate. It's something that's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in buying it for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave yourself open to negotiating a lower price with her, potentially saving even more money."
