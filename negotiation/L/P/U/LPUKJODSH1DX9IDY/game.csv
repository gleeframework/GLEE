"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $5,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,500?  This gives you a great deal, and I can still get a reasonable price for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $6,500? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $6,500 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  That's a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still gives you a significant discount. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my budget limit. How about we settle at $7,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the price.",7250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  Let's make this final offer: $7,100.  That's my best and final price.",7100.0,Bob,8,
