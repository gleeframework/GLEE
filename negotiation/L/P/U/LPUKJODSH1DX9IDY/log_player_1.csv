Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $5,000 is far too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $5,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,500?  This gives you a great deal, and I can still get a reasonable price for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $6,500? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$6,500 is still too low for me.  I'm going to counter his offer again in the next round.  I want to see if I can get him closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $6,500 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  That's a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still gives you a significant discount. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my budget limit. How about we settle at $7,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$7,000 is still below what I'm hoping to get for the product, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob. I think there's still room to reach a deal that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the price."", ""product_price"": 7250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  Let's make this final offer: $7,100.  That's my best and final price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price.  John's offer is significantly better, and I don't want to risk losing out on that much money."
