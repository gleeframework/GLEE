,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $9,800 or even $9,900? I really think that's a fair price for the product.",9900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,900 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,200. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated, to be honest. I really want this product, but I don't think $10,200 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. That's the absolute max I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,6,
