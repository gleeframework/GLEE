"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $14,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,000.  Since I can get the product for $12,000 from John, it's more beneficial for me to take that deal now."
