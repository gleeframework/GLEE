Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value.
* **High Anchor:**  $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor point, giving you room to potentially come down a bit while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  You're not just throwing out a number; you're framing it in terms of the ""significant returns"" Bob will experience.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter your offer. Have a strategy in mind for how low you're willing to go. 
* **Consider Alternatives:**  While you have John as a backup, getting a deal done with Bob quickly might be preferable. Factor in the time and effort of a new negotiation."
