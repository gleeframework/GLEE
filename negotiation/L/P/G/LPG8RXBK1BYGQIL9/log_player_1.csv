Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product,  $500000 is significantly lower than my initial assessment.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This price reflects the potential I see in this product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
