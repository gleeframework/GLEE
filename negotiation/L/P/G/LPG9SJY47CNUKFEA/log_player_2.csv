(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too expensive at $120. It's better to try negotiating with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm offering Alice the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is $80. This is my best offer, and if she doesn't accept, I'll buy from John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$110 is still too expensive for me. I'll keep negotiating with Alice, but if she doesn't budge, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm willing to increase my offer to $85, but that's still well below Alice's asking price. If she doesn't accept, I'll have to stick with John's offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$105 is still too high for me. I'll keep negotiating with Alice, but I'm getting close to my limit and might have to go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $90. This is getting very close to my maximum, and I'm hoping Alice will recognize this is a good deal for her. If she doesn't accept, I'll be forced to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

I've reached my limit with Alice. $100 is still too much for me, and I've already made multiple counteroffers. It's time to secure the product and buy it from John for $80."
