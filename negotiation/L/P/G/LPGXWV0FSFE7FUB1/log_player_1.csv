Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than your value for the product ($15,000) but still higher than Bob's value ($8,000). This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer, as he can still get a good deal, and it also gives you a chance to earn a significant amount of money. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you can sell the product to John for your minimum desired price of $15,000, ensuring you don't lose money."
