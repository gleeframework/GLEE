"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This sets the bar and gives me room to negotiate.
* **Value to me:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so this initial offer still provides a significant profit. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer. This round is about gauging his interest and getting a sense of his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I'll try to counteroffer and hopefully find a middle ground. 
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance I can get more from Bob. I want to see if I can push him higher before I go with the safe option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $1,200,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Finding common ground:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us.
* **Strategic compromise:**  By dropping the price, I increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a good profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $900,000 is closer to my minimum but still below it.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I'm running out of rounds, I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum just yet.  There's still a chance I can push Bob higher, especially if he's genuinely interested.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is safe, I'm motivated to see if I can squeeze a slightly better deal out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. I'm dropping the price to $1,100,000, which is just above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by going lower.  It's possible Bob will reject this offer and I'll be forced to sell to John. However, there's also a chance Bob will accept, and I'll get a slightly better deal than John's offer.
* **Time is running out:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to be decisive. This counteroffer is my best chance to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but still not reaching it.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further rounds might not be fruitful, and Bob may continue to offer prices below my minimum. There's a risk of not reaching a deal.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is guaranteed and meets my minimum price. It's the safest and most reliable option at this point.
* **Moving on:** It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
