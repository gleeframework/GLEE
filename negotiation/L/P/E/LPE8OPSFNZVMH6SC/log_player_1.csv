Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that price is strategic. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, giving you a strong fallback position if Bob refuses."
