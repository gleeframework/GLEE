"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You can likely get the product for less than $9,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $9,000, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high. It's important to keep negotiating and try to get a lower price. I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to my initial counteroffer of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $8,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be closer to her acceptable price and lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high. I'm hoping that by continuing to reject her offers, she will eventually come down to a price closer to my preferred range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8850}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again to $8,850. Alice seems to be moving slowly, so I'm raising the offer a bit more to see if I can find a middle ground. It's still below her current offer and closer to my preferred price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offers are getting progressively higher, making it unlikely we will reach a mutually agreeable price. Given that we are already in round 7, the remaining time is limited. It's now more beneficial to buy from John for $10,000, as it's a guaranteed deal within my budget and a more secure option than risking further negotiations with Alice."
