Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while also ensuring I'm making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway and add a small premium to make it a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While he's trying to be more agreeable, he's still offering significantly below my minimum price. I have 6 rounds left and I want to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're sticking to $105.  While I appreciate your persistence, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's try $112.  It's a good compromise that's closer to my desired price and still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway again and add a small premium to make it a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While he's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I have 4 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price. How about we split the difference and agree on $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $107? I'm willing to meet you halfway again and add a small premium to make it a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. We're in round 8 and Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price.  With only 2 rounds left, I don't think I'll be able to negotiate a better price with Bob. It's time to take the guaranteed $120 from John and move on."
