Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, leaving some room for negotiation, but still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, making it likely he'll accept.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm not in a hurry to sell. I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  However, $105 is still a little lower than I'd like to go.  Let's meet in the middle at $110.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle on $107.5? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $107.5 is a reasonable compromise and a significant improvement over selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
