"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
