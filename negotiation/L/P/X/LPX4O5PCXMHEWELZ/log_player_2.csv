"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $150 when you know you can get the same product from John for $120.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product,  $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to consider $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? It's a fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still more than I'm willing to pay, especially since John is selling it for $120. Let's see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
