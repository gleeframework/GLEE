"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product,  $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to consider $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
