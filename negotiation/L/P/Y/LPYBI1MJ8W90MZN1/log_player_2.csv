Alice's offer is far too high.  It's time to counteroffer."

This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous counteroffer, but I'm not going to get close to $1,200,000. Let's try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than my previous offer, but still below Alice's latest price. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also sets a firm limit on what I'm willing to pay.  Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice is still too high, even though she has come down.  It's worth pushing for a lower price one more time, and if she rejects, I'll just buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is my final offer. I'm not going to pay any more than this. If Alice rejects, I'll be happy to buy from John."

Alice is still too high, and I'm not going to play this game any longer.  John's offer is the best deal, and I'm ready to buy from him."
