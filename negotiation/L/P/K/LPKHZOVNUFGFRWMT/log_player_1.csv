"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes my expectation and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that the product is worth at least this much to me, and hopefully, Bob will see its value and be willing to pay a substantial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price point. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up further in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. Hopefully, this will encourage him to get closer to my asking price and we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $920,000 is getting closer, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe we can still reach a more favorable price for me. I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product and if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $940,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing I'm still willing to negotiate, but also demonstrating that I'm firm in my belief that the product is worth more than $920,000. Hopefully, this small increase will encourage Bob to make a final concession and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for, we've been going back and forth for a while, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  $915,000 is a solid price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to push for a higher amount.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $800,000 if this deal falls through."
