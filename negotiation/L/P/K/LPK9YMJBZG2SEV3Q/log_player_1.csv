Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price. What do you say to $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $20 markup is a reasonable starting point. It's not excessively high to scare Bob away, but it leaves you room to potentially lower the price slightly and still make a profit beyond your minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing a ""great deal"" and appealing to Bob's sense of value. This encourages him to consider the offer favorably.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, strategically moving closer to $100 to avoid losing the sale entirely."
