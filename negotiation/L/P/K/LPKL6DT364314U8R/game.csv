"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $10,800? This is still a great deal, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts!",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. How about $10,600? That's a fair compromise and would make this deal happen. Let me know what you think!",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this happen.  $10,600 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,700? This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",10700.0,Alice,5,
