It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and $1,050,000 significantly undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. How about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Alice has come down to $1,090,000, which is closer to my ideal price point and still well below John's price.  It's time to close the deal."
