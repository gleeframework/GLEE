"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and $1,050,000 significantly undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the potential of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's make this easy: $1,090,000, and we have a deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
