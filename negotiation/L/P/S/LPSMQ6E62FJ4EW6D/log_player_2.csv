"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let's try $900000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he could get from John.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm still not sure $875000 is enough for the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you at $885000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could get the product for a lower price from John, Alice is now offering a price that is closer to his maximum budget and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good deal for Bob, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
