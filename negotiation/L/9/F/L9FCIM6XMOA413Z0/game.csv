"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about we meet at $10500? This is still a great deal for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This would be a good deal for both of us and a fair compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price that's very close to your offer. How about we meet at $9800? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for the product. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
