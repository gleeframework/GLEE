"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique item that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still allows room for negotiation. This is a strategy to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to selling the product for $17,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm raising the price from Bob's offer, but it's still lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility. This should encourage Bob to come up with a counteroffer that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within my acceptable range, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. While $15,000 would be preferable, the risk of not closing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for the minimum makes accepting this offer the best option."
