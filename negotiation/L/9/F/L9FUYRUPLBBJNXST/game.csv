"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to offer $1100000 for it, which is still a good price considering its unique nature.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really hoping to stay closer to $1100000.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1200000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not quite ready to go any lower than that. Let me think for a moment... How about we meet at $1250000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit on this sale.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
