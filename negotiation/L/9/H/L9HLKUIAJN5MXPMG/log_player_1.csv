"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your endeavors."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $10,000 is below its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to getting this product, but I can't go above my budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored to his $10,000 budget and unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me. Accepting his offer means a $2,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed purchase."
