Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but I also want to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and positions it as a good deal compared to my fallback option (John at $150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer,  there might be a small window for Bob to negotiate a slightly lower price, still allowing me to earn more than $100."
