Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1750000 is outside of my budget.  Considering the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1250000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob.** I'm still hopeful to get a better price.
* **Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit.** However, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1600000 is still beyond my budget. To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $1350000. This shows my commitment to this deal, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to finalize this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** While it's closer than before, accepting would still result in a loss.
* **We are halfway through the negotiation rounds (5 rounds left).** I'm hopeful that with continued negotiation, I can secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum profit.** However, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming to reach a price that is acceptable to both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1550000 is still outside my budget.  To make progress, I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1350000. This reflects the value I see in this product, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's focus on reaching a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds (4 rounds left).** 
* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price ($1,500,000).**  There's a risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $1,500,000.**  This is a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all. 

**Next Steps:**

I will sell the product to John and secure the desired profit.  While I would have liked to negotiate with Bob to potentially get a higher price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
