"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a fantastic price for a product worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000.  This would be a good middle ground for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
