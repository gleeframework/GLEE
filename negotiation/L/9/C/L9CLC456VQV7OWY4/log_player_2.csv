Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  While $14,000 represents the value I place on this product, I understand your budget constraints. Could we meet in the middle at $12,500?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still do better by continuing to negotiate.  He can potentially get the price down to his target of $10,000 or close to it."
