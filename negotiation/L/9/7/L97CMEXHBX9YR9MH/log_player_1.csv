"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but below my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open ended question:** This encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

**Note:** This is just my initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, considering his initial willingness to pay $10,000. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, I want to maximize my profits.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still below my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:**  Again, I'm focusing on the value proposition to Bob, highlighting the deal he's getting even at $14,000.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm still above my minimum, allowing for additional rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $13,500 is still below my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially considering Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While $15,000 is guaranteed, I'm still hopeful for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer slightly above Bob's current offer. I'll need to be strategic, as I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing a deal with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we settle on $14,250?

```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful not to waste time on offers that are too low.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** While Bob's offers are decreasing, there's still a chance he might increase his offer if I show I'm not desperate to sell.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I can't get a better deal from Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer slightly above Bob's current offer, aiming to push him closer to my minimum while acknowledging the time constraints."

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, the risk of no deal and the guaranteed profit with John make selling to John the more sensible choice at this point."
