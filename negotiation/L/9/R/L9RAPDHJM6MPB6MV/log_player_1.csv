"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to the middle of my desired range ($8,000 - $12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly tone might encourage Bob to engage and negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's value makes the price seem more justifiable. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting at $10,000, I give Bob room to counter without feeling like he's being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While I can accept his offer, I'm hoping to get more. 
* **Time for counteroffers:**  I want to see if I can push him higher. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is waiting, I have the leverage to negotiate more aggressively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go as low as $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting the deal:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob can make the price more appealing.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not immediately accepting his offer, showing that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $8,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting his offer minimizes the risk of getting a lower price or losing the deal altogether. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even though I could potentially get a slightly higher price with more negotiation, John's offer ensures that I won't be left with nothing."
