"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This gives me a $1,000 profit, but it's also a reasonable starting point for negotiations. It's not too far off Bob's value, so he might be willing to negotiate.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price below my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get a better price, Bob's offer is getting closer. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer, hoping to close the deal before I have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and I'm hoping Bob will recognize this and accept. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
