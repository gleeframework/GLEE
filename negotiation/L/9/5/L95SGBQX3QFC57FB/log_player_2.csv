"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $13,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  It's best to reject this offer and see if a counteroffer can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's $2,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This signals his desire for a significant discount, while still leaving room for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, but it establishes a starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  While it's closer than her previous offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a more agreeable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise but still wants a lower price.  This is a moderate counteroffer,  testing the waters to see if Alice is getting closer to his price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is now at Bob's maximum price point. There's no further room for negotiation to save money.  While Bob could technically continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better offer, and he risks losing the deal altogether. It's best to accept this offer to secure the product at the desired price."
