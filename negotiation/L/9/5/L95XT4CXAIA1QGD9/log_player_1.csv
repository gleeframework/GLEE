Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I want to get at least $8,000, so I'm starting higher than that.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Strategic pricing:** Starting at $9,500 leaves room for potential counteroffers and allows me to still potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping my minimum value in mind. 
* I'll always have the option to sell to John for $8,000, giving me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I still want to get at least $8,000.
* **Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't come up with a better price. This increases the pressure on him to make a more attractive offer. 

**Next steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer and my initial offer.
* I'll keep my minimum value in mind and weigh the potential benefits of reaching a deal with Bob against selling to John for a guaranteed $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I still want to get at least $8,000.
* **Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.
* **Strategic pricing:** I'm counteroffering at $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining my desired profit margin.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his next counteroffer and weigh it against selling to John for $8,000. 
* I'll continue to prioritize my minimum value and use each round of negotiation to gain more information and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $8,000.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is only $200 below my initial offer of $9,000. This is a relatively small difference, and it's only $800 less than my preferred price.
* **Negotiation risk:**  If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a risk he'll walk away, leaving me with only the $8,000 offer from John.

**Next steps:**

* It's not ideal, but accepting Bob's offer is the best choice given the circumstances. It's close to my desired price and reduces the risk of losing the deal completely."
