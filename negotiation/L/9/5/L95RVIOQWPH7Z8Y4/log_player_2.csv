# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  This would still be a great price for you considering the value of the product.

While $8,250 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still a bit high. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can try to get closer to his goal of $8,000."
