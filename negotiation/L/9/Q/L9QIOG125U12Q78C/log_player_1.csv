"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to come close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal value by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still maintaining a price that is significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this counteroffer is fair and might encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better offer.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price, especially since John is waiting in the wings with a much higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm again lowering my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility.  I believe $10,000 is a fair compromise, and with John waiting, I don't want to risk losing too much time on this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob or running out of time."
