"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $150. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $100 to you, so you should reject her offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $105, but I'm still looking for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for you. You can get the product from John for $100, so continue negotiating with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115, which would be $122.50. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not willing to go lower than $122.50, and you are only willing to pay a maximum of $100. At this point, it's more beneficial for you to buy the product from John for $100. You're saving $22.50 by doing so."
