"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
