"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm feeling more comfortable with $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  This is a great price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm feeling more comfortable with $9,750.  This is a fair price that is closer to my budget, and I believe it would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Bob,6,
