"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1100000 at this time.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1100000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1300000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
