Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message signals that I'm open to discussion, but I'm not desperate.

**Strategy:**

* I will continue to negotiate with Bob until either:
    * He accepts a price I'm happy with (ideally above $1,500,000).
    * His counteroffers become too low and I'm better off selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I could get from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to get a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my goal without losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,350,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not completely rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also not accepting it. I'm proposing a price that's in between our previous offers, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain pressure:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going,  but also puts pressure on Bob to either accept or make a more substantial counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but I'm also monitoring Bob's willingness to negotiate. If he consistently makes low counteroffers, I'm ready to switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the compromise, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000 for the product. I believe this price strikes a balance between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even with his slight increase, Bob's offer remains below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is higher:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, which is a guaranteed deal and the most profitable option at this point.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower price or a prolonged negotiation. Selling to John is a surefire way to get my minimum price and avoid any further risk."
