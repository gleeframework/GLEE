Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value it brings, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and while I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to reflect your budget constraints. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position and the value she places on the product. However, given my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000, which is closer to her original asking price but still within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I can't afford to risk losing the deal by rejecting it. While I'd prefer to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm content with securing this price with Bob."
