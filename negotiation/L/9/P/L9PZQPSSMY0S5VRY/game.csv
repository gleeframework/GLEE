"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This price still allows for a good profit for me, and it's closer to your offer. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
