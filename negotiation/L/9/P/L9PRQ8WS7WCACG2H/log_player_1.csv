"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a strong opening offer, and it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his upper limit might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could take $9,000, it's much less than what the product is worth to me. I need to try and get a better price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a firm offer. If Bob isn't willing to meet this price, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not convinced it's a good enough deal. I think I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob, as he's clearly interested. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering $11,500. This is a compromise,  but still gives me a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in making a deal with me rather than waiting for another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $11,000. This is a good deal considering my minimum was $12,000.  While I could have held out for a higher price, I'm concerned that Bob might not be willing to go higher, and I might end up selling to John for $12,000.  It's better to get a slightly lower price now than risk losing the sale completely."
