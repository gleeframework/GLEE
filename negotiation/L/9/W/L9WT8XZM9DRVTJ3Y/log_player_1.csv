"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a decent profit. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, so I'm not rushing to sell to him yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than John's offer, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can still get closer to my initial price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering the price to $140. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a good margin. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but not willing to settle for a price too far below my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and we're only four rounds in. I'm happy to accept his offer of $135, as it's significantly better than John's offer and allows me to move on."
