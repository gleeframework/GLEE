"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. You have room to negotiate since your maximum is $1,200,000 and Alice wants $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $1,125,000? This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
