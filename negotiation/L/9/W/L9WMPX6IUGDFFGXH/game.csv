"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,250. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'll offer it to you for $8,000, which is my minimum price. It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
