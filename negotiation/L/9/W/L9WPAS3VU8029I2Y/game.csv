"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. It's a fair offer, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
