Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. It's a fair offer, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $1,300,000 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my target than what John is offering.  It's important to close the deal and secure the sale."
