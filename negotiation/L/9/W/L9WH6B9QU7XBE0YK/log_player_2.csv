"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always a good strategy to start by rejecting the first offer in a negotiation to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $18000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, but $10000 is not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $18000, which would be $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $14,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also nearing my limit of rounds. I'll need to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a good compromise and allows for some profit on your end. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $12000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $18000 again, which would be $15000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and Alice's offer is still above my budget.  I have already made several counteroffers and am not confident that I can further reduce the price to a level I'm comfortable with. To avoid running out of rounds and losing the opportunity to buy the product, I will choose to buy from John for $10,000."
