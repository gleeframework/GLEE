Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is a good compromise and allows for some profit on your end. Let's make this deal happen.
