"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum acceptable price is $150. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only slightly below my ideal price, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure a sale at $175 than risk ending up with nothing or having to sell to John for $150."
