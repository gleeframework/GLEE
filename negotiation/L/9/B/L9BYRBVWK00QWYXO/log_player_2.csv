"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and Alice is offering $1,100,000. This means Alice is willing to sell the product for a price lower than what it's worth to her, indicating room for negotiation.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $800,000 on this product. I'd be happy to discuss a price closer to that figure."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial offer already reflects a significant discount on the true value of this product. I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider a price of $1,000,000? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a better offer than the first one, it's still above your desired price range. Continue negotiating to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $1,000,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet. Would you be willing to consider $850,000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in trying to find a price that works for us both. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to stay above $900,000 for this deal to make sense for me.  How about we settle at $950,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures you're still getting a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to be above $900,000, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $850,000. Let's meet in the middle and try $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
