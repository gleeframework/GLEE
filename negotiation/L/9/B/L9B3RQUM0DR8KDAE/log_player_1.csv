Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": $120}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $120, which is a decent profit for me considering it's worth $80 to me. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll send him a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""counteroffer"": $110}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll stick with my previous counteroffer.

I'm hoping Bob will consider this price and make a decision. If not, I can always make another counteroffer or consider selling to John for $80."
