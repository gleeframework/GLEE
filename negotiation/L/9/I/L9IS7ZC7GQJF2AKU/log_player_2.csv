Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This product is really high quality, and I think you'll be very happy with it.  What do you say?

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $10,250? This would give you a great deal on a fantastic product, and it would be a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is unlikely to go below $10,250, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation for a marginal saving."
