Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise. 
* **Knowing my Backup:** I'm aware of John's offer, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for Counter-Negotiation:**  I believe I can still secure a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering.  
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I have John's offer of $15,000 as a fallback, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** My counter-offer aims to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to move slightly closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a value that is acceptable to me.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging, emphasizing the mutual benefit of reaching a deal.
* **Reasoning for Counter:** I'm clearly stating why I'm rejecting Bob's offer, explaining my position and laying the groundwork for further negotiation. 
* **Flexible Approach:** My counter-offer shows that I'm flexible and willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Risk of Losing a Sale:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower offer from Bob or a breakdown in negotiations.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I know I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not taking a significant risk by accepting Bob's offer.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm accepting a slightly lower price, I might be able to build a relationship with Bob for potential future deals."
