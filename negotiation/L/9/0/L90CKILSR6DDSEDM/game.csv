"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone with your vision and resources. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also giving us both a good deal.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which would be a fair compromise and allow us to both move forward. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $1,050,000, but I need you to meet me at $1,050,000, not just get close to it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
