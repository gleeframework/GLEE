"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $10,000 by you. I understand the importance of this investment for you and would like to extend an exclusive offer. For a limited time, I am willing to sell the product to you at $9,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a price that is only $500 more than its perceived value to you. Don't miss out on this chance to enhance your experience with our product. Should you have any questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the price at your maximum valuation ($10,000) even though she's willing to sell for less.  This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much, potentially leading to a lower counter-offer. Even if she doesn't budge, you're only out $500 compared to John's offer."
