Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds promising, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product's benefits for my business. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
