Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $108 is a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than his maximum price of $120, and only slightly higher than his initial counteroffer of $105. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a reasonable price."
