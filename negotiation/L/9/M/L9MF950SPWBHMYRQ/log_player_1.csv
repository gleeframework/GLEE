Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While this offer aims to maximize your profit, it's important to consider how Bob might perceive the price. There's a chance he might find it unreasonable and walk away.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the initial offer."
