Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I think $1,700,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's counteroffer, it's important to keep negotiating. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more. There's still potential to close the deal for a higher price."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Given that John is willing to buy the product at my desired price, I will sell to John instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
