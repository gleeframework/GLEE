Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the product's worth to Bob, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than John's offer, so I'm not rushing to sell to him yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell below the product's value to me ($1,500,000). I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,600,000. It's still above Bob's offer, but closer to his desired price, making it more likely he'll accept. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer further, and John is also offering the same amount. It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
