Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with my maximum budget, which is $800,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm not willing to pay more than what the product is worth to me."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price, especially since I have a few rounds remaining. It's better to push for a lower price now than regretting it later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $975,000. This is a small increase but shows I'm still serious about buying the product and I'm willing to meet Alice halfway.  With only a few rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and aim for a price we can both agree on."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last round. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it is still over my initial limit.  With only one round left and Alice showing a reluctance to budge further, it's likely that she won't accept my counteroffer. To avoid risking losing the opportunity to buy the product altogether, it's wiser to secure the deal with John at a price within my budget."
