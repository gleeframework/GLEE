,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1100000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a discount, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking of the value I could get from selling it to John, and I'm willing to meet you at $1020000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
