"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better deal than $11,500, even if it takes a few rounds."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price. You can try to push for a lower price again.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower to close the deal."
