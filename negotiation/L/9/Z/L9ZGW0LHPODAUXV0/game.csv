"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  I believe that's fair given its potential but also the risk involved in a newer product like this.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the pricing, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the  unique benefits this product offers and leaves room for a strong return on your investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging it has yet to be proven in the market.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right to recognize this product's potential, and $850,000 still doesn't fully reflect that.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $950,000.  This is a significant concession on my end,  and I believe it's the lowest I can go while ensuring a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, but we're still too far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000, but that's my absolute limit. It represents a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if this works for you.",875000.0,Bob,6,
