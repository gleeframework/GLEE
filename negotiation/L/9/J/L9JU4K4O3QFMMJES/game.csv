"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,5,
