"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product, valued at $15,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and John's offer. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save the $5,000."
