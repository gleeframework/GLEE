Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it can bring to your operations."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a safe $800,000, Bob's valuation of $1,200,000 presents an opportunity to earn significantly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still netting Alice a profit well above her minimum.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""exclusive opportunity,"" ""significant benefit"") helps justify the high price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while keeping the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
