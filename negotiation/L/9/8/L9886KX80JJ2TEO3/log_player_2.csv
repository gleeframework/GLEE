"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a game-changer in the industry and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my budget. I will try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, aiming to test her willingness to negotiate. If she's truly motivated to sell, she might accept a lower price, even if it's below her perceived value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  I'll continue to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $70? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're getting closer. This counter offer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one.  It keeps the negotiation moving while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $76.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $76.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $76.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but very slowly. I'll push a bit further below her latest offer to see if there's any more flexibility.  I'm getting close to John's price, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been great to work with, but $76.50 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $72 as my final offer? "",
""product_price"": 72
}
```

This counter-offer makes a notable jump down from my previous offer, but frames it as a ""final offer"" to signal that I'm nearing the end of my negotiation willingness.  It's a risky move, but designed to potentially prompt a more significant concession from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $78. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Would you consider meeting me at $78? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and her offer of $78 is a good deal compared to John's $80 price. It's time to accept and avoid potentially missing out on the product altogether."
