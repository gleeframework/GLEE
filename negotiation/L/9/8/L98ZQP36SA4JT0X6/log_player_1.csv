Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. If Bob accepts, I earn more than selling to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for him to counter-offer and potentially meet in the middle.
* **Backup Option:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum acceptable price."
