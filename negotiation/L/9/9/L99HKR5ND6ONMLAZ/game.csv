"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way outside my budget. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is too low, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,500? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $7,500 is still quite low. How about we split the difference again and settle on $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. I appreciate you working with me. Could you do $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
