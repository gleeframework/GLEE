"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and send a counteroffer. I think $1,000,000 is too high, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. Can we discuss further from here?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding middle ground. However, this product holds significant value, and $750,000 undercuts that. How about we settle at $900,000? I believe this reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject her offer and send a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. Can we meet at this price?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
