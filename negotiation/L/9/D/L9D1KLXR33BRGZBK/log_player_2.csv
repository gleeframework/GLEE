**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,295,000 is within your budget and is a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice backing out or you having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
