"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $800,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable investment.",800000.0,Alice,5,
