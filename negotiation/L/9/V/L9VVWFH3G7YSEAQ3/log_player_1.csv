"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, aiming for the maximum potential profit. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I'm offering it at a price significantly higher than that. This is a bold opening move that might make Bob reconsider his initial valuation, or at least engage in negotiations.  While unlikely, it also sets a high bar for potential future counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I have ten rounds and can still sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, so I'm in a good position to try and squeeze a better deal out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further compromise while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer balances the need to reach an agreement with the goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his initial counteroffer of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm going to reject his offer again.  I still have six rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price. It's possible Bob will increase his offer, or I can make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap.  The potential for a higher price outweighs the risk of losing the deal to Bob at this point, especially as I have the guaranteed sale to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway. I'm still above my minimum price and hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to Bob than his previous one. 

With five rounds remaining, there's still plenty of time to negotiate, but I'm trying to close the gap and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is offering a higher price than before, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer again. 

I have four rounds remaining, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a strong backup option.  There's still a chance Bob might increase his offer, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer one more time to $1,550,000. This is my last offer that still meets my minimum requirements. With only three rounds remaining, I need to try and close the deal. 

This offer shows a strong commitment to reaching an agreement while still protecting my minimum profit margin. I believe this offer is close enough to Bob's offer that it will be tempting for him to accept, especially given the limited time remaining in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is not willing to increase his offer, and I'm running out of time. I only have two rounds remaining, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option at this point.  It guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who is unlikely to meet my requirements."
