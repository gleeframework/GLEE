{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it has great potential for your company. My asking price is $1,450,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **It's a strong starting point:** It's significantly above my minimum, showing I'm confident in the value of the product.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value, increasing the chances he'll engage. 
* **It sets the tone for a win-win negotiation:** I'm showing I'm open to discussion, but also not willing to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.**  I won't sell the product at a loss.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.** I still believe I can get a better price from Bob, considering the product is worth more to him.
* **Selling to John is a last resort.**  While it guarantees a profit, it's a less desirable outcome than securing a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be open to considering $1,400,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while leaving room for us both to be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to compromise but not cave in.
* **Counter-offer is still below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Message is positive and collaborative:** I reiterate my willingness to work with Bob and find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $1,380,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.**  This ensures I make a profit on the sale.
* **It's a relatively small step down from my last counteroffer.**  This shows I'm willing to compromise without significantly lowering my expectations.
* **Selling to John is a less desirable outcome.**  While it guarantees a profit, it's a lower profit than I can achieve with Bob.

At this point, it's likely Bob is close to his maximum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a good deal and avoids risking further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a breakdown in the negotiation."
