"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, as I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product.  It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good start, but I'm aiming for more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's worth seeing if we can push it a little further. There are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still confident I can get a good deal. I want to find a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm only getting $50,000 more than John's offer. However, I've already rejected Bob's last two offers, and with only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,050,000 than to risk losing the deal altogether and ending up with just $1,000,000."
