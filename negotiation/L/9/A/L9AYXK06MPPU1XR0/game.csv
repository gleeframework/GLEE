"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to me is significant, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $8,000 for the product?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,000?  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
