"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price significantly lower than its true worth. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $950,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This price still gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000, so I'm thinking $825,000 is a fair price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $825,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference between our last two offers. I'm proposing $887,500. This still represents a significant savings for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is closer to my target price. Let's see if we can get to a deal.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we meet halfway between $850,000 and $887,500? I'm proposing $868,750. This would be a great compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",868750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise, but $868,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is my initial offer from round 4. I'm hoping we can get to a deal at this price.",825000.0,Bob,8,
