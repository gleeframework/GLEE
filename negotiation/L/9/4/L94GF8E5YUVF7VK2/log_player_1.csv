Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price significantly lower than its true worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $950,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This price still gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000, so I'm thinking $825,000 is a fair price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer, $825,000 is still too far below my desired value.  I'm going to push for a higher price and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $825,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference between our last two offers. I'm proposing $887,500. This still represents a significant savings for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is closer to my target price. Let's see if we can get to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we meet halfway between $850,000 and $887,500? I'm proposing $868,750. This would be a great compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 868750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise, but $868,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is my initial offer from round 4. I'm hoping we can get to a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's a better deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
