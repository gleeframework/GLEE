Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Direct Offer:** I clearly state my offer, making it easy for Bob to understand. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open.  I'm prepared to lower my price if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than $150. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a good offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $110 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm willing to compromise slightly by lowering my price from $120 to $110. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Clear Counteroffer:** I explicitly state my counteroffer of $110, making it clear what I'm asking for.
* **Justification:** I provide a brief explanation (needing to be closer to $110) to help Bob understand my position.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer, while keeping the negotiation open.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't sell for less than my minimum.  

I'll keep negotiating with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price. If I can't reach an agreement, I'm still confident I can sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $105? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $5, showing I'm willing to be flexible. 
* **Fairness Argument:** I appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by suggesting a price that's ""fair for both of us."" 
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

This strategy aims to find a price closer to my desired price while still keeping the negotiation open.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I don't think $105 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go lower than $150.  

Considering that John is willing to buy the product for $150, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't risk selling for a price that's too low."
