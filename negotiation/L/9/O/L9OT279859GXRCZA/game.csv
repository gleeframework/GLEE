"I understand you're close to your budget limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $990000. However, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my own budget. My counteroffer is $1075000. I think this is as low as I can go while still making a reasonable profit.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
