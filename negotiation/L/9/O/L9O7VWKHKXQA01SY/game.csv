"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to be at $10,750.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
