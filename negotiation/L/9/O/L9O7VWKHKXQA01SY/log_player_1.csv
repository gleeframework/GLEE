"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's more than fair for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a strong starting point:

* **Fair Price:** $12,000 is a good starting point as it's more than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob and the fairness of the offer.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message encourages Bob to engage in a conversation and negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I've already made a concession, and I'm hoping that Bob will come closer to my desired price in the next round.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to be at $10,750.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
