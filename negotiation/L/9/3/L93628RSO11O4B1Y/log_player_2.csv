You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $11,000.  There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to make a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your target price."

Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still above your ideal range. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer gives you another chance to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $11,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still above your ideal price, but it's getting closer.  At this point, it's likely she won't go lower, and buying from John for $12,000 would be more expensive. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product while still saving some money compared to buying from John."
