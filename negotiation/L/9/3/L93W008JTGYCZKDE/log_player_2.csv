It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $900,000."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if she doesn't come down."

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price considering my maximum budget is $1,000,000. It's likely I can't get a significantly better deal by continuing to negotiate, so I'll accept her offer."
