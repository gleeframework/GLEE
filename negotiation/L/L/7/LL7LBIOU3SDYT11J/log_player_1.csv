Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Starting high allows for negotiation and leaves room for you to potentially secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value by calling it a ""fantastic deal,"" potentially influencing Bob's perception. 
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims high. It's possible Bob will outright reject the offer without countering. However, the potential for increased profit outweighs the risk of losing the sale to Bob in this scenario."
