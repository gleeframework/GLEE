# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, I'm hoping to get the product for closer to $10,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $11,000, Bob saves $1,000 compared to buying from John. This is a good deal for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $12,000."
