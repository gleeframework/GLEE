"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, I'm hoping to get the product for closer to $10,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
