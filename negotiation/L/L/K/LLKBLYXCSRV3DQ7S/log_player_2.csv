"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which I believe is worth more than $1,500,000 to you. After careful consideration and evaluation of its unique features and benefits, I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special introductory price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount compared to its market value, making it a fantastic investment for you.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I am confident that this product will not only meet but exceed your expectations. Should you require any further information or have questions about the product, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $1,500,000."
