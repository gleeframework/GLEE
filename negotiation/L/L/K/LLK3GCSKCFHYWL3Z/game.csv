"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment. Let's work together to make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm eager to make a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
