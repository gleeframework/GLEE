"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make the price seem more justifiable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can't pay more than $12,000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation. I'm willing to risk losing a round and potentially a counteroffer from Bob to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,500. This reflects the value I've placed on the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:** I'm showing Bob that I'm listening and understand his constraints.
* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price but still keeping it above my minimum, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12,800 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is closer to my desired price and is significantly better than selling to John for $12,000. While I might be able to push for a higher price in the next round, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'm not willing to risk that. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price without further negotiation."
