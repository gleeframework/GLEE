Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price to John ($15,000) maximizes the potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **High Anchor Price:** This high initial price sets an anchor in Bob's mind, potentially making him more receptive to a slightly lower counteroffer if he tries to negotiate.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the message implies the value of the product, it leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob outright rejects this initial price, there might still be a chance to negotiate downward slightly while staying above your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward if Bob negotiates, but don't go below $15,000 as you have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
