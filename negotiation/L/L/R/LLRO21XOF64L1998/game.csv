"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $17,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $15,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a certain price, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $15,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",15250.0,Bob,4,
