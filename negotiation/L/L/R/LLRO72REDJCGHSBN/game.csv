"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe a fairer price is in order.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you think $800,000 is a fair price, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, my budget is closer to $850,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. What do you think is a fair price for you?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we settle right between our last two offers at $875,000?  That's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end.  Time is valuable to both of us. My final offer is $887,500. This keeps us near the middle ground and ensures a quick deal.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",887500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to pressure me, but I'm not budging. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but that's as low as I'll go. If you're serious about getting this deal done, I expect you to meet me at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",915000.0,Alice,9,
