"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's desired price range. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's preferred price range.  While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, it's still not a good deal compared to the $1,500,000 price from John. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate you coming down to $1,300,000, it's still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's preferred price range. At this point, continuing negotiations with Alice seems unlikely to result in a price lower than John's offer.  To avoid further negotiation and secure the product within a reasonable budget, Bob should purchase the product from John for $1,500,000."
