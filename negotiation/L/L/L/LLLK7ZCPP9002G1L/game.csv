"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down to $1,300,000, it's still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
