"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This would give you a good deal and me a fair return. Let's see if we can close this deal!",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  $9,800 is a bit too low for me at this point, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10,250? This is my final offer, as we're running out of time. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm willing to take a small loss to get the product, but I need to make sure it's within my means.",9000.0,Bob,6,
