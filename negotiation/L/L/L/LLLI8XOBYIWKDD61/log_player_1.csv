"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like it's a good opportunity. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to explore a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, $9,500 is still below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Negotiation room:**  I have 8 rounds left to potentially get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000, there's a chance I can get a higher price from Bob through continued negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll try to find a price point that's still attractive to Bob but closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This would give you a good deal and me a fair return. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price closer to my minimum.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone, highlighting the ""good deal"" Bob would get and using language that emphasizes closing the deal.
* **Room for negotiation (but less):** While I'm offering a lower price, it's still above what Bob wants to pay. This leaves room for further negotiation, but it's a smaller window than before.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing risk and reward:** I'm trying to find a price that maximizes my earnings while still keeping Bob interested and avoiding a stalemate.
* **Moving closer to my minimum:** I'm gradually decreasing the price, but I'm still keeping it above my minimum.
* **Staying flexible:** I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'm also aware of the time constraint and the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is ticking:** We're already halfway through the rounds, and I don't want to risk running out of time.
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll try to find a price point that's still attractive to Bob but closer to my target. 
* I'll emphasize the value of the product and the limited time remaining to try and convince Bob to raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  $9,800 is a bit too low for me at this point, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10,250? This is my final offer, as we're running out of time. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm putting pressure on Bob by making this my ""final offer.""  This emphasizes the limited time and encourages him to accept.
* **Splitting the difference (again):**  I'm once again offering a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value and time:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the limited time remaining in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing risk and reward:**  I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing my earnings and getting a deal done before time runs out.
* **Moving closer to my minimum:**  I'm slowly decreasing the price but still keeping it above my minimum.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm using the time constraint as a motivator to encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm willing to take a small loss to get the product, but I need to make sure it's within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I have only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While Bob is trying to compromise, his offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed deal with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John eliminates any risk of losing money or running out of time before reaching a satisfactory deal with Bob.
* **Securing the best outcome:**  While I'm open to negotiation,  $15,000 is my target, and John is offering that amount. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing with Bob could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, so it's best to take the guaranteed deal now."
