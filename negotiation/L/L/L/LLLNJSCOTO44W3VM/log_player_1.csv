Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value you placed on it and my needs. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Given my initial offer of $850,000 and your valuation, I believe a price of $900,000 would be fair and allow us to close the deal. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
