"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer. Let me know if you're interested!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value you placed on it and my needs. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I have to be honest, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value I placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Given my initial offer of $850,000 and your valuation, I believe a price of $900,000 would be fair and allow us to close the deal. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and meet you at $925,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000 for the product, and I believe this price fairly reflects both our needs. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement with this final compromise.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $910,000. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $920,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close to a deal! I understand you're hesitant to go lower, but I'm still limited by my budget. I'm willing to offer $915,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise considering your needs and my limitations. Let's close this deal and finalize the purchase.",915000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle, and I'm offering the product to you for $915,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",915500.0,Alice,9,
