Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still above Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Start negotiations:** Initiating with a lower price shows willingness to negotiate, potentially encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Leave room for bargaining:**  A significant gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial price.
* **Maintain optionality:** If Bob rejects, you can still consider John's offer or make further counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer represents a compromise.  It's higher than Bob's last offer but still lower than my ideal price. This approach:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  It demonstrates flexibility and an interest in reaching a deal.
* **Aims for a middle ground:** The price sits between Bob's last offer and my ideal, potentially encouraging a deal.
* **Leaves room for potential compromise:** If Bob rejects, there's still space for negotiation while keeping my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Although I would prefer to negotiate further, given the risk of continuing to negotiate downwards, I will sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I reach my minimum value."
