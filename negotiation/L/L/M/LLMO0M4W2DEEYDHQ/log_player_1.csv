Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($100) and hopefully, a bit lower than what Bob might be willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John for $100 gives me a safety net and allows me to be bolder in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price that's closer to my desired range and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John is Still an Option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $100 gives me the leverage to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a little too low for me. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $95 is a compromise, offering a price halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value for Bob, focusing on the ""good deal"" aspect to encourage him to accept.
* **Still Above My Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum selling price of $100, ensuring I'm not losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I've already seen it for $80 from another seller, so I'm trying to stay within budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower price, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $100.
* **John Offers a Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is my minimum requirement and provides a safe and profitable outcome."
