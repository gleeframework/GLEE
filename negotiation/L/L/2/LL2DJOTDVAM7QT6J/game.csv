"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about we meet at $1,075,000, but I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about we meet exactly in the middle at $1,037,500? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
