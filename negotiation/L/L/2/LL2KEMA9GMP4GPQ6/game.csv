"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500?  This gives us both a fair price and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,4,
