"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly less than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great value for you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial goal, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good compromise and allows me to avoid potentially losing the sale to John. I'm also confident that with more experience, I can better negotiate in the future and achieve higher prices."
