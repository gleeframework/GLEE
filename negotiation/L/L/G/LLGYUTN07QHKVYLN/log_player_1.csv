"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's estimated value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, making it seem like a better deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, but still positions me as the one holding the upper hand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement within this range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I have 10 rounds to close a deal, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  
* **Selling to John is still a safe option:**  If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can always sell to John and secure my minimum price.

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,400,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This offer is a significant jump from Bob's last offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows that I am willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this deal would still be advantageous for him, even at the higher price.
* **Setting a Deadline:** The mention of finalizing a deal adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your offer and am willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I have several rounds left to continue pushing for a better price.  
* **Selling to John is a safe alternative:**  While I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet, selling to John at $1,500,000 is always a secure option.

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,400,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,375,000? This represents a fair middle ground, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm open to compromise while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair middle ground,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,360,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $1,360,000 is still slightly below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There are only four rounds remaining.  If I reject this offer, I risk losing time and potentially having to settle for a lower price later on.
* **Security of Selling to John:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if I need to, so this is a secure choice. 

It's a good time to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
