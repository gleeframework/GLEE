"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it for $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still gives you a great value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
