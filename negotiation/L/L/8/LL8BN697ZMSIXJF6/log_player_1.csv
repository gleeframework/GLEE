Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can offer you $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. Let's try $100 instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $120.  I'm also concerned that if I accept his offer, he might make another counteroffer in the next round, potentially forcing me to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $103 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $103
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $120, I'm starting to feel the pressure.  Bob's offer of $103 is only $2 away from my last counteroffer, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob might go back down to $100 or even lower.  It's time to accept the deal and secure the sale."
