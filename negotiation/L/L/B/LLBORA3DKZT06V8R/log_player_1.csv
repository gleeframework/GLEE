Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, and I'm confident you'll be extremely satisfied with it."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to get as close as possible to our minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us a chance to still sell above our minimum. 
* **Secure a Quick Sale:** John represents a guaranteed sale at $15,000. Offering it to Bob slightly below this price might encourage him to buy quickly before we move on to John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his product valuation."
