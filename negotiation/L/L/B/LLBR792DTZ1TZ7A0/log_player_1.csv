{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been negotiating for a while, and while I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, I'm running out of time.  I have only 4 rounds left, and selling to John will give me a lower return.  $12,750 is a good price, and it's better than the $12,000 I'd get from John."
