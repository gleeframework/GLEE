"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal considering the value I place on this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. Can we consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,500,000?  This would allow me to achieve my minimum price, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know if this works for you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
