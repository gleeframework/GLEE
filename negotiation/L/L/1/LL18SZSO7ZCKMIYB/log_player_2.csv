"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I know you'd get a lot of use out of it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
