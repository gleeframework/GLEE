Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I'd be happy to discuss it further, I'm offering it to you at a price of $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Confident but not Aggressive:** The message aims to be persuasive by highlighting Bob's potential gain and showing a willingness to talk, rather than being overly aggressive. 

By setting the initial price at $120, we increase the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob at a price significantly higher than what John is offering."
