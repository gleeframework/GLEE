"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm confident that the product's value will only increase over time. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I can do $900,000, and I think that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm thinking of a price between our last two offers, so I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am interested in the product, but only at the right price.  How about $910,000 and we have a deal?",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of meeting you at the midpoint between our last two offers, so I'm offering it to you for $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can shake on it.",912500.0,Alice,7,
