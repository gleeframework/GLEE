Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm confident that the product's value will only increase over time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm thinking of a price between our last two offers, so I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am interested in the product, but only at the right price.  How about $910,000 and we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 910000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of meeting you at the midpoint between our last two offers, so I'm offering it to you for $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can shake on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is practically splitting the difference on each round. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and risking getting closer to John's price isn't worth the potential savings. Accepting at $912,500 is a good deal."
