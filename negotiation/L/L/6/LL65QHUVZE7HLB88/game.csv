"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
