Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, which is important.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  You're offering the product at a price lower than what Bob values it at, giving him an incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You have some flexibility to negotiate if Bob counters. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
 
I'm offering $85, which is still below Bob's perceived value of $100 and also above my minimum. This gives us a chance to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $77 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm not confident Bob will budge further, and I don't want to risk a long negotiation.  I'm going to sell to John for $80, which is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum."
