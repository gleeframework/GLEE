"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I'm extending this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $95. This is a special offer tailored for you based on its high worth to you, which I understand to be $100. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is clearly trying to oversell the product and inflate its value to you. While her offer is within your $100 limit, you can likely get a better price by rejecting it. This will lead you to buy from John for $100, which is still better than Alice's $95."
