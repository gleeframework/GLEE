Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and offering a reason for the price, you make it seem less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Showing flexibility and willingness to discuss can encourage Bob to engage, even if he initially finds the price high. 
* **Alternative Option (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, mentioning a public listing implies you have other options if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's essential to be mindful of not appearing unreasonable, as this could lead Bob to walk away entirely."
