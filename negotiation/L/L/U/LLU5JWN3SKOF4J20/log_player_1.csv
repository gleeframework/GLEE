Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $11,000 is too low."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $11800. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd like to get a bit more, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which meets my minimum."
