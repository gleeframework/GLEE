Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that can greatly benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (still well above our minimum). 
* **Alternative Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's no pressure to go below that.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring we don't lose the sale entirely."
