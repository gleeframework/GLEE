"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay up to $7,500 for this item. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you valuing the product.  While $7,500 is close, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200. This reflects the product's true worth and allows for some flexibility for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8200}
