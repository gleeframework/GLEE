"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $900,000 to start the negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $800,000, which is my absolute limit. This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still below my target. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",820000.0,Alice,5,
