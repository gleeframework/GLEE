{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's valuation, giving me some room to negotiate.  I'm also emphasizing the mutual value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to explore some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $1,400,000. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,520,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's slightly below my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold and still a good deal. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, and Jhon is only offering my minimum price.  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal entirely."
