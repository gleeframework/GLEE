"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget allows me to only pay up to $10000 for it. Would you be willing to adjust the price accordingly?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. Would you be open to that?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
