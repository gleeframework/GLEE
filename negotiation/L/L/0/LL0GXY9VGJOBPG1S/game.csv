"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $1,100,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand we're getting close, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the value I bring to the table. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This price reflects a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While I'm willing to compromise, $1,050,000 remains outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000 for the product. This price reflects a significant move towards your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our respective needs. Let's see if we can close this deal with a final agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",990000.0,Alice,7,
