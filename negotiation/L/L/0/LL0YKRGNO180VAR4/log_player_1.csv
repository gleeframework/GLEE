"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer ($1,500,000) to gauge Bob's interest.  Since I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,000,000, I can afford to be aggressive in the initial stages. 

This high offer also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested, potentially leading to a higher final price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the same as John's, it's still too low for me.  I believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000, and I'm not ready to sell at that price just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a higher price than Bob's initial offer. This compromise could encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my desired price, but $1,100,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to continue to counteroffer in hopes of reaching a more favorable price. With John's offer as a safety net, I can afford to be patient and see if I can close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to narrow the gap between my offer and Bob's.  A counteroffer of $1,150,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.  We're getting closer to a potential deal, and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
