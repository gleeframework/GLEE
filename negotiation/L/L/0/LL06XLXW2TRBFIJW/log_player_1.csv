"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards without feeling like I'm giving away too much.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to try and convince him to pay more.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Even though Bob's offer is low, he is interested in the product. This indicates that there's room for negotiation.
* **More rounds to explore:** I have several rounds left, and I can counter Bob's offer and try to reach a more favorable price.  

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I can't go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. $12,500 is a more realistic middle ground.
* **Emphasize value again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to pay more.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm ending with a positive tone and willingness to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time to close the deal:** I'm nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I need to be strategic.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I can still sell to John for a much better price. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer. I'm going to try and push for a price closer to my minimum to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's the best I can do while still making this worthwhile for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  $12,000 is my final compromise. It's a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's last offer, showing my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I highlight my willingness to compromise to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Finality:** I leave the message open-ended, giving Bob the chance to accept or make a final counteroffer."
