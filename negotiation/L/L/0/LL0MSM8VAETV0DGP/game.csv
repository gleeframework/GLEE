"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me and the potential for a mutually beneficial relationship.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,5,
