Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know would be incredibly valuable for your needs. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob helps justify the high price. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a premium price while having the safety net of John's offer."
