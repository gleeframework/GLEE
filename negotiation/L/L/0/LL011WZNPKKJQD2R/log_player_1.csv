Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is just too low for me. How about $13,500?  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about $12800? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is slightly above my minimum price and closer to the deal I wanted to make.  It's better than selling to John for $12,000, and I think I can still get a better deal in the next round or two."
