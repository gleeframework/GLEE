"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's premium features and benefits.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $11,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
