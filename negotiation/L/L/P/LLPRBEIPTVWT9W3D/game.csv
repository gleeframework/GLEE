"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'd be willing to pay that amount.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 for this.  Let's find a middle ground, I'm sure we can reach a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $9,500 is a more reasonable price for me. I'd be willing to pay that amount.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm offering $9,000, and that's my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
