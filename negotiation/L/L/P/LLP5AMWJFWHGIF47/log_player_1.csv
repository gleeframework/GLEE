Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $120 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a profit for Alice.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" adds a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly."
