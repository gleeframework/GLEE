Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's worth, making a higher price more palatable.
* **Alternative:** Mentioning that you have other interested parties (even if you don't) can sometimes encourage a buyer to act quickly. 

**It's important to note:** This is just an opening offer.  Bob's response will determine your next move. Be prepared to potentially negotiate down, but always keep your minimum price in mind!"
