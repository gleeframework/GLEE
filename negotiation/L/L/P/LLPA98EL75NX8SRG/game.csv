,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $165. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $142.50? That would be a fair price for both of us.",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $155? It's a fair price that still leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $155 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference again and settle on $150? It's a fair price, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  ",150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go any lower, Bob. I really need to make at least $160 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to meet you at $160, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",160.0,Alice,7,
