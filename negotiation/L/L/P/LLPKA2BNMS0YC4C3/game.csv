"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11,000?  I'm confident that this is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to pay $10,250 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $10,750 for this to work. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",10750.0,Alice,5,
