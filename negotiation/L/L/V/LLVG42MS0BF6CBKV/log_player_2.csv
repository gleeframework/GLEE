"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a game-changer in its field and truly stands out with its innovative features and high-quality craftsmanship. Given its value and what it can offer you, I believe it's worth more than just $10,000. Considering its worth to you and the market value, I propose a special introductory price of $15,000 for you today. This is an exclusive opportunity to own this product at a premium rate before we launch it to the public at a higher price. I understand this might be a significant investment, but I assure you, it will be a valuable addition to your collection or business. Let's discuss how we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering.  It makes no sense to pay more than you need to."
