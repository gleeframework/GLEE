"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a respectable offer, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000.  This reflects the unique potential I see this product offering you.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still feel that $1,850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
