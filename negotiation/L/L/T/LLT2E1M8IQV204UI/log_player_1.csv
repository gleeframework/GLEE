Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to build rapport.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-offers:**  I'm expecting Bob to counter, so I'm not setting a final price right away. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Counter-offer Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he is still interested. This opens the door for me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired range, hopefully finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still allows me to cover my costs and hopefully remains within your budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that is higher than his initial counter.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate my willingness to negotiate and emphasize the value of the product.
* **Positive Language:** The tone is still friendly and cooperative, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**  I'll wait for Bob's response to see if he's willing to compromise further. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept John's offer of $15,000 or try to negotiate further with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets your needs and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting this offer allows me to build a relationship with Bob. This could lead to future deals where I might be able to get a better price.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and could potentially lead to Bob losing interest.

**Next Steps:** While I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale and potentially open up future opportunities with him."
