"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time, so I'm not in a desperate situation. This high initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for a price significantly below my minimum value. I will reject his offer and counter with a price that is more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is a compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell below $1,200,000  unless I'm running out of time. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is closer to my minimum value but still leaves some room for negotiation. We are halfway through the rounds, so I need to be more flexible to avoid selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but we're getting closer. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price, as I still have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with my minimum value of $1,200,000.  With only a few rounds remaining, I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'm still willing to sell to John at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my minimum price and Bob has rejected my offer. While I'm willing to negotiate further, I only have two rounds left. It's likely that Bob is unwilling to go higher than $1,100,000 and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than what John is offering.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
