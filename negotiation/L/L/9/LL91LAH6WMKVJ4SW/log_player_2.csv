"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. It's worth trying to get closer to his target price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. After reconsidering, I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price and $850,000 is still too high. He should continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $800,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is significantly lower than her initial offer of $900,000 and closer to Bob's target price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice backing out entirely or holding firm at $825,000.  It's better to accept this offer and save a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
