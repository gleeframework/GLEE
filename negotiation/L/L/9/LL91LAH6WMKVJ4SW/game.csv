"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I hope you'll consider this offer. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. After reconsidering, I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $850,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $800,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
