"I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $1,000,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I understand your perspective on value, but this product is truly unique and has the potential to be worth much more to you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $825,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
