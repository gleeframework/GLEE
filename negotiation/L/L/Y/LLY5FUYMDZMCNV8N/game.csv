"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
