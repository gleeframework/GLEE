"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,800,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from a starting offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals you're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintain a respectful tone to foster a positive negotiation environment.
* **Clear Intention:**  Clearly state your counteroffer and express continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good, but the offer is still $200,000 more than John's price.  There's room to negotiate further before considering accepting her offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but the price is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $1,150,000.  I think that's a fair offer, given the market value of similar products."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but not by a huge amount. This shows willingness to negotiate but also firmness on our budget.
* **Market Justification:**  By mentioning ""market value,"" we're subtly reminding Alice that there are other options available (John's offer).
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise closer to the middle ground between Alice's previous offer and our target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $1,350,000, which is still $150,000 more than John's offer. While Alice might be willing to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's offer.  At this point, buying from John is the more financially sound decision."
