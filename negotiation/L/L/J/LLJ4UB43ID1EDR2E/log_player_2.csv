Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

You can still potentially get a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could try to counter again,  $10,900 is a good deal considering the product is worth $12,000 to you. It's also likely Alice won't go any lower."
