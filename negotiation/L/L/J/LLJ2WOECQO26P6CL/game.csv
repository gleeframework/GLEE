"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain our pricing strategy. I am unable to accept $10,000 for the product. However, I would like to offer you a special deal: we can discuss additional benefits or services included with the purchase that could make the value worth more than just the price. Please let me know if this is something you'd be open to exploring.",11600.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in additional services.  To be frank, $11,000 is the absolute highest I'm willing to go.  If we can make a deal work at that price, I'm ready to buy today.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,200 for the product. This price includes a 30-day satisfaction guarantee and free shipping. I hope this proposal works for you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
