Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but my goal is to achieve a fair reflection of the product's worth. I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about $975,000? I believe this demonstrates my flexibility while still valuing the product appropriately.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
