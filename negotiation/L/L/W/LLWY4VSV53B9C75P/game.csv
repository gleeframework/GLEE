"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  However, $850,000 is a significant gap from what I can accept. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but my goal is to achieve a fair reflection of the product's worth. I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about $975,000? I believe this demonstrates my flexibility while still valuing the product appropriately.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $975,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a significant offer for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering we're both trying to find a compromise.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're both looking for a fair compromise. To show I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'm willing to accept $950,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a balanced outcome for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,7,
