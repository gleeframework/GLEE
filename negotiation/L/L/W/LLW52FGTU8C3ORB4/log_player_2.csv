"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $9,500. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a discounted price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** You value the product at $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500. 
* **You can get it cheaper from John:** John is willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which is still within your budget.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you have the opportunity to negotiate with John or potentially find an even better deal elsewhere."
