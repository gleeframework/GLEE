"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go as low as $15,000.  Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'd be willing to come down to $16,000. This would be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $15,000 would be a fair price for both of us. Could you consider coming down to that amount?
