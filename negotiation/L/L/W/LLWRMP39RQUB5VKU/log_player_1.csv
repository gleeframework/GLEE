{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. I think this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a good profit. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Offering it for the maximum ($120) risks Bob rejecting it outright. This offer balances the potential for higher profit with the security of a guaranteed sale to John at $80."
