,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,425,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let me know if this works for you.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
