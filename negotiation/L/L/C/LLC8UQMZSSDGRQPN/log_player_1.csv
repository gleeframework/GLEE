Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,425,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1425000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is very tempting, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $1,380,000? I'm hoping we can close the gap and make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that we may not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  To avoid potentially losing more time and ending up with a lower price than I'm willing to accept, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I receive my minimum desired price."
