"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but we're unable to match it due to the cost of production and the value we place on our products. However, I'd like to propose a compromise. Would you be open to considering $140 for the product? This still allows us to cover our costs while offering a better deal than our initial offer to you.",140.0,Alice,3,
