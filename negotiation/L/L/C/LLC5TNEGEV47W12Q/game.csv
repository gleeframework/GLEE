"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Consider the value of the product and the fact that I could easily sell it to another buyer for a much higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",800000.0,Alice,3,
