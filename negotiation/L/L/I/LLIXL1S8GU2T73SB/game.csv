"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, thanks for coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
