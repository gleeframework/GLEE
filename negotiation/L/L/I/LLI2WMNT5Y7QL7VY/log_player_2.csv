"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a competitive price of $19,000. I believe this product will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $19,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}

This is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but allows room for negotiation. It's important to appear serious about the purchase but not overly eager."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what it's worth to me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above your top price and what John offers. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. However, $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** Moving closer to Alice's price shows you're engaged and serious.
* **Stay below your limit:** The offer is still under your $12,000 maximum, giving you bargaining room.
* **Strategic positioning:** This counter-offer is a significant jump from your initial $10,000, but not so high that it seems unrealistic. It aims to bring Alice closer to a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your counteroffer, I can't go lower than $14,000 for this product.  It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Her language (""final offer"") suggests she won't budge further.
* **Too close to your limit:** $14,000 is only slightly below your maximum, leaving you with a minimal saving. 
* **Guaranteed alternative:** John offers the product for $12,000, a guaranteed saving of $2,000 compared to Alice's final offer.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  You've tried to reach a mutually agreeable price, but her final offer isn't beneficial enough. Buying from John ensures you get the product at the best price."
