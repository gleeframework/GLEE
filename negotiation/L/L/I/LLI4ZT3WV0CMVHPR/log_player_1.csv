Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,200,000.  I'm offering you the first chance to acquire it at this price."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. Aiming for $1,200,000 allows for potential negotiation down while still securing a significant profit.
* **Value-based language:**  The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, rather than just stating a number.
* **Exclusivity:** By emphasizing Bob's ""exclusive opportunity,"" you create a sense of urgency and potential loss if he declines.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, but the phrasing leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you have any insight into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you might adjust your approach. 
* **Market information:** While not provided, real-world scenarios often involve market research to gauge acceptable price ranges.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter, and have a negotiation strategy in mind. Your bottom line is $800,000, but always aim higher initially."
