{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $75 for the product. I understand if this isn't possible, but I thought I'd give it a try. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I am willing to hold out for a better price. It is still possible to reach an agreement with Bob, and I can still make more money than I would from selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $75 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
