"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make it worth your while. I'll sell it to you for $12,000. It's a steal at this price, considering how much value it will bring to your life! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and you have another seller (John) offering the product at that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for potential counter-offers or can proceed with John if necessary."
