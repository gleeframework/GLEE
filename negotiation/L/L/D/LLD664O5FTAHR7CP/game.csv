"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $130? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I think I can do a bit better. How about $125.50? That's still a good compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to take the product at that price.",125.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $125.50 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $128. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go down to $128, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $128. How about $124?",124.0,Bob,6,
