{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay more. It also gives you a good chance to secure a decent price without risking selling to John for $150 right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below what you'd prefer.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a higher price. You can make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $130? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I think I can do a bit better. How about $125.50? That's still a good compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to take the product at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd prefer. It's worth seeing if you can push for a higher price one last time before selling to John.  You can make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $125.50 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $128. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go down to $128, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $128. How about $124? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $124. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $124
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting too close to your minimum, and there's a risk of continuing to negotiate and ending up with a price you're not happy with.  John is offering you a guaranteed $150, which is significantly more than Bob's latest offer.  It's time to cut your losses and sell to John."
