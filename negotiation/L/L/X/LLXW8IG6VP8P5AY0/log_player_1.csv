"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. This price is significantly above my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value.  It's a good starting point to see if we can quickly reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can still secure a better price.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal. Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and I have time to continue negotiating. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1340000}
```

I'm going to offer a price slightly lower than my previous counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above Bob's last offer. The goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
