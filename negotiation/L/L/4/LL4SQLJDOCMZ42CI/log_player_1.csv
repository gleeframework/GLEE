Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's perceived value is $80, starting high leaves space for potential counter-offers.  
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 guarantees you won't go below that price. 

This strategy aims for the highest possible profit while still being potentially appealing to Bob."
