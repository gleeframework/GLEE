Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high (like $300) will likely make Bob immediately walk away.  A price of $175 is a reasonable markup that Bob might still consider.
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer helps us gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat-out rejects this price, we know we might need to come down closer to $150. If he counters, it opens the door for negotiation. 

Remember, even if Bob rejects this initial offer, we have John as a backup buyer at $150."
