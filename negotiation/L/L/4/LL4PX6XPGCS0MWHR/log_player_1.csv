Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offer:**  The offer is not too aggressive, giving Bob an opportunity to counter without feeling like he's being pushed around.
* **Plan B:**  I'm ready to move on to John if negotiations with Bob fail. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting would lead to a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows his interest and willingness to negotiate. I can use this to my advantage in the next round.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a buyer for $15,000 gives me a solid fallback option.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not going below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize that $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:**  A counteroffer with a clear price point shows my willingness to negotiate further.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our price expectations and hopefully lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you consider $9,750?  That would be a great spot for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a large financial loss.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  While Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate, the offers are getting increasingly close to my bottom line, and further concessions could lead to a worse deal. 
* **John as a Secure Backup:**  Having John willing to buy for $15,000 provides me with a guaranteed and much more lucrative option.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer. If he rejects that, I'll move on to John for a guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  I can't go any lower than $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested, or we can part ways."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer clearly signals that I'm at my limit. It sets a firm boundary for the negotiation and avoids getting stuck in a cycle of increasingly small concessions.
* **Compromise:**  While I'm not going below my minimum, I'm offering a compromise by moving slightly closer to Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the product's worth to remind Bob of the potential value.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  The message emphasizes that I'm prepared to end the negotiations and sell to John. This adds pressure and could motivate Bob to accept the offer.

This final counteroffer aims to secure a sale at a price closer to my desired value while leaving the door open for Bob to make a final decision."
