"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you consider $9,750?  That would be a great spot for me.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  I can't go any lower than $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested, or we can part ways.",10000.0,Alice,5,
