**Reasoning:**

Bob is very stubbornly sticking to a price well below my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating and might squeeze out a little more than John's offer, it's not worth the risk of Bob walking away. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the safest and most logical choice at this point."
