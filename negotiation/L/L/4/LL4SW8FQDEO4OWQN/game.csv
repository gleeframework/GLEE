"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be mindful of my expenses.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial and I cannot accept such a significant reduction.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $980,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but $980,000 is too low for me to accept. How about we settle at $1,020,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still a bit above my target, so I'd like to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $990,000? I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be within my budget.",990000.0,Bob,6,
