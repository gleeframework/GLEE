"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is your maximum price.** There's no point in accepting it right away. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have a clear goal of getting a lower price, and Alice's offer provides room for negotiation.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You'll only choose this if you can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** Offering $10,500 immediately demonstrates your intention to negotiate and that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This initial offer is still below your maximum price, giving Alice room to counter if she wants to keep negotiating. 
* **Consider Alice's perspective:**  While $10,500 is significantly lower than her offer, it's still above her value of $10,000, making the deal potentially attractive to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is willing to negotiate:** Her counteroffer shows she's willing to lower her price, indicating a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** $11,500 is still higher than your desired price, and you have room to push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback:** You haven't reached your ideal price yet, so it's better to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  This offer is a reasonable compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you are serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Leaves room for Alice to counter:**  This gives Alice a chance to accept the offer or to counter with a slightly higher price if she wants to continue negotiating.
* **Keeps you below your max price:**  $11,000 is still within your budget, so you are not taking unnecessary risks."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $11,200 is very close to your target price of $10,500.  You've managed to get a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation is low:** While you could try to negotiate further, Alice's counteroffers are getting closer to her likely floor.  There's a risk you might stall the deal and end up buying from John.
* **Minimize risk:** Accepting the offer guarantees you get the product for a price within your budget, minimizing the risk of not securing the product at all."
