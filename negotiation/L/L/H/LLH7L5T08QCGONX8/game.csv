"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product. Can you consider that?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $680000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $670000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",670000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to pay $660000 for the product, and that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",660000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made significant concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to make a new offer, and it's my final one. I'm offering the product to you for $665000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",665000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to pay $660000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1200000.",660000.0,Bob,10,
