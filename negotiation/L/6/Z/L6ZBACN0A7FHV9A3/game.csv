"Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,800. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. While $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,800 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about $10,500? It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
