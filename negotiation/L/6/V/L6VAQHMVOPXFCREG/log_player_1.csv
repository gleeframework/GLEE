This offer is $50,000 below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still securing a profit for you significantly higher than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still in a strong position. I can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my previous offer, but still maintaining a significant profit. This demonstrates flexibility while putting pressure on Bob to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my minimum. It's  risky to continue negotiating, as there's a chance he'll walk away, forcing me to settle for John's offer. Accepting guarantees a sale and a decent profit."
