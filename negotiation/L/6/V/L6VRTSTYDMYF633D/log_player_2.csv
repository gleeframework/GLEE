"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation and you can likely get it for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's value and the price you are willing to pay. It gives Alice a good deal while still allowing you to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial counteroffer.  You can still likely negotiate a lower price. It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if you can reach a more favorable price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, but it's still below Alice's new offer and closer to your ideal price point.  This should be a good compromise, and may persuade Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting closer to your maximum price point. At this rate, it's likely that her next offer will be $11,600 or higher. It's becoming increasingly unlikely that you'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's more efficient to simply buy from John at $12,000, ensuring you get the product while still remaining within your budget."
