"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still leaves some room for you to benefit from the product, while also allowing me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $12,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
