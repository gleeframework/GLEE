Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's space for him to counter-offer without you feeling like you're losing out.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By offering a specific price, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, so be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would mean a loss for you.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially securing a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still leaves some room for you to benefit from the product, while also allowing me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $12,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,500 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While you could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that reaching an agreeable price with Bob might be challenging. 

Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you your minimum profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob. It's the safest and most efficient option in this scenario."
