"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think!",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal!",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal quickly.",92.5,Alice,5,
