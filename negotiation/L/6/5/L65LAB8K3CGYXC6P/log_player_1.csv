"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
