"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's halfway between Alice's offer and his own valuation. This shows willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get a better price. While $11,000 is lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Rejecting and counteroffering again shows Bob is serious about getting the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing he's willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is a little higher than his previous one, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and this offer is very close to Bob's valuation of the product.  While Bob could try to get a lower price, it's getting risky.  There's a good chance Alice will reject any further counteroffers, leaving Bob with only the option of buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
