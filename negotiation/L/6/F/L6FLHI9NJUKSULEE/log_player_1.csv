Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but this is my final offer.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $925,000 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over John's offer.  It's important to secure the deal while I still have time."
