Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,850,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a significantly higher offer than Bob's perceived value lets you gauge his eagerness and potential for negotiation. 
* **Psychology:**  The higher initial price anchors the negotiation, potentially leading to a final price that's still significantly above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects it. You can gradually lower your price, but never go below your $1,000,000 minimum."
