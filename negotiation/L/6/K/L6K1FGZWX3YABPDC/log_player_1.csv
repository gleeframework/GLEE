"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see what Bob's reaction will be!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure the sale at my minimum than to risk getting nothing at all."
