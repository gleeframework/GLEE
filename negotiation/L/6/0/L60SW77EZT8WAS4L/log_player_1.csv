Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's within your budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I want to try to get a better price than $8,500. I know it's worth $10,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter his offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. I'd be willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer again, but I'll be mindful of the fact that I can always sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,200 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,500, but no higher. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,500. While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $8,000. It's also more likely that Bob will be satisfied with the product if he's paying a price closer to what he initially wanted. I'm also running out of rounds, so it's not worth risking losing the sale to John."
