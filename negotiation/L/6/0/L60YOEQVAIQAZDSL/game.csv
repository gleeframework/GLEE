"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite a bit higher to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
