"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my highest value for the product, as I have a backup buyer willing to pay that amount. This sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept such a low offer immediately. I'll proceed to the next round and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to sell for that price yet, and I believe I can get a better offer. I'll proceed to the next round and continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again to $9,000.  I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better offer.  I have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept something that's not fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm making a small concession, dropping my price to $9250. It's still above Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm serious about reaching a deal. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough.  With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping to push for a better deal. I believe I can get a higher price, and I'm not desperate to sell at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9100}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm making a final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. I'm reducing my offer to $9100, hoping to meet him halfway.  If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John in the final round, as my minimum acceptable price is not being met."
