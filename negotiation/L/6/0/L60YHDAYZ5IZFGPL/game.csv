"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the price, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $8000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $9000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10500 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still represents a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's close this deal and make it happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $9750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $10250. This represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable investment. Let's close this deal before time runs out.",10250.0,Alice,7,
