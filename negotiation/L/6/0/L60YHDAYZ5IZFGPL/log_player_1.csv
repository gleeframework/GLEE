"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by implying that the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the price, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $8000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob's initial value, it's still significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $9,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still represents a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still a significant loss compared to what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as there's still some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's close this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $9750. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my target, it's still far from what I consider the product to be worth. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I'm starting to run out of time, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $10,250. This represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable investment. Let's close this deal before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I am willing to pay $9900 for the product. This is my final offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm running out of time, and Bob's offers are not getting any closer to my desired price.  While $9,900 is a decent offer, it's still not enough for me.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $15,000."
