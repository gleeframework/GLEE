"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. I understand its worth to you is around $800,000, but I'm offering it to you for $900,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the long-term benefits. If this isn't the right price for you, I have another buyer who is eager to purchase it for $1,000,000. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
