"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. Considering your offer of $10,000, I can meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is the last price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $11,000 is still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a way to make this work. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're at an impasse, Bob. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free consultation to sweeten the deal. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting.",13000.0,Alice,9,
