"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far too high for his budget. He should attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. Considering your offer of $10,000, I can meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He should keep trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is the last price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget. While he's getting closer, he should continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $11,000 is still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, $13,000 is still too high. He should keep pushing for a lower price.  He's almost halfway through his negotiation rounds, so it's important to get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a way to make this work. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're at an impasse, Bob. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free consultation to sweeten the deal. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob is running out of time, and Alice's offer is still too high. He should buy the product from John for $8,000, even though he'd prefer a slightly better deal. The additional warranty and consultation offered by Alice aren't worth the extra $5,000 to Bob."
