"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging to build rapport. 
* **Open ended:** The message leaves room for Bob to ask questions or make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

*  I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and understand his potential value for the product.  
* If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my price in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffers. 
* The option to sell to John at $120 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell at this point.  
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob's initial interest suggests he might be willing to pay more.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next steps:** I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but not settling for Bob's initial offer. 
* **Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us, highlighting mutual benefit.
* **Room for negotiation:**  $135 leaves room for further negotiation in the next round if needed.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While still above my minimum, this counteroffer minimizes the risk of losing the deal completely. 
* **Preparing for the next round:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy for round 4."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited time:**  We are approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. 
* **Potential for better deal:** It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds. 

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price just slightly below my minimum.
* **Balancing potential and certainty:** While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high at this point. 
* **Moving on:**  I'm comfortable with the outcome and can focus on other opportunities."
