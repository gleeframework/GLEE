{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its true value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters. However, I'm not asking for too much, as I want to avoid him rejecting the offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not able to go that high right now.  My budget for this product is $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to work with you, I need to be a bit closer to my asking price to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $825,000?  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
``` 
I'm offering a price that is still slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope this will convince Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $812,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $812,500 is a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
