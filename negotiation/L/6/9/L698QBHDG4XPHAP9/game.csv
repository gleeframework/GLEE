"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,750,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,520,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1520000.0,Bob,4,
