"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of significant value. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to ensure it reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both parties.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it close, but I'm seeing we both want this deal to happen. I'm willing to drop to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",925000.0,Bob,6,
