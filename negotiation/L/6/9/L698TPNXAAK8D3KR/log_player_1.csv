Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to ensure it reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial lowball. We're still in early rounds, and I'm aiming for a price closer to $1.1 million. Rejecting now keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a figure closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it close, but I'm seeing we both want this deal to happen. I'm willing to drop to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($50,000 instead of $75,000) to signal I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""final offer,"" I introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to take this offer seriously.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price while emphasizing my willingness to close the deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is not significantly increasing his offers, and he's still substantially below my $1,000,000 baseline. It's unlikely he'll reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a worse deal from Bob."
