"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,350,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping to receive.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still gives you a great deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
