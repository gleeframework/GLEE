Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my ideal but still leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob can make him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A $50,000 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value allows for a back-and-forth. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy relies on Bob's desire to buy the product. If he's not truly interested, he might reject even this offer. It's important to observe his reactions and be prepared to adjust my approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer is lower than my desired price, but it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, and I can potentially push for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Avoiding a Quick Sale:** Selling to John immediately would guarantee a sale but lock in a lower profit.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to potentially maximize my earnings.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, attempting to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price.  I will need to gauge his willingness to negotiate and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,350,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping to receive.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still gives you a great deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer meets Bob halfway, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Focusing on Compromise:** The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, making it less about my need and more about finding common ground.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm not giving in completely, but I'm showing a willingness to negotiate. This keeps the pressure on Bob to either accept or come up with a counteroffer closer to my target."
