Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit significantly above my minimum acceptable price. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than half of my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This is still a significant profit for me and is closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more appealing. I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly less than what I can get from John. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I meet my minimum acceptable price."
