"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $850,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would still allow you to make a significant profit, and it's the closest I can come to your price.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I am still unable to meet your current offer at $875,000. I am now willing to consider offers up to $860,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,
