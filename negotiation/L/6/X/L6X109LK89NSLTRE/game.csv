"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price we can both agree on. I'm confident this product will be valuable to you. Let's start with a price of $1500000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $800000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  While $800000 is lower than my initial expectation, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1150000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find a price that works for both of us.  $900000 is still a little lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $950000, but this is my final offer.  If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
