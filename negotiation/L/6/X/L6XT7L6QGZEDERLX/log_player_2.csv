"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance to negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?"", 
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm aiming to save as much as possible, I don't want to lowball Alice initially. This could offend her and make negotiation difficult.
* **Targeting Above Alice's Value:** I'm aiming slightly above Alice's perceived value ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate down. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm trying to establish a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. How about we meet at $9,200? It's a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Moving:** Alice lowered her price from $9,500 to $9,200, which indicates she's open to negotiation.
* **Room for Improvement:** There's still a significant gap between her offer ($9,200) and both her value ($8,000) and my outside option ($10,000). I believe I can negotiate further. 
* **Not Desperate Yet:**  I'm not in a rush and haven't reached a point where John's offer is more appealing.  I'll continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $9,200 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $8,900?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 8900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:** I'm making smaller concessions now ($300 instead of $450) to signal that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm holding my ground below $9,000 to keep the pressure on Alice to move closer to her value.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I'm continuing to emphasize finding a mutually beneficial solution, maintaining a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,900. How about we try $8,950? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain from Further Negotiation:** Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $9,000. While I might be able to push for $8,900, the potential savings are minimal and not worth the risk of her walking away. 
* **Good Deal Secured:** $8,950 is a significant savings compared to my outside option of $10,000 from John. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate indefinitely has diminishing returns. Accepting now saves time and concludes the deal."
