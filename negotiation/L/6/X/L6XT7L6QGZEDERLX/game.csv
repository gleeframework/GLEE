"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. How about we meet at $9,200? It's a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $9,200 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $8,900?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,900. How about we try $8,950? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.",8950.0,Alice,5,
