"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit surprised by the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's find a middle ground - how about $850,000? This reflects the product's significant value while still offering you a strong deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,4,
