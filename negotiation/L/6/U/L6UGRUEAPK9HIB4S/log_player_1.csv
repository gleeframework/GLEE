"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to gauge his interest and leave room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum of $120 as possible, while still leaving room to potentially compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm trying to split the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still not willing to sell the product for below $110.  I'm hoping I can convince Bob to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to drop the price to $108. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer to Bob, lowering my price to $108. This is a compromise from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. By emphasizing this is my final offer, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision while leaving a slight opening for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $108. Would you consider $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $106 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not willing to sell the product below my minimum of $110. There are only a few rounds left, and I still hope to get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can convince Bob to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $106 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $107, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 107} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $107, which is still above my minimum acceptable price. This is a small compromise, but it shows Bob that I'm still willing to negotiate.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $105 again. It's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum price of $110.  It's becoming clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  To avoid losing even more time and potentially getting a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum."
