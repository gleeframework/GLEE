Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a price exceeding John's guaranteed offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" attempts to justify the high price, even if those benefits aren't explicitly stated in the prompt. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and encourages a response, signaling willingness to negotiate. This is important as Bob can outright reject the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** We don't know how likely Bob is to walk away from a high price. A more aggressive offer risks losing him to John's guaranteed $800,000.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This offer assumes Alice is prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. She needs a strategy for potentially lowering the price while still aiming higher than $800,000."
