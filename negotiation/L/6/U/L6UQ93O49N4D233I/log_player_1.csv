Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is at least $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a bit above market value, but I have to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,500? This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $15,250? That's a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

I'm running out of rounds and Bob's offers are getting too low.  It's better to sell to John now for $15,000 and avoid risking a lower price."
