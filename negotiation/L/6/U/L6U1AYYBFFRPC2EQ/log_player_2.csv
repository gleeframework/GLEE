You can do better than $100.  You should counteroffer Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

You're still better off going with John at $80.  You can try to counteroffer Alice again, but there's a risk she'll refuse and you'll have to buy from John anyway."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going all the way down to $85. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $92 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

At this point, Alice is only willing to go down to $92, which is still more than what John is offering.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
