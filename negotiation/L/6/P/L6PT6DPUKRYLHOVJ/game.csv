"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $2000000 for it. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product's potential will far exceed that price.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
