Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me right now. I see the value in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $900,000? This is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while respecting my budget. What do you say?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price.

This is a more significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
