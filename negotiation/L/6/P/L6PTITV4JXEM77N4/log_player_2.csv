Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me right now. I see the value in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we consider a price closer to $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $900,000? This is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can work something out.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we discuss a price of $950,000? This is a more significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original price. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
