Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, knowing the product is worth $150 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a $30 gap between my asking price and Bob's perceived value. This allows for potential counteroffers and a win-win scenario.
* **Protecting My Minimum:** My minimum value for the product is $80. I'm not willing to go lower than that.  

I'll be ready to negotiate based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  I think that's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my absolute minimum of $80. I cannot accept this offer.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a compromise. 

I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** My counteroffer of $90 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $100 and my minimum of $80.
* **Explaining My Reasoning:** I've explained my reasoning for the price, highlighting the value of the product and the potential profit for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider my offer.

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob and lead to a successful sale."
