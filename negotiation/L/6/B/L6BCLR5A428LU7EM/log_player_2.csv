"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer of $140 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You know you can get it for $150 from John, so you should try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but  $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Polite and interested:** Starting with a polite message keeps the negotiation friendly.  
* **Anchoring low:** By offering $110, we're anchoring the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's starting point. This leaves room for us to potentially meet in the middle while still staying well below our $150 maximum.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $130, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** Alice lowered her price to $130, which is a $20 saving from John's price and only $10 more than our initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away.  $130 is a solid price, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
