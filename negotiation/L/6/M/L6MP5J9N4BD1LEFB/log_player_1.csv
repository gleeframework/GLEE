"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down slightly, but I won't go below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. If he's not willing to budge, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial price but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  How about $1,100,000? This gives us both some room for profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum target of $1,000,000 and would secure me a decent profit.  While I'd like to push for more, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle with John's offer.  It's better to take a slightly lower price and secure the sale."
