"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that price point. I could consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers substantial returns, which is why I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects a fairer deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I appreciate the value proposition, I need a price that makes sense for my budget.  I could go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,
