"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate but $1,000,000 is too low considering the value this product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while still recognizing the true worth of this asset.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  To make this work for me, I would need to be closer to $1,100,000. How about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer to a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
