"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Considering its value and your interest, I propose we make this deal even more enticing. How about if you purchase it for $140? This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a price that's still a significant savings compared to its market value of $150. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
