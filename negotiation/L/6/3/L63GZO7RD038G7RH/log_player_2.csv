"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. 
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting my budget and acknowledging her value assessment.
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's settle on this and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is my final offer, representing my absolute maximum budget.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm highlighting the compromise involved in meeting her halfway.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing that both of us would be satisfied with this deal."
