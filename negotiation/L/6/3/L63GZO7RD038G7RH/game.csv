"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's settle on this and finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
