# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  You should try to counteroffer again and see if you can get closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $9,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, which is $10,750. I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

While $10,750 is closer to your goal, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's possible that Alice is willing to budge a little more, and you don't want to miss the opportunity to save more money."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $11,000? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice has clearly set a firm price of $11,000.  You've already made several counteroffers and it's unlikely she'll budge further.  To avoid potentially going back and forth for much longer, you should buy the product from John for $8,000. It's the best deal you can get right now, and saves you from further negotiation and possible frustration."
