"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value you've expressed and allows for some room for us both to agree.  Let me know your thoughts!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $9,500.  I think this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value you see in the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $8,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $9,150. That's a significant compromise on my part, and it would leave us both feeling good about the deal.  Let's make this happen, how about it?",9150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $9,150 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer: $8,750. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you think about it?",8750.0,Bob,8,
