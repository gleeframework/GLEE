{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. I'm also inviting him to participate in the negotiation. 

This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a constructive dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Even though I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to compromise that much in the first round.  I will counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value you've expressed and allows for some room for us both to agree.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $9,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains some value for myself.
* **Message:** I'm reinforcing the value Bob sees in the product and emphasizing that this counteroffer is a good compromise. I'm also keeping the tone friendly and inviting further dialogue. 

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price point while still demonstrating flexibility and encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell at that price this early in the negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $9,500.  I think this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value you see in the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows a willingness to meet him halfway but also leaves some room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget and framing my offer as a fair compromise. I'm also subtly reminding him of the value of the product to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties while leaving open the possibility for a final agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $8,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.  

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of finding a price closer to my desired price.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $9,150. That's a significant compromise on my part, and it would leave us both feeling good about the deal.  Let's make this happen, how about it?"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,150, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's latest offer of $8,800.  This shows a clear willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's concerns and framing this as a final, ""good faith"" offer to incentivize him to accept. The message is friendly and emphasizes the positive outcome for both of us.

This counteroffer is designed to put pressure on Bob to accept. The offer is fair and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement, while reminding him that I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $9,150 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer: $8,750. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you think about it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise further and risk losing a significant amount of money.  

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell to him.  This ensures I get the best possible price and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob."
