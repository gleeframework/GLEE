"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $1,300,000? This is a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $1,275,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to secure a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
