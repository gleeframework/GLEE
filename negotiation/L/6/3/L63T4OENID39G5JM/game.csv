"Alice, I appreciate your latest offer, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd like to revisit the price and also discuss the terms of the sale. I'm thinking $875,000 is a fair price, but I'd like to propose a 30-day payment plan with a 5% discount for paying upfront. Additionally, I'd like to negotiate the inclusion of some additional support and maintenance services. What are your thoughts?",875000.0,Bob,6,
