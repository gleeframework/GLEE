"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about we try $775,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
