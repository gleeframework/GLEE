"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point.  It's above your minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob thinking about the value he'll get.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is tempting, it's still below the product's worth to Bob, and we've got 8 rounds to work with.  Let's see if we can get closer to that $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $95.  This still leaves you with a good deal, and gets us closer to a final agreement.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer!  While $90 is a good offer, it's still less than what the product is worth to Bob. We've got a few rounds left, so let's see if we can inch our way up to a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  How about $92?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to come out with a win.  Let's try to reach a final agreement in these next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $91 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We're down to the wire!  While we haven't reached our initial asking price, $91 is a good deal, and it's close to Bob's perceived value.  It's time to close this deal and take the profit."
