"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $13,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  Let's split the difference. How about $13,250?  That way we both get a little closer to our preferred prices. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so how about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
