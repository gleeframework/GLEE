"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.  My initial price is $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message makes Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning that it's a ""great deal"" for Bob can encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly states that you are open to negotiating, which sets the stage for a potential counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer of $12,000 provides a backup in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** Highlighting that the price is a ""significant reduction"" suggests I'm making an effort to reach a deal.
* **Urgency:**  Using ""let's close this deal"" adds a subtle pressure to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000, which is the price I was initially quoted by another seller. Can you meet me in the middle at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $12,000 I need to meet my own value.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob seems willing to budge, and I can likely get him to go higher.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** Having the option to sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* at $9,125. This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product and allows us both to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  By suggesting meeting halfway, I'm emphasizing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my desired value.
* **Fairness and Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and framing the price as ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the Deal:** The phrase ""allows us both to close the deal"" subtly adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,125. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500, and I'm willing to pay that price. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's message suggests he's not willing to budge much further.
* **John's Offer is a better deal:**  I've reached a point where I'm likely not going to get a better price from Bob, and John's offer of $12,000 guarantees me my minimum value.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiations."
