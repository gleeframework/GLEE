"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $8,500. Would you be open to that?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  Honestly, though, $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  My absolute best offer is $8,700. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I think I'll need to consider other options.",8700.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,700. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm offering the product to you for $9,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,7,
