Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob a decent margin for negotiation while still leaving me with a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident I can get a better deal than John's offer, but I'm willing to walk away if Bob proves unwilling to negotiate reasonably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that's significantly better than my minimum.  I believe this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and only slightly less than my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's more profitable than selling to John and likely the best deal I can get at this point."
