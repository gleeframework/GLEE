"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to start by rejecting Alice's offer and see if you can get a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Offering $75 is a significant reduction from $100, showing Alice you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price is still within your budget and leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to your target.
* **Positive tone:**  The message emphasizes your interest in the product while also expressing your willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than $100, it's still above your target price of $100. You have multiple rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially lower the price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $80, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** We're moving closer to your target price of $100, but we're still trying to save as much as possible.
* **Compromise:** $80 is a reasonable compromise that shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway, but you're still holding firm on your budget.
* **Positive and assertive:** The message emphasizes your interest in closing the deal while remaining confident about the price."
