"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I would like to propose a lower price of $8,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with what I believe the product is worth to me. I hope you can consider this proposal.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I would like to stick to my original assessment of the product's value to me. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price closer to $7,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
