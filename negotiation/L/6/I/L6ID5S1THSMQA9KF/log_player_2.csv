"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to make a deal with you, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly not budging from her valuation of $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum you're willing to pay. Since John offers the product at the same price without any negotiation needed, it makes more sense to buy from John directly."
