"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so anything less than that is a good deal.
* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum value of $1,000,000.
* It gives Alice some room to negotiate while still giving you a decent price. 
* It's a good starting point for a counteroffer, and allows you to see if Alice is willing to move closer to your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $1,120,000 is still better than John's price of $1,200,000.
* There's not much room to negotiate further, as Alice has already moved a bit closer to your initial counteroffer. 
* Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product at a good price and avoid further negotiation."
