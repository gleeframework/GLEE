Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant amount for me.  I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a considerable investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant investment for me and a good compromise.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he will reach a price point that satisfies my minimum requirement in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees the desired profit."
