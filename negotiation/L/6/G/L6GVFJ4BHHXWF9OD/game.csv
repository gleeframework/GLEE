"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant amount for me.  I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To move this forward, I can offer the product for $1,050,000. This reflects a substantial reduction on my part, demonstrating my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a considerable investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the true value of the product. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant investment for me and a good compromise.  Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,6,
