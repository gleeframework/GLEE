"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start counter-negotiating and hopefully bring the price down closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant amount for me.  I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To move this forward, I can offer the product for $1,050,000. This reflects a substantial reduction on my part, demonstrating my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high for Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and attempt to get the price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a considerable investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the true value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  However, Bob is getting closer to his target, and rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation in hopes of getting a lower price.  There are still 5 rounds left, so Bob has time to see if he can further decrease the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant investment for me and a good compromise.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
