""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $120, given its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($150) than it is to us ($80).
* **Our Bottom Line:** We have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John. 
* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product at $120 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $80 = $70) while still being significantly attractive to Bob. This maximizes our potential profit while still making it likely Bob will accept."
