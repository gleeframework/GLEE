"Bob, I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price.
