"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $115?  I'm getting close to my limit, so hopefully we can reach a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
