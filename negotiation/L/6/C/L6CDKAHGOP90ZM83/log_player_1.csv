Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds immense value for you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This high price allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much larger profit.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. You can always lower the price, but you can't go higher once an offer is made. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy. If Bob is put off by the high price and refuses to negotiate, you'll have to settle for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
