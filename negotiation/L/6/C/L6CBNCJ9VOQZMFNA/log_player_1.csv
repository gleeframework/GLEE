Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and closer to his own valuation than mine.  It's time to bring John into the picture.
