"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $11,000 to be comfortable. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
