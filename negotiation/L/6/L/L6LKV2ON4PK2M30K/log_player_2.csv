"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $10,000.  While $10,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Bob can continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $11,000 to be comfortable. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is firm on her price of $10,750. This is only $250 less than John's price, and the risk of further negotiation is high. It's better for Bob to avoid the risk and buy the product from John for $12,000.  He's still within his budget, and he can avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
