"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Please consider my offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims the product is worth $1,000,000 to both of you, her offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for $1,000,000, saving $50,000."
