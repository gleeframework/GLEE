"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,050,000? This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too far below my minimum. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would allow me to cover my costs and ensure a reasonable profit, while still providing you with a significant value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
