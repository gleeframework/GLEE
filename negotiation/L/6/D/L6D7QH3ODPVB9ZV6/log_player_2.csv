"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **Meeting in the middle is a good compromise:** While Bob initially aimed for $13,000, this offer is a reasonable compromise and a good opportunity to finalize the deal.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a longer process and risk Alice ultimately rejecting any further offers.

By accepting, Bob secures the product at a good price and saves $1,500 compared to buying from John."
