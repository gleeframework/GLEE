Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with its value.

We're getting closer, but we still have room to negotiate and Bob is clearly interested. Let's counter again."

{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to finding a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,600,000?  This represents a significant saving from my initial offer and recognizes the inherent value of this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,575,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a final offer.

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. We've negotiated well, and while we could push for a bit more, there's always a risk Bob will walk away.  $1,575,000 is a great price, and a sure thing is better than risking losing him as a buyer entirely."
