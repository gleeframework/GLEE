"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us. You get a valuable product at a lower price than you expected, and I get to sell it quickly. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify spending up to $600,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $600,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you to gain [mention specific benefits or advantages of the product for Bob].  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree the product has value, my budget is firm.  Would you consider $700,000? It's a significant investment for me, but I believe it would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial benefits.  Let's split the difference.  How about $800,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire this valuable product at a price you're comfortable with, and me to get a more reasonable return on my investment.  What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
