"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  You can try to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of your budget. This shows you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what you can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

This offer is your final price.  It's the price you're willing to pay, and it's also the price you can get from John. If Alice rejects this offer, you'll buy from John."
