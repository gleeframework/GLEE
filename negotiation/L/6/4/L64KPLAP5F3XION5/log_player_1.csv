"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,900,000 for this round only. This is a limited-time opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high in the first round to establish a strong anchor point and test Bob's willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time opportunity,"" I'm trying to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially reduce the number of negotiation rounds.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more assertive in my initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my valuation. My counteroffer for the product is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant amount, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I started high, and he countered reasonably, but I'm not willing to drop to his price so quickly.  I'll make a strategic counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the inherent value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth and potential of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer with a $200,000 decrease, signaling my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a strong position above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I continue to reinforce the product's value to justify the high price and encourage Bob to see the value in meeting closer to my offer. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're getting closer to my fallback option of selling to John. While I'm not ready to do that yet, each round increases the appeal of a sure thing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your proposal some thought, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'd like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which shows he's serious. However, $1,600,000 is still significantly lower than my initial ask. At this stage, I'm willing to hold firm and counter, aiming to secure a deal closer to $1,650,000. I believe there's still some room to negotiate before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's aim to finalize this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,675,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering the product's unique value and potential."",
""product_price"": 1675000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($25,000) to signal that I'm getting closer to my bottom line. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing a price with the aim to ""finalize,"" I'm subtly introducing time pressure to encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Justification:** I continue to reiterate the product's value to justify the high price. 
* **Calculated Risk:** While I'm getting closer to my fallback, I believe there's still a good chance to secure a price above $1,600,000 with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my assessment, I would like to counter with a price of $1,650,000. I hope this aligns better with our goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my target price. While I might have been able to push for a slightly higher amount, accepting this offer now guarantees a substantial profit ($650,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of the deal falling through in further rounds.  It's always good to end a negotiation on a positive note with a mutually agreeable outcome."
