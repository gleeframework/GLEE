"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $140. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $135, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $135, Bob. I think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $135, which would be $137.50. Can you consider that?",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $135, but I'd rather not go above that. Can you meet me at $135?",135.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $138. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",138.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm afraid $138 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $100 if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,10,
