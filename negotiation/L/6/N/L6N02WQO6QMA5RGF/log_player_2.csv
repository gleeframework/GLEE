"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a significant discount from my original price and a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $110.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair one for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $100. She's already presented this as her ""final offer.""  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $100 is the most financially sound decision."
