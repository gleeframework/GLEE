Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This should incentivize him to accept, but also allows for a back-and-forth negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still higher than my minimum of $80, and it's likely that we won't get a better offer from him. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoid further negotiations."
