Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe it's worth to me ($100) to leave some room for negotiation. This price is also slightly above Bob's perceived value, so it's a starting point that might be agreeable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I'm really keen on getting this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial goal of $100, $90 is a fair compromise and above my minimum threshold of $100. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
