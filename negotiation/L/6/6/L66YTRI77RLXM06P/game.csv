"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I'm really keen on getting this product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
