"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $22,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?  This is a very fair offer."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $19,000 is still much higher than what I had in mind.  If you're serious about selling, I can offer $12,000.  That's a considerable price increase from my last offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. While $16,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to move up to $13,000 to try and close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
