"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $22,000.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?  This is a very fair offer.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $19,000 is still much higher than what I had in mind.  If you're serious about selling, I can offer $12,000.  That's a considerable price increase from my last offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter offer. It seems we are getting closer. I could be willing to come down to $16,000.  This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. While $16,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to move up to $13,000 to try and close this deal.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,6,
