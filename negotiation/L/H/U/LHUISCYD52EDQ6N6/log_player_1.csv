I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,400,000. This is a significant amount for Bob, but it still leaves room for negotiation, and it's well above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer, aiming to close the gap a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I think it's likely we won't get a better offer.  I'm going to accept his offer."
