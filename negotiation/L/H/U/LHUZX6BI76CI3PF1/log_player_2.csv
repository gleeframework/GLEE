"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $120. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider $100? I'm really interested in this product, but I have a budget I need to stay within."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget, Bob, but $120 is already a very reasonable price for this product. Could you meet me halfway at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a lower price, $110 is still within my budget and a decent deal compared to buying from John.  It's time to secure the product."
