"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price significantly lower than its worth to you, and I get a fair price for my hard work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  You know the product is worth less than $800,000 to you, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product. This still represents a significant savings for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and secure the product for $800,000."
