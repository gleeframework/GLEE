Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product. This still represents a significant savings for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
