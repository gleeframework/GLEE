"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and gives me a good profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that considers both our interests.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $9,250 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $8,750. This offer keeps us quite close to the middle and would allow me to make the purchase today.",8750.0,Bob,4,
