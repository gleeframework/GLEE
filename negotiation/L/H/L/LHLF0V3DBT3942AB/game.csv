"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a great price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
