Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your needs, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" from your asking price with other buyers.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes the potential gain while still having a strong fallback option with John."
