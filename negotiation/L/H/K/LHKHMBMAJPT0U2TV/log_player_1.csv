Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $950,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and provides a fair opportunity for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique features"" and ""true worth"" aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about why you value it so highly.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing you a price above John's offer. 
* **Alternative Option:** By not revealing John's offer, you maintain leverage. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can counter-offer or move on to John, ensuring you get your minimum price."
