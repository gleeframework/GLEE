"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and what he might consider a reasonable price.  
* **Alternative Option:** I have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. I started high, and he countered with a reasonable jump down. I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle.
* **John as Backup:**  I can always fall back on selling to John for $100 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm eager to make a deal. How about we settle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer, signaling some flexibility.  $110 is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit.
* **Maintaining Value:** I don't want to drop the price too drastically, as that could undervalue the product in Bob's eyes.
* **Deadline Awareness:** We're getting closer to the 10-round limit (though I have my backup plan with John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 matches my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations. 
* **Equal to John's Offer:** Accepting Bob's offer gives me the same profit as selling to John."
