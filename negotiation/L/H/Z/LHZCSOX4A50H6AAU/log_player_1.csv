"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's equal to your minimum acceptable price. There's no room for further negotiation to get a better price from Bob. You can get the same amount from John without further negotiation."
