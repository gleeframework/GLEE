"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price I'm asking. Would you like to purchase it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. I hope this is within your budget.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and agree on $87.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I propose a price of $89 for the product. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being competitive with your offer.",89.0,Alice,5,
