"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You know Alice values the product at a lower price, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000) while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now getting closer to her value for the product. However, there's still room for negotiation. You can try pushing a bit further down before considering accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $8,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counteroffer offers Alice her perceived value of the product. While there's a chance she might still counter, it's a strong position to take. If she rejects this, you can always accept her previous offer of $8,500 or go with John's offer."
