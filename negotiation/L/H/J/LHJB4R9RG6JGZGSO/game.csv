"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, which I appreciate.  I'm still a bit away from that price.  Would you be willing to go up to $145? That would be a fair price for both of us and we could close this deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  I'm still a bit too high at $145.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,6,
