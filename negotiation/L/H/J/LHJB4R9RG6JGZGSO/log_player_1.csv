"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you'd love. I'm thinking $175 would be a fair price, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed.  I want to avoid going too low too quickly and risk losing out on potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my acceptable price. I'll reject it and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, which I appreciate.  I'm still a bit away from that price.  Would you be willing to go up to $145? That would be a fair price for both of us and we could close this deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his last offer while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  I want to show flexibility while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  I'm still a bit too high at $145.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $135, and with only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned about potentially losing the sale altogether.  It's risky to continue to negotiate, as I might end up with a lower price or have to sell to John, which wouldn't be ideal.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
