"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something unique and valuable, and I'm confident it could be a great asset for you.  I'm asking $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob. 
* Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is too high. 
* It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  $10,000 is a bit out of my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum value ($8,000) as possible.
* This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a lower price, giving Alice room to negotiate. 
* This is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, which is likely to make her consider counter-offering, rather than immediately rejecting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value this product offers.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has reduced her price from $10,000 to $9,000. 
* Bob is still willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. 
* There is still room to negotiate further, making it worthwhile to reject Alice's offer and try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate that.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $8,000. Would you be willing to accept that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is getting closer to his maximum price.
* This counteroffer is a smaller reduction than the previous one, showing that Bob is serious about closing the deal at this price. 
* It's important to be firm with the counteroffer but still convey a willingness to negotiate further."
