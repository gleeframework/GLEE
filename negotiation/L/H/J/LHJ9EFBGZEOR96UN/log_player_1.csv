"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something unique and valuable, and I'm confident it could be a great asset for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high price ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential benefit to Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation and share his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  $10000 is a bit out of my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed option, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob in the hope of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value this product offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but not by too much.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential benefits and emphasizing that $9,000 is still a good deal.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  $9,000 leaves room for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate that.  However, $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $8000. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting minimum price:** Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob backing out completely, especially since he's already stated his budget is firm.
* **Guaranteed sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, securing the minimum value I'm willing to accept."
