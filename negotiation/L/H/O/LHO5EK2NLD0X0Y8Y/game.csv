"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer of $800,000 is lower than what I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm confident this product can deliver significant value for your business.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm proposing $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can see the value in the product, but $1,250,000 is still a stretch for me.  Would you consider $950,000?  That's a significant investment on my part, but I believe it could be worthwhile if we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm convinced this product can generate significant value for your business, and I want to make sure we reach an agreement that works for both of us.  However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value while allowing for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
