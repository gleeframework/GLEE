{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to be truly transformative for your business. My asking price is $1,750,000. This reflects the significant value and potential I see in it. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and leaves me more wiggle room.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using positive language to frame the offer as an opportunity for Bob, emphasizing the potential benefits.
* **Focus on value:** I'm not just stating a price, but highlighting the product's value and potential to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** The initial price sets a high baseline.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  It allows for a back-and-forth conversation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not giving away the farm, ensuring I still profit.

I'm prepared to counter Bob's offers or walk away if needed, as I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** His offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While his offer is unacceptable, I'm not ready to give up on a deal with Bob. There's potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Leverage John:**  I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the confidence to reject Bob's initial counteroffer and push for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price that's still attractive to him but more aligned with my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By rejecting Bob's low offer, I maintain the opportunity to secure a higher price.
* **Maintain control:**  Counteroffering demonstrates I'm not desperate for a deal, and I'm willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Explore potential:**  Negotiating with Bob allows me to see if we can find common ground and potentially achieve a mutually beneficial agreement."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can see the value in the product, but $1,250,000 is still a stretch for me.  Would you consider $950,000?  That's a significant investment on my part, but I believe it could be worthwhile if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining leverage:** I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my desired price. This gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. His increasing offers suggest he's serious about acquiring the product, and I believe I can push for a more favorable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price that reflects the value of the product while remaining open to finding a mutually agreeable solution. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to secure a higher price.
* **Maintain control:**  Counteroffering demonstrates I'm not desperate for a deal and I'm willing to walk away if necessary.
