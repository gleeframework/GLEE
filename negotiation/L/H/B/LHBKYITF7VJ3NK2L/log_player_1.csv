Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being a significant discount from your initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your initial offer was $1,400,000 and your new offer is $1,325,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,312,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,312,500

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly very interested and using a consistent tactic. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your offer still undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground: I propose $1,300,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I think we're getting close. I'll offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has now presented his ""final offer.""  Accepting this offer secures a profit of $275,000, which is a significant return. Continuing the negotiation poses the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away, leaving us with the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
