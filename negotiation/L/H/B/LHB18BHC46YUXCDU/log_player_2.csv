# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price you'd pay John ($1,100,000 vs. $1,500,000).  This means you save $400,000 by accepting Alice's offer, even if you don't know the true value of the product to her.  Saving money is always beneficial in this scenario."
