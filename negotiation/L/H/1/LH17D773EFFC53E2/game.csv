"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant amount for me. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value of the product to me and my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a good compromise that ensures both of us get a fair deal.  Let's finalize this agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a significant amount for me and a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
