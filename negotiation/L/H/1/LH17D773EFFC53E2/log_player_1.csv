"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000). I have 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a better price with Bob. Selling to John at this point would leave me with a lower profit than I might be able to achieve with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant amount for me. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value of the product to me and my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob as I have more rounds left.  Selling to John would secure me a guaranteed profit, but I'm hoping to potentially get a higher price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a good compromise that ensures both of us get a fair deal.  Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a significant amount for me and a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below $1,500,000.  At this point, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating with Bob. If I continue, there's a chance he will continue to offer amounts below my minimum, potentially leading to a lower final price. It's more prudent to sell to John, guaranteeing a profit of $1,500,000, which meets my minimum requirement."
