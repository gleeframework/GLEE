Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you get more than your minimum $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob the incentive to accept. 
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows confidence and sets a high baseline for negotiations.

Remember, you can always adjust your offers based on Bob's responses. If he rejects your offer, you can analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a viable option, but you can potentially get more by continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still leaves you a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve a more suitable return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-point compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It signals your willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain profit:** $1,250,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** You remind Bob that this price still offers him a significant profit. 

By offering a counteroffer, you show that you are open to negotiations and willing to work with Bob to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While $1,150,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still worth trying to push for a slightly higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  You can still potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer and continuing negotiations.
* **Risk of losing to John:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would guarantee a sale, but you have the potential to earn more by continuing with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage and show that you're not willing to settle for his last offer. This could potentially encourage Bob to raise his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,200,000? This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a final compromise,  meeting halfway between your previous offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,150,000). 
* **Strong Incentive:** The $1,200,000 price offers Bob a good deal, as it's still below his perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **Close to your goal:** While not your ideal price, this offer is significantly closer to your target than John's offer and still achieves a respectable profit. 

By presenting a final compromise, you show your willingness to reach an agreement while ensuring you receive a fair price for your product."
