"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering Alice.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, you still have room to negotiate lower, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it signals my serious intention to negotiate a lower price. I'm hoping to push Alice towards a compromise that is still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good price and much better than John's offer.  It's likely that further negotiation will take time and may not result in a significantly better price. Accepting Alice's offer is the most efficient way to secure the product at a reasonable cost."
