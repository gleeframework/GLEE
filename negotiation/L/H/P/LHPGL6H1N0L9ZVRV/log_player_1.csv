"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115, which would be $112.50. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $112.5 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $112.50 is still too far below what I need.  Would you be willing to go up to $114? That's just a small increase, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 114}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but $114 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.50 and $114, which would be $113.25. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $113.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $113.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, the negotiation is getting tedious and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.  To avoid wasting more time and ensure I get my minimum price, I'll sell to John for $150."
