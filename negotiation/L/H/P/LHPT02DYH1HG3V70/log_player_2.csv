"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, but ideally wants to pay less.
* **Alice's offer is too high:** $12,000 is still above Alice's value of $10,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer potential:** By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer closer to his ideal price.

By rejecting, Bob keeps the negotiation going and has a better chance of getting a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's original counteroffer. Bob should reject it and try to negotiate further:

* **Bob's goal is to save money:** He's still aiming to get the product for less than $12,000.
* **Alice's offer is not favorable:** $12,500 is too high, especially as she rejected a lower offer from Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price, or at least maintain the current offer of $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise, but still staying below Alice's current offer. 

This counteroffer could potentially lead to a deal, or at least keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice keeps raising the price.  At this point, Bob is better off buying from John.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $13,000 is significantly higher than Bob's ideal price and getting closer to John's price.
* **Negotiation is getting unproductive:** Alice is clearly not willing to budge much, and further negotiation could drag on. 
* **Time is a factor:** Bob's goal is to get the product, and continuing with Alice risks him not securing it at all.

It's more efficient and likely to achieve Bob's goal to buy from John at $15,000."
