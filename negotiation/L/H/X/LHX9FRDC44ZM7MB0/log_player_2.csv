"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a better price than $150 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  I'm looking to spend closer to $100 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the product for $100, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is good:** $110 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $150. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of going higher:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice will counter with a higher price, potentially pushing Bob closer to his limit. 
* **Value is there:** The product is worth $80 to Alice, so Bob is still getting a good deal even at $110."
