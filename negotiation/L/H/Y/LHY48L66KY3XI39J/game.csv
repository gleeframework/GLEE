"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $13,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. I'm prepared to offer $12,750. This represents a significant saving for you and still allows me to get the product at a reasonable price. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $13,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",13250.0,Alice,5,
