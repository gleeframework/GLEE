"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply.  I understand your initial offer, but $6,000 is considerably below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This offer reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  I can do $7,000.  That's a fair offer, considering I could always buy it elsewhere for a bit less. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to make another adjustment to find a solution. How about we meet halfway at $9,500? This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower.  Would you consider $8,000? That's my final offer - it's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're happy with it.",8000.0,Bob,6,
