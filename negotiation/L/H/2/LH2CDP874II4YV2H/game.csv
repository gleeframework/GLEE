"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product offers.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product sits significantly higher.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I still think $900,000 is a reasonable offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
