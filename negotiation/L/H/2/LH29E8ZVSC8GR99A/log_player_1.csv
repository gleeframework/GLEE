Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal! What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  We start by aiming slightly below the maximum Bob is willing to pay ($150) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The slightly higher price leaves room for Bob to negotiate or feel like he's getting a better deal if he's inclined to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, ensuring we don't lose out."
