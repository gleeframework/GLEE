"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering what you could gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance of getting a better price. Alice is clearly aiming for a profit margin, so there might be room for negotiation."
