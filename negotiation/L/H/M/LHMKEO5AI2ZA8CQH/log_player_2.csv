Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $88. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we try $82? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will go below $82 at this point, and it's better to secure the product from John at $80 than risk the negotiation failing."
