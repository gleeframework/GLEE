"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my best offer at this time, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal.  My final offer is $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  Let me know your decision.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $920,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,6,
