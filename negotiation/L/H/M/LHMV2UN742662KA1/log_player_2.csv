Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $650,000, but I'm not sure I can go higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}

Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

```

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $740000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the final round of negotiations with Alice, and her offer is still above my target price.  While I could make another counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll accept it, and I risk losing out on the product altogether. Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a sure thing, even though it's not my ideal price. It's better to secure the product than to gamble on a potentially unsuccessful final round with Alice."
