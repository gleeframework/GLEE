Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the product's value, I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time. This is a fair price given the market value and my current financial capacity. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still too far from my minimum.  Let's see if I can negotiate Bob up further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm prepared to go up to $775,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and my financial limitations. Let's make a deal.

Bob is unlikely to move much higher.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
