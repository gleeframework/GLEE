,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you as you value it at $120. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're on a budget, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $101?  It's a fair price for both of us.",101.0,Alice,5,
