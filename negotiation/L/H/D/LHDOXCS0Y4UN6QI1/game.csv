"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. Given the value of the product to both of us, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but I need a price that works for my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my comfortable price point. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our needs. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to close the deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
