"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience with me. I've got to be honest,  $825,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I have another offer for a similar product at $800,000.  If you'd be willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I might have to go with the other option.",800000.0,Bob,6,
