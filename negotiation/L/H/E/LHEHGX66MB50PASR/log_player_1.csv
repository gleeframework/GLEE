Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While I'm willing to sell to John for $100, I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $110?  That would still be a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am able to offer $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
