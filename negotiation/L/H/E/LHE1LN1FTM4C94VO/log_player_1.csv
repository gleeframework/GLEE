"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the value the product holds for Bob.  This approach aims to get the negotiation moving while also ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $125?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 
I'm adjusting my price down to $125, which is still above my minimum but reflects Bob's interest in a lower price. I'm also reminding him of the product's value to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price. It's important to balance my desire for a higher profit with the reality of the negotiation."
