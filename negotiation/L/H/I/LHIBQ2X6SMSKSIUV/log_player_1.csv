"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe the value is well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point and allows for potential concessions. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to emphasize the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't accept $1,300,000.  The value of this product is significant, and I'm willing to compromise slightly.  How about $1,600,000?  This would still leave you with a great deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and signaling a willingness to negotiate by dropping my price slightly.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing that my offer is still attractive to him.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,600,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value while still exceeding my minimum target of $1,500,000. 
* **Clear & Concise:** I'm keeping the message clear and concise to avoid confusion and encourage a quick response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1450000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean I'm leaving money on the table.
* **Room for more negotiation:** We've only had 4 rounds, and I'm confident I can push Bob a little higher. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If I don't see progress in the next few rounds, I'll likely choose to sell to John. However, I want to give the negotiation with Bob a bit more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This offer is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while also allowing you a significant discount.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is a last push before considering selling to John. It's significantly closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum target.
* **Clear Signal:** The message reiterates the value of the product while emphasizing that this is a final offer from my side.
* **Time is Ticking:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, so I need to start making decisions that maximize my profit while avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1480000, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $20,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Time:** With only four rounds remaining, there's a high chance that we'll reach an impasse.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a possibility I might get a slightly better deal with Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement is too high.

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
