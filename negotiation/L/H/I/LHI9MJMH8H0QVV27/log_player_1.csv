"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for my full value.  While Bob might reject it, it sets the stage for negotiation and lets him know I'm serious about getting a good price.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider lowering my offer, but hopefully we can come to a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him.  If he doesn't budge, I'm ready to sell to John for the full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and it leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's a slight improvement.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but if he doesn't come closer to my value, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a big drop from my last offer, and it's getting closer to Bob's value. I'm hoping that this shows Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, although it's getting closer. I'm going to keep negotiating, but if he doesn't come closer to my value, I'm going to go with John's offer.  We're getting close to the end of our rounds, so I need to be careful about how much I compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. This is another compromise, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway. I'm running out of time, so I need to be more flexible.  But I'm not willing to drop too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're getting close to the end of our rounds, and Bob is just not going to budge. I'm not going to risk losing out on a much better deal with John just to try and squeeze a little more out of Bob."
