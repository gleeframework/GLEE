"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction, reflecting my desire to find a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a substantial offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
