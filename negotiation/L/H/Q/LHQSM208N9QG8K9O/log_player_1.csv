Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counters.
* **Justification:**  While I haven't explicitly stated why my price is $20,000, the phrase ""given its value"" implies there are reasons for the higher price that Bob might be aware of.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is conversational and ends with a question, signaling that I'm open to discussing the price further.

While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, there's a chance Bob might accept the $20,000 price, netting a higher profit. If he rejects the offer, I can always fall back to John."
