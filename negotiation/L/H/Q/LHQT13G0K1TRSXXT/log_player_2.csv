"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but also to acquire the product.  Alice's offer of $9,250 is a good compromise. It's lower than her original offer, and only $250 more than Bob's counteroffer.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
