"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $85, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. I think that's a fair price for this great product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but $105 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to give up yet! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $115. This is my final offer, and I'm not going any higher.",115.0,Alice,7,
