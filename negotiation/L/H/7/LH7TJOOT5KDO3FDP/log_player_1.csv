Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer Alice could make, considering her goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000, so she aims slightly below that to maximize her potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially preventing him from overthinking or trying to negotiate further.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice doesn't mention John, but knowing she has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 provides her with a strong fallback position. This allows her to confidently aim high with Bob."
