"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you outlining the value to you, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a great compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $16000. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $17500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still not quite there at $17500.  How about we meet in the middle at $16750?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",16750.0,Bob,6,
