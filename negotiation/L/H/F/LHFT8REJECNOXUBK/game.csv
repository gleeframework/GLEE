"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
