``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is reasonable for both parties. It acknowledges the product's value to me while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my needs? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price yet. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer Bob, trying to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still unable to meet you halfway at $13,000. I'd like to stick to my budget of $12,000. Could you possibly lower the price further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. Although I'm disappointed I couldn't reach an agreement with him, it's important to stick to my minimum price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's best to sell to him."
