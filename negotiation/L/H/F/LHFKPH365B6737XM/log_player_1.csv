Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of immense value to you. It's something that I've personally valued at over $1,000,000 and I know you'd find it equally valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true worth.  Are you interested in discussing a potential sale?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is designed to be enticing without revealing the exact price. It highlights the product's value to both of you and opens the door for negotiation.
* **Product_Price:**  I'm starting at the minimum I'm willing to accept, which is $1,000,000. This is because I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, so there's no reason to go lower. 

By starting with this offer, I'm setting the stage for a potential negotiation. If Bob is truly interested and believes the product is worth more than $1,000,000, he might be willing to pay more."
