"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common in negotiation to start with a higher price, leaving room for bargaining. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""open to negotiation,"" I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Value Proposition:** ""Amazing product""  hints at the product's worth without revealing my minimum. 
* **Round 1 Strategy:** It's too early to go too low in the first round. I want to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's initial offer of $8,500 shows interest, suggesting a possibility for a better price.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process, potentially getting closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:**  While $8,000 is my safety net, I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Meeting Bob halfway is a gesture of good faith and signals I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Value Emphasis:**  ""Worth every penny"" subtly reinforces the product's worth, potentially swaying Bob.
* **Strategic Price Point:**  $9,250 is a compromise that still leaves me room to negotiate in the next round if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to carefully analyze his counteroffer and my remaining rounds.
* I'll need to consider John's offer ($8,000) as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum, but it's also what John is offering.
* **Limited Negotiation:**  We are already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds to reach a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  It's a high risk to continue negotiating with Bob, as he's already shown reluctance to go higher. There's no guarantee we'll reach a better deal in the remaining rounds.
* **Certainty of John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price with no risk of losing the sale.

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed $8,000, which is my minimum and the most I can be certain of achieving in the remaining rounds."
