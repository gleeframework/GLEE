Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  It's lower than the product's value to him, making it worthwhile for Bob to consider. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum, it's still far from the product's value to him, and it's lower than your initial offer.  There's room for negotiation.  It's worth making a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'd be willing to come down to $85. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $85 is still a bit much.  How about we split the difference and do $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $77 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum, and it's clear that he's unwilling to go much higher.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob.  John is a guaranteed sale at your minimum, so selling to John is the most sensible option."
