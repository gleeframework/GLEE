"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product that I think you'd really find useful. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is a bit too high. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is courteous but clearly states my price point. 
* **Strategic Goal:**  My ideal outcome is to pay close to Alice's value of $120, maximizing my savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a solid price, saving me $25 off Alice's initial offer and only $5 more than her value.
* **Limited Time:**  We're only on round 3 of 10. While I might be able to negotiate a few more dollars off, it's not worth the risk of Alice increasing her price or me running out of time. 
* **John's Price:**  John's offer of $150 is a last resort.  Getting the product for $125 is a much better outcome."
