"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He's aiming for a price under $800,000, and $950,000 is too high.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to push Alice closer to his target price. This sets the tone for negotiation and leaves room for potential compromises in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob is still aiming for a price below $800,000. Although Alice has come down from her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation to achieve a better price. It's worth exploring further options before committing to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob is now making his final offer, aiming for his target price of $800,000. This is a bold move, and it's likely Alice will either accept it or reject it."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's not his ideal price, it's only $25,000 above his target price, and he's already been through several rounds of negotiation.  He's close to his goal, and there's a risk of Alice walking away or Jhon changing his mind.  This is a good opportunity to close the deal and secure the product."
