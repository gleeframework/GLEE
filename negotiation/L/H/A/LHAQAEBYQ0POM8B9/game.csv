"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value of this product, I can go down to $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer reflecting its worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I recognize its value, $950,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $725,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer. I can be flexible, but not to that extent. My final offer is $850,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's more than fair considering what you're getting.",850000.0,Alice,5,
