"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is less than your maximum, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value to Alice is $80.  I believe there's a good chance she'll accept this offer, as it's still above her value and allows her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $100 is still higher than the product's value to her. It's also closer to my maximum value, but I still believe we can negotiate a better price. I'll reject this offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $100 and my previous offer of $85.  It's still within my budget and likely leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This should be a more appealing offer for Alice than her last one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still too high. While I'm running out of rounds, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer of $105 was a step back from her previous offer of $100, but I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my target. I'm increasing my offer to $95, meeting her halfway from her last offer. It's still a decent price for her, considering her value of $80, and it's closer to my maximum budget. This might encourage her to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is getting close to my maximum value of $120, and we are running out of rounds. However, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is getting very close to my maximum, and we're running out of time. I'm increasing my offer to $100, meeting her halfway from her last offer and giving her a decent profit. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's the best chance to secure a deal before I have to buy from John.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, Alice's offer of $115 is too high.  It's getting uncomfortably close to my maximum value of $120.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $120 and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting my final counteroffer, leaving me with no deal."
