"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $8,750 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $9,000.  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about the product's value, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $8,750. I'd like to make a final offer of $8,500, and that's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000",8500.0,Bob,6,
