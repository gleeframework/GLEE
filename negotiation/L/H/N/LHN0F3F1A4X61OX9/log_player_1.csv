Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $90.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $85. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer of my own.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $95. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I'm willing to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer.
