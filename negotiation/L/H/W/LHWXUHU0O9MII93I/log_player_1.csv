{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a $600,000 profit margin, which is significant. It also leaves me with a $100,000 profit, which is better than selling to John at a lower price.  

This is a strategic starting point for the negotiation.  I want to see if Bob will counter-offer, and what his strategy might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget though.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.   While selling to John is an option, I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob first. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a profit of $500,000.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable price point.  This counteroffer is a good compromise and might be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $700,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  $700,000 would leave me with a large loss, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much better option. However, I am not going to jump to John just yet. I will attempt one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $900,000. This would still give you a good profit margin, and it would allow me to recoup some of my investment.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight concession from my previous offer. I believe it is a good balance between securing a fair price and maintaining a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer. This offer represents a substantial profit for Bob, and it is closer to my desired price point."
