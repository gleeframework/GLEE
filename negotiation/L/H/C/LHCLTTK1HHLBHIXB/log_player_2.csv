"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $130.** This is a good price for Bob because it's less than his maximum budget of $150. 
* **Buying from John would cost Bob $150.** This is more expensive than buying from Alice.

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
