"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm going to have to counter with $950,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, considering the value you've placed on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a bit more than our previous midpoint, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,075,000. Let's aim for a number that's a bit closer to our previous midpoint. I'll offer $1,037,500. This is a reasonable compromise that recognizes the product's value while also keeping within my budget.",1037500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually agreeable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,037,500, which would be $1,056,250. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our needs.",1056250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. However, $1,056,250 is still a bit outside my budget. To make this deal work, I'm going to need to go a bit lower. I'm offering $1,025,000, which is a significant step closer to our previous midpoint.  I believe this shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, but we're also getting very close to my maximum.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, which is just $15,000 above your latest offer. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1030000.0,Alice,9,
