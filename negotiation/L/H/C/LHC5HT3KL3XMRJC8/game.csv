Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a price closer to $1000000 to make it work.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value you've described.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it represents a fair price considering both our positions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1320000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1320000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to offer $1280000. I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the value of the product, while also respecting our respective needs.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1280000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
