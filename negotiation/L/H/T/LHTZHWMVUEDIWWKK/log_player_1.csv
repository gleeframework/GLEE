{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but still significantly above my minimum price. I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to potentially get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm proposing $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial offer, Bob's counteroffer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum and a significant improvement over his previous offer. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
