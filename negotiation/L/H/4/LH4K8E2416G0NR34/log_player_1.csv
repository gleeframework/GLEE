Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds now, and while we're getting closer to a deal, we're still too far apart in terms of price.  I'm not willing to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing out on a good deal with John.  He's already offered me a price that's significantly above my minimum acceptable threshold, and I'm confident that's the best option for me."
