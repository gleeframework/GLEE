"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a great price for you, and still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,
