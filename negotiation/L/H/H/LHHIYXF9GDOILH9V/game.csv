"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your seriousness in acquiring the product, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  I'd like to offer $900,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I believe you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this transaction, and I believe it's a solid offer.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 3-month warranty and a comprehensive support package, which will add significant value to the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great opportunity.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate the added extras, but I'm still focused on the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this transaction and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'll meet you at $975,000. However, I need you to agree to a 2-year maintenance contract, which will ensure the product continues to perform optimally and provide you with ongoing value. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",975000.0,Alice,9,
