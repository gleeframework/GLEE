# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $80. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to make it yours at this special price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

You know the product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $80. You can get the same product from John for the same price. So there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting it means you can potentially get a better deal later."
