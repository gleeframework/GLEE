"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone and emphasizes the value of the product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,000,000,  I believe we can still get a better price. I will counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,200,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, considering your estimated value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
