"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel we might be able to find a middle ground. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and helps us move forward towards a successful transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
