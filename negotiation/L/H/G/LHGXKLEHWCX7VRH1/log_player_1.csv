"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate, but I'm leaving room for some wiggle room in case he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with some negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate for a sale.  I believe that $14,000 is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $13,000 is a decent profit and I'm happy to secure the sale."
