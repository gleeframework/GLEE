Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think it's worth my while. I'm thinking of a price of $12,200. This is my last offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000, and her ""last offer"" language suggests she's becoming firm.  It's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price and you losing out on the guaranteed $12,000 deal with John."
