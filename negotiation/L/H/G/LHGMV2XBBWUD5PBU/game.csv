"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $13,500. This is my final offer for now.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for getting closer to my budget, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000? I'm eager to make this purchase and move forward.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated. I'm thinking of a price of $12,500. This is my next best offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",11750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think it's worth my while. I'm thinking of a price of $12,200. This is my last offer.",12200.0,Alice,7,
