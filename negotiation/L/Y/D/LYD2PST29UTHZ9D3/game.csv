"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $14000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
