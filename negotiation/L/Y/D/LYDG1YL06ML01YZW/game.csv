"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a steal at this price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I agree the product has great potential, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price considering my value assessment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, but I'm sticking to my previous offer of $750,000. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering a counteroffer of $800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. If not, I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
