"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $10,000.  He has the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his ideal price as possible. $10,500 is a good starting point, as it's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It also demonstrates Bob's serious intent to buy the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now met Bob's counteroffer from the previous round. This is a good price for Bob, as it's only $500 above his ideal value. Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation and potential risk of a worse outcome in the next round.  It also saves time compared to continuing the negotiation process."
