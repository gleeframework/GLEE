"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount, and I believe it can be a valuable asset for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm prepared to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $1,200,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
