"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above his $10,000 limit. He should try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. While I am interested in your product, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  While she's willing to compromise, it's not enough.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price. He still has several rounds left and he's already shown he's willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice is moving closer to his target, $11,250 is still above his $10,000 limit. It's worth trying to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John. Bob can still make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I value your product, $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'm not sure if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I can offer you a price of $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,000 is still above Bob's budget. With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to make a decisive move.  Buying from John for $10,000 is the most financially sensible option at this point.  He's saved a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offers, and he doesn't want to risk going over his budget with only a few rounds remaining."
