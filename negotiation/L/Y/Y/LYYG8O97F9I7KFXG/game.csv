"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I am interested in your product, $12000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000.  Let's see if we can find a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I value your product, $11250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10750. This is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'm not sure if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I can offer you a price of $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
