"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm thinking of a price around $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $150 is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking something closer to $60 would be more reasonable. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

We're starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. It's a negotiation tactic to get a more favorable final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. Could you do $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $75? That's a fair jump on my end."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're moving closer to our limit, but still aiming for a price below $80. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, I have another offer for $120, but I'd prefer to work out a deal with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems we've reached an impasse. Alice is unlikely to go below $95, and that's more than our $80 limit. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
