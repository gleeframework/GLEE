"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. Could you do $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $75? That's a fair jump on my end.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, I have another offer for $120, but I'd prefer to work out a deal with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? ",95.0,Alice,5,
