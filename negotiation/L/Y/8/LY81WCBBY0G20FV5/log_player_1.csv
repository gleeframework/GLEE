{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but also leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $102.50 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll make one more counteroffer before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm trying to be flexible here, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 100}
