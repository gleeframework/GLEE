"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a significant discount for you, while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's try to find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
