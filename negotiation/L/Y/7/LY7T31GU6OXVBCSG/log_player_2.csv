You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always go to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm also trying to get a good deal. I'm hoping she'll meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I want to see if I can get Alice down further. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round.  I'm hoping to show Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a good price.  This is a compromise, and I'm hoping she'll accept it or counter with something close to this.  I'm also mindful of John's price of $10,000 and don't want to go too much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is getting closer, it's still above my target.  I want to see if I can get Alice down to $11,000 or close before resorting to buying from John.  There's still potential for a better deal here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still below her last offer, demonstrating my commitment to negotiating a fair price. I'm hoping this is close enough to her desired price to secure a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, and I'm getting closer to my limit.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of the price going back up or getting stuck in a loop is high.  John's offer of $10,000 is the best deal I can guarantee at this point.  It's time to end the negotiation and secure the purchase."
