{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing that this is a product worth at least $8,000 to me. This allows room for negotiation and gives me some bargaining power.
* **Open to negotiation:** I explicitly mention being open to negotiation to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I keep the message friendly and positive, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer, considering his willingness to negotiate and the potential of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  While $9,500 is close to my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to my initial offer of $10,000.
* **Seeking higher value:**  I want to maximize my profit and am not in a rush to sell to John, so I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I will consider factors like Bob's willingness to negotiate and the potential for a quick agreement versus risking a sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price a bit closer to my initial ask.  Would you consider $9,750?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is a compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by increasing my offer from $9,500 to $9,750. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning provided:** I explain my reasoning for the counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product. This builds trust and potentially encourages Bob to accept.
* **Positive and engaging tone:** I maintain a friendly and conversational tone to keep the negotiation flowing. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll secure the sale. If he rejects, I'll have to decide between making another counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering my budget, I am comfortable offering $9600 for the product. This amount still allows me to stay within my financial limits while acknowledging the value of the item. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $9,600 is only slightly below my minimum of $8,000, making it a worthwhile sale.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Further negotiations could prolong the process and might not yield a significantly higher price.
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, there's a chance he might get frustrated and walk away.

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures a quick and profitable transaction without risking a loss due to further negotiation."
