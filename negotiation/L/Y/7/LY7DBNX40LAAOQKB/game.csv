"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly below my bottom line. This product is really high-quality, and I'm confident it's worth more.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a high-quality product, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and call it $120?  That's a fair deal for a product of this quality.",120.0,Alice,5,
