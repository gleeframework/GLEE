"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed and potentially secure a price closer to your ideal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value for the product. Accepting would mean selling at a significant loss.  While John offers a guaranteed $120, there's still room to negotiate with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly below my bottom line. This product is really high-quality, and I'm confident it's worth more.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stand Firm:** By coming down in price, we signal to Bob that we're willing to negotiate. However, the significant drop from our initial offer to $140 shows we're serious about getting a fair price.
* **Middle Ground Tactic:** Aiming for the middle ground (even though it's still above Bob's stated maximum) can sometimes be an effective negotiation strategy. It might prompt Bob to counter with a more reasonable offer closer to his true willingness to pay. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** We're still above John's offer, so we haven't compromised our safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a high-quality product, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a price we might accept, $100 is still below our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and call it $120?  That's a fair deal for a product of this quality."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reach Our Minimum:** We've reached our absolute bottom line of $120, matching John's offer.
* **Final Offer:** By phrasing it as ""splitting the difference,"" we imply this is our final offer, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Time Pressure:** As we get closer to the 10-round limit, introducing a bit of time pressure can help push the negotiation forward."
