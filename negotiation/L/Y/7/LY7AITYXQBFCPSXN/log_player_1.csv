Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:** This high offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level and potential for negotiation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's room to negotiate down towards $1,000,000 while still securing a profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to justify the high price, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value of the product.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit by exploring Bob's willingness to pay a premium while still having the safety net of John's offer."
