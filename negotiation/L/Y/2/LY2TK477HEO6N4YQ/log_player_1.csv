Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Can we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $13,500.  That still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this sale. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. How about we meet at $12,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still not happy with the price.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I want to make this work. However, $12,250 is simply too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to drop a little more, and I'm offering $13,000 as my final offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, which would be $12,500. However, I'm willing to compromise and go slightly lower to $12,750. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, $12,750 is above my minimum and getting closer to my target. With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep pushing.  I'll accept and secure the sale."
