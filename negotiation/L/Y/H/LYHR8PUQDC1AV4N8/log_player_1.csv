"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $10,000 mark.  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, so it's more profitable to take the sure thing."
