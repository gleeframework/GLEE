Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe its value is significant and would be a great asset to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, potentially increasing Bob's perceived worth and willingness to pay a higher price."
