"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for your product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $16500.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $15500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
