"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1800000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $1200000 at this time.  This is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a better price for this incredible product.

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go any higher than $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're serious about buying this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1500000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for this unique product.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
