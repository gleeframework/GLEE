"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This price still represents a great value for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
