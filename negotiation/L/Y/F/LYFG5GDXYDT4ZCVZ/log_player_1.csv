Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin above my minimum, but is hopefully still attractive enough for Bob to consider.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully a more reasonable starting point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is a compromise, lowering my price slightly but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I won't settle for anything too low."
