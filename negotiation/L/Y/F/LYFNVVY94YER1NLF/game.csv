"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and agree on $950,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground, so I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in it.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to offer you $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering our previous negotiations, and it allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $975,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's close to the middle ground, so I'll offer it to you for $1,012,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in it.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
