"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at a starting price of $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum allows room for negotiation.  
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how far apart your valuations are. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind you have John as a backup who will pay your desired price, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and his own valuation of the product. This suggests he's trying to negotiate a very favorable deal. Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer will:

* **Signal your bottom line:** You won't accept a price drastically below your minimum.
* **Encourage a more realistic offer:** Bob might be more willing to move closer to your asking price if he knows you're serious about getting a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Moving down from your initial offer shows you're open to negotiation. 
* **Still Above Bob's Valuation:** The $17,000 price is still above Bob's $12,000 valuation, giving you room to potentially go lower while still making a profit. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  This counteroffer keeps the price closer to your desired range and avoids appearing desperate to sell quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below his own valuation of the product ($12,000). This indicates he likely has room to go higher.  You have the security of John's offer, so there's no need to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what you know Bob is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. I'm aiming for a deal that's fair for both of us.  How about we settle at $15,000 even? This seems like a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer holds firm at your minimum acceptable price. It sends a clear signal that you're not willing to go any lower.
* **Appeals to Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" you're emphasizing a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Time Pressure:**  As the rounds progress, you're getting closer to the point where selling to John might be more appealing if Bob isn't willing to meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for explaining.  I can go a bit higher, but $15,000 is still too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has now reached his true valuation of the product. It's unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **Profitable Deal:** While not your ideal price, $12,000 is still a significant profit over selling to John for $15,000 (who is essentially your ""break-even"" option). 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation and allows you to move on.

While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and losing the deal outweighs the potential for a relatively small gain."
