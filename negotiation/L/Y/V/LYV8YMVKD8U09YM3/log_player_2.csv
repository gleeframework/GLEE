"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value and potential impact, I propose a price of $11,000 for it. This offer takes into account both the cost of production and the significant value it holds for you. I am confident that this investment will pay off in the long run, helping you achieve your goals more efficiently. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information to consider this offer. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. She might be willing to lower it further to avoid losing the sale."
