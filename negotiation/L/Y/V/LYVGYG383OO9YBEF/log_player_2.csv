# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial price, but still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. Since Alice's initial price was $900,000, I'll offer $750,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll try to meet Alice halfway, so I'll offer $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay. Since Alice's last offer was $850,000, I'll offer $825,000, which is a $25,000 reduction from her last offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. Is that something we can work with?"", ""product_price"": 825000}"
