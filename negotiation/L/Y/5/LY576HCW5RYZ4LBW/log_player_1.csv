"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to try and incentivize him to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000).  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting such a low offer would be a huge loss. I need to counteroffer to find a more suitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is far below my minimum price, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This gives us both some room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while firmly stating my minimum acceptable price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $1,100,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's, demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Keeping Negotiation Open:** I'm again emphasizing that I'm open to continued discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer. To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I could go up to $700,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, it's still not close enough. I need to push for a higher price to ensure I get a reasonable return on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one more concession.  I'm prepared to drop the price to $900,000. This represents a significant drop from my initial offer and should be within your range. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  I'm reiterating that $700,000 is unacceptable while also indicating willingness to negotiate further.
* **Final Concession:**  This counteroffer represents a substantial drop from my initial offer, showing a genuine attempt to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize Shared Goal:**  I'm framing the negotiation as a search for a mutually beneficial outcome, hoping to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously."
