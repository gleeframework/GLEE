{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price that I believe is fair for both of us. Considering its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. This leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1450000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1300000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm aiming for a higher price, it's worth exploring further negotiation before selling to John. I believe there's still potential to find a compromise closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has moved closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I want to see if we can get closer to $1,400,000 or above before accepting.  There's still room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can reach a more favorable outcome if I keep pushing."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's getting closer, but we're running out of rounds. I need to secure a price that reflects the product's true value.  I'm going to counter with a price that bridges the gap, but if Bob doesn't meet me halfway, I'm going to sell to John."
