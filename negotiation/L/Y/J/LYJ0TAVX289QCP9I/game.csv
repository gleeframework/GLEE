"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice. How about we split the difference on your last offer? Would you be willing to settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up on my target price just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. How about we meet at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000, and I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal?",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 even though I think that's a bit high.  If you don't accept this, I'm going to have to walk and buy from John.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
