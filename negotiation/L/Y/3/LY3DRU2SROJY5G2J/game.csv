"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle for $15,000 just yet.  It's a valuable product, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we split the difference and go with $16,500?  That's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and leaves some room for negotiation.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $16,500. Would it be possible to consider $16,000 as a compromise?",16000.0,Bob,4,
