"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no benefit to accepting it right away.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  This product does sound intriguing, but I'm going to need to start a bit lower.  I'm interested in purchasing it for $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This shows I'm serious about buying but also pushes for a lower price.  We'll see how Alice reacts and adjust my strategy based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you'd like to start lower, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my maximum, but it's still above my ideal price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If she rejects again, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap a bit further.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, showing I'm serious about buying and willing to compromise. This offer is still within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to Alice's previous offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get a deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1000000 yet. I'm willing to go a bit higher to meet your needs, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than my last counteroffer. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate further. The difference is small enough that it's better to accept the deal and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
