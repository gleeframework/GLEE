"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down and still potentially get a great deal.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** By starting high, I can see how eager Bob is to buy. If he flat out rejects it, I know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, it might indicate stronger interest. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have John as a backup who will pay my minimum, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below both my asking price and my minimum acceptable price. While I want to get a good deal, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Significant Reduction:** By dropping $30, I'm making a substantial move to demonstrate my interest in closing a deal.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** My target price of $170 is still comfortably above my minimum of $150 and a good margin above Bob's offer of $120.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm anticipating Bob might counter again, so I'm leaving some space for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price. I'm willing to pay $150 for it, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could try to push for a bit more, it's unlikely he'll go higher, and I risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting this offer ensures I get a fair price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
