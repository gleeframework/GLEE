"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about $88?  That's closer to what I can afford and still a good deal for you.",88.0,Bob,4,
