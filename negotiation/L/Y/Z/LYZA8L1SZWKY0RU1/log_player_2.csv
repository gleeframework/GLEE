"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price. $95 is still too close to your maximum price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll do $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.

$90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
