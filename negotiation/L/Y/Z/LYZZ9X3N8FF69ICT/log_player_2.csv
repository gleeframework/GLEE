"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer to see how much bargaining room there is. It's still a bit above what Alice values the product at, so there's a chance she might accept. If not, we can always negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice is getting closer to her minimum, but there's still room to negotiate. I'll try to meet her halfway between our last offers."
