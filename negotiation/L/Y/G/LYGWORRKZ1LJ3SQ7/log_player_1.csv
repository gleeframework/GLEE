I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
