"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a significant price point for me, so I hope you'll consider it.  Let's try to close this deal!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, as I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you about your budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This is a big concession on my part, so I hope we can close this deal now. Let me know your decision.",13250.0,Alice,5,
