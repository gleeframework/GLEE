You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $75. How about we try $79? It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $79 is a good price.  While we might be able to get it a little lower, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of Alice walking away or the certainty of paying $100 to John."
