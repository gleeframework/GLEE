"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and value, it's worth noting that this item holds a significant importance to me, reflecting its true worth at $15000. However, considering your appreciation for the product, which aligns closely with its value at $12000 to you, I aim to find a mutually beneficial solution. To open our discussion, I propose a price of $13500. This offer allows us to bridge the gap between our perceived values while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. Let me know if you're interested in exploring this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
