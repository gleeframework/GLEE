"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $160? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $120, but I'm trying to stick to my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
