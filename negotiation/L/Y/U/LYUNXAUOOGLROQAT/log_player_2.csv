"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close as possible to his maximum of $12,000.  Offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price.  While it's closer to Bob's desired price than the initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to slowly inch towards a price closer to his limit.  Offering $13,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal. It also leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer, which could lead to a final price within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While continuing to negotiate is an option, the risk is that Alice may continue to raise the price.  It's now more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum price, guaranteeing the purchase and avoiding potential further increases from Alice."
