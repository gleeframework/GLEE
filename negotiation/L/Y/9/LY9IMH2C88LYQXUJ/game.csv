"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While it seems interesting, I'm not sure I can justify $1500000 at this time. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it, based on my initial research.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. It's a unique item, and I believe it has the potential to bring a higher return on investment. Would you be willing to consider this revised price?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're hoping for a higher price, and I appreciate the effort you've made to come down to $1400000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1300000?  I'm confident that this product holds value, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
