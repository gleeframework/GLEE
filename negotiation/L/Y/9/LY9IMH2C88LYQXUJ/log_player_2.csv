"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm looking for $1500000 for it. It's a rare find, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is your maximum budget, so there's no reason to accept it right away. You can attempt to negotiate a lower price, even if it just means getting closer to your maximum.  If Alice rejects your counteroffer, you can always switch to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. It's a unique item, and I believe it has the potential to bring a higher return on investment. Would you be willing to consider this revised price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but you're still closer to your ideal price with your previous offer.  Rejecting again gives you the opportunity to counteroffer again and potentially push the price down further. There's still room for negotiation, and it's always better to try and get the best possible deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is only $50,000 higher than your last offer. This is a good compromise, and it's getting close to your ideal price.  While you could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise and you'll end up paying more.  Accepting her offer secures a good deal, and you're still saving $150,000 compared to buying from John."
