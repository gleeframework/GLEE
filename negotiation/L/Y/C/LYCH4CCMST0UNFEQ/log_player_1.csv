Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. However, $100 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. This is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
