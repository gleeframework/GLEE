"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $1,000,000 as possible while still maximizing my profit.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still think I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a decent price. Let's see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price. We still have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm still above my minimum value and think I can get Bob to meet me halfway.  We're running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value. We are getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm confident that I can't get a much better offer from him. If I reject this offer, I risk ending up with John's offer of $1,000,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the deal."
