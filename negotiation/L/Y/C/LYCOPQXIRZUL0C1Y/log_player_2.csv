"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $890,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  Alice has come down to $890,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's counteroffer of $875,000. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a deadlock or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further. 
* **Saving money compared to John:**  $890,000 is still a better price than John's $1,000,000.

Bob can accept this offer and secure the product at a good price, saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
