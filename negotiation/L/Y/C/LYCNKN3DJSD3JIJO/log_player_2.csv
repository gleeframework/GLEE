"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $1200000 to you. We're confident this price reflects its value and potential benefits. Let us know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to potentially secure a lower price.  Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, it's prudent to explore further options before accepting."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal. However, I believe the price is a bit high considering my budget and the market value of similar products.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to present a counteroffer. Considering our costs and the value we place on the product, we are willing to negotiate at $1150000. This price reflects a compromise between our original valuation and your proposed offer. We hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a reasonable return for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is closer to my ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm determined to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer allows me to continue exploring lower prices through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my current budget. I'm ready to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant discount from your original offer and represents a good compromise. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. In light of your latest offer, we propose a counteroffer of $1100000. This price aims to strike a balance between our original valuation and your budget constraints. We hope this proposal will facilitate a successful transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the negotiations have gone back and forth several times.  Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer at $1,100,000 will save $400,000 compared to buying from John. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of reaching a stalemate or having Alice reject my next counteroffer is high.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price without jeopardizing the deal."
