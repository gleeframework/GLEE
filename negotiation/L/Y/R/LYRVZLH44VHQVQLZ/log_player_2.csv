"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present our premier product, which I believe could significantly enhance the efficiency and profitability of your operations. Given its unique features and capabilities, we estimate its value to be well beyond $1500000. However, recognizing the importance of collaboration and mutual benefit, I am extending an exclusive offer to you.

For a limited time only, you have the opportunity to acquire this game-changing product at a special introductory price of $1250000. This represents a substantial discount compared to our standard pricing, aimed at rewarding early adopters and fostering long-term partnerships.

Please consider this offer carefully. Should you decide to proceed, please let me know, and we can arrange for immediate delivery and setup to ensure a smooth transition.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. Even though it is a discounted price, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and move forward with buying from John."
