{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** I'm trying to be persuasive by highlighting the value to Bob and framing it as a great opportunity.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This price allows for negotiation while still maintaining a significant profit. I'm prepared to counter Bob's offers if needed, but also ready to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? This would allow me to make a fair deal while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, especially since John is willing to pay my asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if I can get closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $875,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while maintaining my firm position on the value of the product. I'm emphasizing that this is a fair compromise, aiming to find common ground and reach an agreement. 
* **Next Steps:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. If not, I'm prepared to further negotiate or potentially walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still need to stay within my budget. I propose we aim for $860,000. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while respecting our respective financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $860,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for less than $900,000. I believe there's still room for a compromise that benefits both of us."

```

**Explanation:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done my best to keep the negotiations moving forward. In light of this, I propose we settle on $880,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us to move towards a successful conclusion.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $880,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I've already negotiated several rounds and it seems clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my price.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a better deal with John. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee my minimum profit."
