"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible while still buying the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $15,000, which is Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Strategy:** It's always worth exploring if a lower price is possible. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob wants to start by significantly lowering the price to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:** $12,000 is still a decent price for Bob, leaving room for a middle ground if Alice counters.
* **Avoiding Immediate John Purchase:**  Bob wants to exhaust the negotiation with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counter-Offer:** $13,500 is a significant drop from the original $15,000 and shows Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Proposition:**  The price is within Bob's budget and represents a good savings compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely or running out of rounds. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
