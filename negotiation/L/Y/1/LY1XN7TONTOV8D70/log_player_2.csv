# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $1,100,000.  Since you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, you should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1050000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, but you can get it from John for $1,000,000. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
