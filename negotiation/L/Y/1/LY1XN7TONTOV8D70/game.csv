"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I have another offer for $1000000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1050000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
