Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I have another offer for $1000000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
