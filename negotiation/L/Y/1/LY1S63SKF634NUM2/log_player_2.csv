"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm setting the price at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $11,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. Since he values the product at $12,000, there's room for both Bob and Alice to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial asking price. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still do better than $10,500.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his desired price of $9,500.  There's still room for both parties to find a mutually beneficial deal."
