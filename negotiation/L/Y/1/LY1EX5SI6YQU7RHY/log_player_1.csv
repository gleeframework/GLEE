Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase this product. After careful consideration, I am interested in exploring a more reasonable price. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to my budget of $800,000? I appreciate your understanding.

You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. While I appreciate your offer, I must respectfully decline at this time. My budget remains at $800,000. I would like to continue our discussion and explore if there might be a way to reach an agreement closer to my budget. Please let me know if this is possible.

Bob is clearly anchored to his $800,000 valuation and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
