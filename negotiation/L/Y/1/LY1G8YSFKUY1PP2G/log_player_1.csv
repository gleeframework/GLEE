"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with an offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""value and potential,"" I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the price to a higher point.

This strategy allows me to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option open to negotiate down to a price that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is his perceived value, which is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I need to negotiate upwards.  While I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle during the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. It possesses features and capabilities that justify a higher price point. To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective but reiterate the product's value to justify a higher price. 
* **Significant Drop:** By decreasing my price by $200,000, I demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still remaining well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation towards a price point between Bob's offer and my initial ask, hopefully leading to a mutually acceptable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating, but his offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer again, moving closer to his price but not giving in entirely. I believe there's a chance he'll meet me closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. Let's settle this right now: How about $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Close:** By saying ""Let's settle this right now,"" I convey a sense of urgency and a strong desire to finalize the deal quickly.
* **Meet in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between my last counteroffer ($1,200,000) and his latest offer ($900,000). 
* **Firm but Fair:** While it's a significant concession on my part, it keeps the price above my absolute minimum, aiming for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise and demonstrates my willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum. At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure a sure profit."
