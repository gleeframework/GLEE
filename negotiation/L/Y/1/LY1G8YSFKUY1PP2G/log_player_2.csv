{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. It possesses features and capabilities that justify a higher price point. To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
