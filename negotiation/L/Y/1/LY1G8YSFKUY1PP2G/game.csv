"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. It possesses features and capabilities that justify a higher price point. To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. Let's settle this right now: How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise and demonstrates my willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
