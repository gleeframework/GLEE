"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500.

It's a fair price that still reflects its worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm prepared to offer $10,750 for the product. This price is still above your stated value and represents a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $10,900. This price is still a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
