"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still hopefully attractive enough to Bob to get the negotiation started. This leaves room for some bargaining if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer to try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum.  Hopefully this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for anything too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again, hoping we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm serious about getting at least this much for the product, but still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better offer. I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and see if I can push for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still try to get as close to my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $1,000 below my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. There's a good chance that if I reject his offer, I'll either have to settle for Jhon's offer or end up with nothing at all."
