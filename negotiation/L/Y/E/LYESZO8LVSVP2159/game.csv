"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to come down to $13000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13000 is a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $13500?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13250?  I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",13250.0,Bob,4,
