"Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I know you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you, and allows me to get a significant return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
