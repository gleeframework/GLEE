"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1800000. This is my final counteroffer for now.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I think the product brings. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1650000. This is my final counteroffer.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1650000, which is $1625000. Can you consider that?",1625000.0,Bob,6,
