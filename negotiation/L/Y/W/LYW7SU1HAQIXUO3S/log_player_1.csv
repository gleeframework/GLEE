Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can work something out.
