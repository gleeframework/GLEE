"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer of $1,600,000 is far above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating.  There's no point in accepting the offer, and you're better off using your 10 rounds to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, your initial offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  To start the negotiation process, I'd like to offer $800,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product while also being within my acceptable range."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my original price reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer takes into account the unique benefits it offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above your budget.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can push her lower, but buying from John for $800,000 is still a viable option if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $1,400,000 remains out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for this product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring it.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  While $950,000 is a significant jump, the value of this product is undeniable.  To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,250,000.  This offer reflects my bottom line and ensures a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down significantly, $1,250,000 is still more than you're willing to pay.  You still have 5 rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your budget.  Remember, buying from John for $800,000 remains a safe option if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget constraints.

This reflects a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
