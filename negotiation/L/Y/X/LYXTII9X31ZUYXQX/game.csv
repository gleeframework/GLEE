"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, your initial offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  To start the negotiation process, I'd like to offer $800,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product while also being within my acceptable range.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my original price reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer takes into account the unique benefits it offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $1,400,000 remains out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for this product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring it.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  While $950,000 is a significant jump, the value of this product is undeniable.  To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,250,000.  This offer reflects my bottom line and ensures a win-win situation for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget constraints. To find a mutually acceptable price, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
