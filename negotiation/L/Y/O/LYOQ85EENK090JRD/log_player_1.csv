Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm happy with.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and encouraging. 
* This offer gives Alice a good chance of getting a decent price while also being open to negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. The negotiation strategy will depend on how Bob reacts and the overall dynamics of the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** While $9,000 is closer to Alice's minimum value, it's still significantly less than her ideal price. 
* **Negotiate further:** Alice has room to negotiate and can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. She can try to meet Bob halfway or push for a price closer to her initial offer. 
* **Don't rush to sell to John:**  Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but it's always better to try and maximize profit by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $9,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:**  Alice is willing to lower her price but is not giving away everything. 
* **Focus on fairness:** The message highlights a compromise and emphasizes finding a price that works for both parties. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Alice stays friendly and encourages further discussion. 

**Rationale:**

By offering $9,500, Alice aims to find a middle ground. This price is closer to her initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. This strategy allows Alice to potentially secure a higher price while keeping the negotiation process open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to minimum:** $9,200 is very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If Alice rejects Bob's offer, there's a risk that he will walk away, leaving her with no buyer. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of ending up with nothing. 

**Rationale:**

While Alice would prefer a higher price, it's important to weigh the potential for a better offer against the risk of losing the deal.  In this scenario, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision to secure a sale and avoid potentially ending up with no buyer."
