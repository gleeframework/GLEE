Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to negotiate down from a higher price. Starting at $1,200,000 gives you significant bargaining space. 
* **Justification for the price:**  Highlighting the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" might make Bob more amenable to a higher price, even if it's above his perceived worth.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussing the price further, which can lead to a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could choose to start lower or higher depending on your risk appetite and your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
