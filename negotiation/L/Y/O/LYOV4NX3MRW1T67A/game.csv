"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree on that.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to offer the product for $105, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,5,
