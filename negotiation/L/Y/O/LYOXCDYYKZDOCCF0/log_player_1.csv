Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  We have a strong alternative buyer (John) at $12,000, giving us leverage. We don't want to go below this price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a compelling offer for Bob and securing a significant profit for Alice."
