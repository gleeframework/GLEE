"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price of $15,000. I should try to negotiate a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This will hopefully encourage Alice to come down in price, especially since she has an incentive to sell the product rather than risk me walking away to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer. I believe I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some willingness to compromise, but her offer is still too high. I'll keep pushing for a lower price. While I'm getting closer to my maximum budget, there's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but this time by a smaller amount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go much higher. This is a subtle but important strategy to signal my willingness to compromise without giving up too much ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers. While I could try to squeeze a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $15,000 is too high. Accepting Alice's offer at $6,300 saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
