"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your operations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000, which is a significant discount from its true value. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $1400000. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to recover a bit more of the value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1350000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
