"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're making a serious effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $8,500.",8500.0,Alice,5,
