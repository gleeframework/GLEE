Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to start high and see if Bob is willing to pay my full value.  If he's not, I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't drop below $1,000,000. I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my full value, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm coming down a bit, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's more than what Bob offered.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my full value, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price.  This is a good compromise, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
