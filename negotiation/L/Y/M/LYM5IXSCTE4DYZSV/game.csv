"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's try $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering we're both trying to get the best possible deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is still a significant gap from what I need. I'm willing to come down to $11,500,  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a price you need to meet, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $10,500?  I'm getting closer to your price and hope we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,6,
