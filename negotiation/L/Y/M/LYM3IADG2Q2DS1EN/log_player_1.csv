Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This leaves you some wiggle room to potentially accept a counteroffer. 
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear you're willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, the goal is to get the highest price possible, but also to keep the negotiation moving.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have a backup offer from John.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $9,500, which is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my own interests. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,250. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and  represents a significant increase from Bob's original offer. This feels like a good compromise.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option for maximizing my earnings in this round."
