"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal quickly. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
