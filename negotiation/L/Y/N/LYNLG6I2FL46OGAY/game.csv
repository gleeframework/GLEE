"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $108.  Let's try to close this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad to hear that you're still interested in the product, Bob. I've considered your offer and am willing to meet you halfway. How about $109 for the product? It's slightly above your offer, but still below my initial asking price. I believe this is a fair compromise.",109.0,Alice,5,
