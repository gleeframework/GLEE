"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's price but still within your budget. It shows you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to your ideal price.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the $13,000 offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without taking unnecessary risks."
