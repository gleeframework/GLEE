{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can gauge his interest and potentially secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is far too low for me.  I'm not going to accept that offer. I will counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hmm, $125 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $95? That's a pretty big jump from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'll try to counteroffer again, but if Bob doesn't come up a bit more, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $110 is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 110}
