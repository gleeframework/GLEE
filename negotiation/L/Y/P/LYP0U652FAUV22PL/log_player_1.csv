"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better price.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to accept it right away. There are still 9 rounds left, and I can potentially get a better price.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate and that I value the product more than just my minimum. 
* **Potential for better outcome:**  There's a possibility that Bob might be willing to pay more if I push a little harder."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'd be happy to accept $13,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer to make it seem more logical.
* **Middle ground:** $13,500 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, making it a potentially acceptable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure if the product is worth $13500. I'd be willing to pay $13000, but I'd like to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the deal:**  $13,000 is a good price, and it's getting close to my initial asking price. With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming riskier to hold out for a higher offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob might go lower, but there's also a chance he might walk away.  Accepting his offer secures a decent profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with John's $12,000 offer. 
* **Moving forward:**  It's important to consider the overall negotiation strategy and weigh the potential for further gains against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
