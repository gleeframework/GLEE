Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit with Bob:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still attractive compared to losing the opportunity. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quickly.

**Why this approach is strong:**

* **Potential for Higher Gain:**  This offer could lead to Bob accepting a price significantly higher than his initial valuation.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we still have the guarantee of selling to John for our minimum acceptable price."
