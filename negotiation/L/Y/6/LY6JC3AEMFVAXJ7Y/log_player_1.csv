Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $140? That's a good compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 140}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob isn't likely to yield a significantly higher price. It's better to sell to John at a guaranteed $150, which is above my minimum and within my target range."
