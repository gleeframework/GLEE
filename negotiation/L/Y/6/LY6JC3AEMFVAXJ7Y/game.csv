"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $120 for your product.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $140? That's a good compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for your product.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is still a bit too low for me. To make this deal work, I'd need to come down to $135. This is my final offer, and it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $132 for your product.",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $132 isn't quite where I need to be. To make this deal work, I need to come down to $134.  This is very close to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",134.0,Alice,7,
