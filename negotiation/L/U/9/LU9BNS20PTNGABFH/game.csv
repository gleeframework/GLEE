"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $18,000 represents its true value, I understand your budget constraints.  Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
