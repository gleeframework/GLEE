"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but  $1,100,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a step closer to what I consider fair.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,137,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs, and it's a significant step towards a successful deal. Let's close this out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,137,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,137,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is consistently meeting in the middle, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price."
