"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to  $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair for the product's value.  I'm willing to continue negotiations with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but  $1,100,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a step closer to what I consider fair.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up a bit. How about $1,125,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer, it's still not at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing negotiations."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,137,500.
