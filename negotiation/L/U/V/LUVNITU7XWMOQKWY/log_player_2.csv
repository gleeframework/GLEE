"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I acknowledge its value, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and you're saving $150,000 compared to John's offer. It's a good deal at this point."
