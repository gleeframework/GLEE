"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a good starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation, but still gives me a good return on the product.  I'm not going to offer the full $1,200,000 right away because I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,150,000.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer him $1,125,000. This is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it's close enough to his desired price that he'll accept."
