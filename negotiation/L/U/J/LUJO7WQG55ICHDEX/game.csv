"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. But $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? That's a fair price that lets us both walk away happy.",12500.0,Alice,5,
