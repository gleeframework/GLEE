"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering its worth to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $9,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $7,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to offer a slight discount. I can sell it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
