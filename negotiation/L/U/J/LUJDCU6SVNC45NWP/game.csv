"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there on the $900,000 price point. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'd prefer.  How about we split the difference and agree on $937,500?  This allows us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen!",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $915,000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Bob,6,
