Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer ($1,200,000) because I know the product is worth more to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Fairness:** The offer is still below the product's worth to Bob, which might make him more likely to accept. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I am open to negotiation, which can help keep Bob engaged.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. 
* I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  While $900,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Bob's offer is lower than his initial interest, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  This gives me leverage to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* I'll remain aware of John's offer as a backup option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still holding onto a significant portion of the product's value to Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that even at $1,100,000, it's a good deal.
* **Maintaining Openness:** I'm using language that emphasizes my willingness to find a compromise, keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to continue.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!  I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to carefully consider his next offer and whether to accept, counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob has moved closer to my position, and his offer is now only $100,000 away from my initial counteroffer.
* **Mutual Benefit:** Bob emphasizes that this deal is ""good for both of us,"" highlighting the shared benefit.
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will come back with a better offer. He could walk away, and I would be left with only John's offer of $800,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer, securing a price significantly higher than John's offer. This ensures a successful transaction and maximizes my profit."
