"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,175,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us, and will allow us to move forward with this transaction.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too low on budget. How about we meet at $1,150,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still below what I need to consider. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial position. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
