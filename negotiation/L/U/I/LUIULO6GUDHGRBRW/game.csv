"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to purchase the product, but $850,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $740,000?",740000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still interested in making a deal with you. I can offer it to you for $760,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price, considering the value of the product.",760000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is as low as you're willing to go, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $750,000.  If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to meet you at $750,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm not going to give it away. I can offer it to you for $765,000, which is a compromise, but I think it's the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",765000.0,Alice,7,
