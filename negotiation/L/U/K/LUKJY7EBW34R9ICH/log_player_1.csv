I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still potentially appealing to Bob, given he values the product at $10,000. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round. I believe there's still room for improvement and I can potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a decent profit for me and a fair price considering Bob values the product at $10,000. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider while still allowing me to gain some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my initial price, it's a pretty good deal.  I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation could risk losing the sale entirely.  It's better to accept the offer and ensure the sale than risk ending up with nothing."
