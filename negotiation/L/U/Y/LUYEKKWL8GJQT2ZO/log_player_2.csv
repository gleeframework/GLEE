"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $10,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal considering its worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than buying from John for $12,000. Even though it's not the absolute lowest price, it still saves Bob $2,000."
