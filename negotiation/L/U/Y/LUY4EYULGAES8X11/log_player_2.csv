``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better deal."

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130? It's still a good deal for you and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can do $140, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction by lowering her price from $140, but $145 is still too high.  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a better price closer to your target of $130."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can do $140, but I think we can do even better than that. How about we meet in the middle at $140, and I'll throw in a small bonus for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $140, which is only $10 more than your target price of $130.  While it's not ideal, it's a good deal compared to John's price of $150.  Furthermore, Alice is offering a bonus, which adds further value to the deal. It's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly lower price, so accepting the offer is the best choice."
