"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I am confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose an initial offer of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,300,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it, which is my maximum offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $2,300,000 is a fair reflection of this product's true value and potential. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,750,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and hopefully a more realistic figure for us to consider.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1,900,000 is still slightly above what I can comfortably afford.  Let's try $1,800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
