"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in. I'm thinking $115 would be a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just isn't feasible for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This still leaves some room for me to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I really appreciate your efforts. I'd like to keep the negotiations open, so how about we aim for $105? It's a bit higher than my initial offer but still within a reasonable range.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is closer, but I'm still a bit below my desired profit margin. How about we compromise at $106?  This is a small step closer to my desired price, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",106.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Alice. Let's try $104.50. This is a step towards meeting your expectations while still staying within my budget.",104.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might be too far apart.  While I appreciate your persistence, $104.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.50 as a final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I may have to move on to another buyer.",105.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry to hear that, Alice. I truly value this product, but I'm afraid I can't go beyond $104. I hope we can find a way to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",104.0,Bob,8,
