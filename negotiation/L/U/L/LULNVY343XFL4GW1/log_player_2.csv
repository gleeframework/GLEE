Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already come close to his maximum price of $9,000 and it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  While he could still try to bargain down to $9,000, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $8,000 is too high."
