"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I think this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's worth to the right buyer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $825000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's make this deal happen.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $825000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
