Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Could we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1150000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept such a significant drop. How about $1,110,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 1110000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to move a bit higher to show I'm serious. Would you consider $1,090,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,090,000 is a strong outcome at this stage. Bob is clearly engaged and negotiating in good faith, but the increments are getting smaller.  Waiting longer carries the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling the negotiations. This offer secures a significant profit above my minimum."
