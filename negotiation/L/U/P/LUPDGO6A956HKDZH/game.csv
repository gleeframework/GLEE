"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900000 is tempting, it's below my minimum value. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer the product for $1000000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows us to move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $950000? I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum.  Let's try $975000. This leaves a bit of room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $960000. I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price and make it a win-win for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate that.  However, $960000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle on $990000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to close this deal.",990000.0,Alice,7,
