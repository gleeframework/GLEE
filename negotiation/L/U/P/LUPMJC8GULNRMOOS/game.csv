"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer already reflects a significant consideration from the product's true worth. I'm willing to move down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. To demonstrate my willingness to make a deal, I'll come down to $1,037,500. This is a significant concession and a very strong offer considering my other option. I need to have a decision from you this round, as my other buyer is ready to proceed.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not ready to pay $1,037,500. I'm willing to go up to $1,020,000, which is my absolute maximum. I hope we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
