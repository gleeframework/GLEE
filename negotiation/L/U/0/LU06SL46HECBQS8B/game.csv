"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,150? That way we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think!",11150.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your proposal, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11,000? That's the best I can do at this point. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
