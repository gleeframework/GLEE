Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value of the product to Bob. 

I'll be ready to respond to his counteroffer or accept his offer if he agrees to my price.  If the negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on that price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,150? That way we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your proposal, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11,000? That's the best I can do at this point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept it. This is a good outcome, as it's significantly higher than John's offer and still leaves a bit of profit for me. I'm happy to finalize the deal with Bob."
