"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential benefits.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price still reflects the product's potential and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1100000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1150000 as a final offer. This is a fair price that acknowledges both the product's value and your budget.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
