{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum. It allows for potential negotiation while still giving you a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$60 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
