Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:**  Framing the offer as a ""mutually beneficial deal"" subtly pressures Bob to consider accepting.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates willingness to negotiate, but not desperate to sell. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If it's too low, I'll be ready to counter or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still too low to consider accepting right now.
* **There's room for negotiation.** I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, knowing Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is an option, but I want to maximize my profit.**  I'll explore further negotiations with Bob before resorting to selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000. I'll emphasize that while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $1,150,000? This price is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm not going too low, but showing flexibility. This keeps me closer to my desired price and prevents giving away too much.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Again, emphasizing ""fair deal"" for both sides keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Solution-Oriented:** ""Let's find a solution"" implies I'm open to further discussion and compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a price closer to my desired range.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,125,000? This price is still a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $1,125,000 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,150,000.
* **Negotiations have stalled:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's unlikely to go higher, and further negotiations might lead to a deadlock.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a longer process, potentially jeopardizing the sale to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept the offer:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at a price that's relatively close to my minimum. This ensures I get a reasonable return without risking a lengthy negotiation process."
