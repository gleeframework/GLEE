"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in buying it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to keep my expenses lower. Could we possibly agree on $135? This would allow me to stay within my budget while also providing a reasonable price for you.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. How about we meet at $142.50? This is still a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $140? This would allow us to reach a fair compromise without exceeding my financial limits.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $142. However, I'll throw in a small bonus - I'll include a free accessory that's worth $10. Would you be willing to accept the deal at $142 for the product and the accessory?",142.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still looking to stay within my limit of $140. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $140 without the bonus accessory?",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're really trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140 without the accessory. How about we meet at $141, and I'll throw in a small discount on the product itself, so you'll still be getting a great deal?",141.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses at $140. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $140.50? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",140.5,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $140.50. How about we meet at $141.25? This is a small increase, but it's still a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",141.25,Alice,11,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're really close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $142, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",142.0,Alice,13,
