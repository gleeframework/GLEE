"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you.",140.0,Bob,4,
