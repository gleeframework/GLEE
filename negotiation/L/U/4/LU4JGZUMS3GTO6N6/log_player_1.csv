Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, but it leaves room for negotiation.  By giving Bob a reason to buy (that he'd enjoy it) I'm trying to make him feel like it's worth a little extra.  I'm also leaving the door open for counteroffers, which is important to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's worth more than $150 to me, and John is already willing to pay that.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is still higher than what John is offering, but it's a significant decrease from my initial price, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It also provides a reason for Bob to accept - a ""fair price"" - which might be more appealing than just a number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go lower than $150.  Even though I'd prefer to make a bit more, John is a guaranteed sale at $150. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting nothing."
