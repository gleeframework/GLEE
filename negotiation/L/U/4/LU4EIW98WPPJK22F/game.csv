"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it.  What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I appreciate your offer, $65 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we possibly meet in the middle at $75?  That would work much better for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting close to my budget.  I'd be willing to do $78, but that's really as high as I can go.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $82? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",82.0,Alice,7,
