"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I appreciate your offer, $65 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $82? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk Alice not budging further."
