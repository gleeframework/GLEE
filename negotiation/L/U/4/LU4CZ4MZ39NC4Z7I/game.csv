"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  Its value to you is significant, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's worth, but also leaves room for negotiation. Let's discuss!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, however, and I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This offers us both a good deal, and I'm confident it's a price that will be mutually beneficial.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
