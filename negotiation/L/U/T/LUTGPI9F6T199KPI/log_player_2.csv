You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,350,000 is lower than $1,500,000.
* **You can still make a profit:**  Even at $1,350,000, you're buying the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
