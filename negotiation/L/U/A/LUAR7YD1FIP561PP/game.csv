"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $8,000.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500.  It's still a fair value for the product, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $8,700. It's a small step up from your original offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground here.  $8,600 feels like a fair compromise for both of us.  This would be a significant saving for me, and you'd still get a price that's above what the product is worth to you.  What do you say?",8600.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,800. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer the product to you for $8,800. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my target price.",8800.0,Alice,7,
