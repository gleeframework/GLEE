Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a good investment for you. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but I still need to come in a bit lower. How about $12,250? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $12,250 is close to my minimum price and it's a good deal for both of us. It's better than selling to John for $12,000, and we've reached a compromise after several rounds."
