"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a good investment for you. ",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but I still need to come in a bit lower. How about $12,250? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",12250.0,Bob,4,
