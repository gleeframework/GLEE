"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend, and hopefully, it works for you too.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $95 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
