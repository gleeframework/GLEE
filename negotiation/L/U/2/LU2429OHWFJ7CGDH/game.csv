"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I had in mind. I'm willing to bump my offer to $14,000. Let's make this deal happen!",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you've been tough to negotiate with, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,250, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  Let's close this out!",14250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, but I'd like to add a condition: I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $500. This way, you'll get an even better deal. I'm sticking to my guns on the price, but I'm sweetening the pot.",14500.0,Alice,9,
