"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something of great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I could consider  $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Buying from Alice at $1,200,000 saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might be risky.**  Alice has already lowered her price, and continuing to bargain could risk her walking away, forcing Bob to buy at a higher price from John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial option at this point."
