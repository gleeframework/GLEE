Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm impressed by your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a stronger commitment from you. I'm now offering the product to you for $790,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and her latest offer is only $10,000 less than John's price. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation to potentially save such a small amount. Buying from John guarantees the product at a known, acceptable price."
