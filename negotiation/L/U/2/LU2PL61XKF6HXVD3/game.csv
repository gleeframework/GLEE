"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see that you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $825,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can offer $725,000. I believe that's a fair price and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $775,000.

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm impressed by your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a stronger commitment from you. I'm now offering the product to you for $790,000. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go, and I expect you to meet me at this price or walk away.",790000.0,Alice,7,
