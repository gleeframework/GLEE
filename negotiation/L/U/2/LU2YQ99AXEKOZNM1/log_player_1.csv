"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my value of the product while still leaving room for negotiation.  Since I know Bob values the product at $80, he has room to negotiate upwards. I'll see if he's willing to bite on this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I'll counter his offer, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $160. This is still significantly higher than his offer, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is now above my minimum value of $150.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is a good outcome. It secures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or a rejected offer."
