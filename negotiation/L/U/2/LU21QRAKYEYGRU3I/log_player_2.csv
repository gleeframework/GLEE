"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth at least $10,000 to her, but she is offering it to me for $15,000. Since I'm looking for a product worth no more than $8,000, I should reject her offer. I will buy the product from John for $8,000.
