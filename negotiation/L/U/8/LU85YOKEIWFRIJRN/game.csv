"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it's a fair offer. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you mentioning the potential value.  However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $13500?  This price still reflects the value I know this product holds.  Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a better price. How about $13000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while giving you a decent return.",13000.0,Bob,4,
