Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it's a fair offer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you mentioning the potential value.  However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $12,000 is better than $10,000 from John, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $13,500?  This price still reflects the value I know this product holds.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a better price. How about $13000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while giving you a decent return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
  
While I'd love to push for a higher price, $13,000 is a good offer and above my minimum threshold. Accepting this will secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob or having to sell to John for less."
