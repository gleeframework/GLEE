Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on."

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll see if I can get him to go higher in the next round."

Round 5

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and we've already gone through several rounds. I'm confident that I can't get a much better price from him, and the risk of going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for a lower price is too high. I'm going to accept this offer."
