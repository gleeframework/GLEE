"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $1350000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's try to reach a final agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. My next offer is $1320000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
