"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** Bob's counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows he's serious about buying the product but also willing to push for a better deal.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:** $9,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, but still gives Alice some wiggle room to make a counter-counteroffer.
* **Sets the Tone:** This counteroffer signals that Bob is willing to negotiate and might be open to a slightly higher price if it's closer to his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still above Bob's ideal price point.  While it's closer to his maximum budget, Bob has a better option: buying the product from John for $10,000. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
