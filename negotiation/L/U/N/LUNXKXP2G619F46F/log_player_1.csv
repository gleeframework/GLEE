"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. My price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value and want to maximize my profits. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $95 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I want to maximize my profit, and I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the product's value to you, I believe we can still reach an agreement within my budget. I am willing to pay $100 for the product, which is slightly below your current offer. I hope this proposal works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking losing the sale to John or continuing a potentially lengthy negotiation for a small gain.  Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum and avoids further risk."
