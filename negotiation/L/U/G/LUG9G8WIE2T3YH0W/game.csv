"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is simply too steep for me. Given my research and the product's current market value, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it still undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,750,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. This would allow us to both walk away with a profitable deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,625,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,625,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $1,500,000 represents a fair and reasonable price that benefits both of us. I'm willing to close the deal at this point, but I need to see a little more flexibility from you.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
