{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way over your budget.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John as a backup."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's closer to my budget."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again.  If I can't get a better deal, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below my maximum.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also trying to reach a price we both can agree on."
