{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $150 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible, but I also want to make sure the negotiation doesn't drag on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $140 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $140 is significantly lower than what I need to sell the product for. I'm willing to come down to $155, which is still a great price for this high-quality product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 155} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think I can find the product elsewhere for a bit less. I am willing to pay $145 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum value of $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing time and potentially ending up with less than John's offer. It's time to move on to a guaranteed sale."
