"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the product's worth to you.  It's highly unlikely you'll reach a deal within your budget if you accept. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and move towards a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way out of my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to go as high as $600,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low but not insulting offer tests Alice's flexibility.  While it's far from her asking price, it leaves room for negotiation and sets the stage for you to potentially reach a price you're comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and benefits. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects my flexibility, but it's also firm.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer shows some movement, it's still drastically higher than your budget.  There's no need to jump to John just yet, as you have room to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to approach a more realistic price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but I'm still struggling to see how your price aligns with my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go at this point."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but we're also setting a firm limit. This lets her know that while we're interested, we're also prepared to walk away if the price doesn't become more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect that.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but her price is still far too high. We need to signal that we're getting closer to our limit and may consider John's offer soon. We'll reject this offer to encourage more substantial movement on her part."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but we're still quite far apart. I need to see a price closer to my budget, otherwise I'll have to seriously consider my other options.  I'm willing to offer $750,000, but that's really pushing my limits."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're making a smaller increase this time to show Alice we're reaching the top of our budget. The message is direct about considering John's offer if she doesn't make a significant move. This creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the need for a more realistic price from her."
