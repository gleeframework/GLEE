Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging to build rapport. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being rigid, making it clear that I'm open to discussions. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that John is a backup option, allowing me to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can still potentially get a higher price from Bob. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $11,250 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Being friendly helps keep the negotiation productive.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  Mentioning ""fair price for both of us"" emphasizes a win-win situation.
* **Plan B in mind:**  I'm still aware of John's offer and won't settle for a price that's significantly lower."
