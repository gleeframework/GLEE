Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the potential benefit for Bob to emphasize the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process open.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a new offer. 
* If Bob accepts the offer, I'll finalize the transaction.
* If the negotiation stalls or becomes unfavorable, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, especially since he's interested in the product.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired amount but still lower than my minimum. This will show flexibility while staying firm on my value of the product. 
* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and my options to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This gives us both a good deal and allows the transaction to move forward. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value-oriented:** I'm reminding Bob that $13,500 is still a good deal for him, as it's lower than the product's value to him.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages a positive outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I'll proceed with the sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider making a final counteroffer, or I might move on to John if it seems unlikely to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
