Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""value and potential,"" you aim to justify the higher price, appealing to Bob's potential desire for a unique product. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters.  You can then decide if you want to go lower, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000."
