"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $115. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping to reach a compromise with Bob, but I'm not giving up on getting at least my minimum price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $120. There are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better price.  If I'm unable to, I can always sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```
