"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. How about $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:**  While low, $110 is still above Alice's value of the product ($120), so there's a chance she'll accept it if she's motivated to sell quickly. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is friendly and explains my position without being aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, as it's well below what you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice met me partway, $125 is still above her known value for the product.  I believe I can negotiate a slightly better price.
* **John is the Last Resort:** John's offer at $150 is my absolute ceiling.  I won't consider it unless I'm unable to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $117?"",
 ""product_price"": 117
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $117 splits the difference between her current offer ($125) and my last ($110). It shows I'm willing to negotiate fairly.
* **Close to Target:** This price is getting close to a good deal for me while still likely being profitable for Alice.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  The tone remains cordial and solution-oriented, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
