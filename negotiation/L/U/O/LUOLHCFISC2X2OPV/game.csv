"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This recognizes its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,800,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
