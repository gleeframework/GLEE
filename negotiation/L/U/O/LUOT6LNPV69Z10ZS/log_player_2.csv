"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's below the product's value to her, it's still not a good deal for you.  It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,300,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's still room for further negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of a better deal alive."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
