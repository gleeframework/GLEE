Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's also attractive to Bob as he's still getting a good deal compared to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is still a good deal, it's not as profitable as I'd like. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $12500. Can we make it work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's still significantly more than what John would pay, and it's closer to my target than the previous offers. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
