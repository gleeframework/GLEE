"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I appreciate the value you see in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still a little ways off. How about $750,000?  That's a fair offer considering the value and our respective positions.",750000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, as I mentioned earlier, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're still not comfortable, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I'm not willing to go lower than that. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,,
