Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I appreciate the value you see in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, as I mentioned earlier, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're still not comfortable, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I'm not willing to go lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower.  $825,000 is a reasonable compromise, saving you $175,000 off John's price and likely close to the best deal you can get from Alice."
