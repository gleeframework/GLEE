"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product,  which reflects its value to me and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $8,750 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
