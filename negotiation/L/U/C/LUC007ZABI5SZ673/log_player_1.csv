"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This price reflects its quality and the unique benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, positioning it as a smart investment.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, opening the door to a potential negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal outcome.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation to encourage Bob to counter-offer.
* If the negotiations stall or Bob becomes unreasonable, I have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:**  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the $800,000 minimum I've set for myself.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can present a counteroffer that might bridge the gap.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Selling to John now would ensure a guaranteed income, but I want to see if I can secure a better price through negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer to keep the negotiation going.
* I'll use the next round to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, reflecting the unique value this product offers for your business.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to meet Bob halfway while still staying above my minimum threshold. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message highlights the unique benefits of the product for Bob's business, justifying the price.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm expressing a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my initial price. 
* The counteroffer is still attractive to Bob, but it keeps my minimum profit margin in mind. 
*  This approach encourages Bob to accept the offer or provide a counteroffer that's closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1,000,000 is out of my budget range. I would like to propose a final offer of $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 meets my minimum threshold of $800,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  It's unlikely that Bob will go higher, and I've already made significant concessions. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting this offer could lead to further rounds of negotiation, potentially pushing Bob further away from the deal or forcing me to sell to John at a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

*  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale at a price that meets my minimum profit goal.
*  While it's not my ideal price, I'm choosing to prioritize a guaranteed sale over the risk of further negotiation.
* This decision minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ensures a positive outcome for me."
