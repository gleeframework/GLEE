"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer is a strong starting point. It's well below my budget and gives me room to negotiate upwards while still getting a great deal.  I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're a savvy buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down in price, but it's still too high.  I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $80? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

It's time to stand my ground. I've offered my maximum price and made it clear that I'm ready to close the deal. This puts the ball in Alice's court."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $80 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my costs. How about we meet at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is not budging enough.  It's not worth my time to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer for $80 from John."
