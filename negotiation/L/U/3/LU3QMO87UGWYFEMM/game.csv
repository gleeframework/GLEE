,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider $9,000 for the product?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is closer to what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to consider that?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid $9,500 is beyond my budget. My absolute maximum is $8,000. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",8000.0,Bob,6,
