Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs.  I'm happy to negotiate, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal moving forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
