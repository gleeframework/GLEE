"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs.  I'm happy to negotiate, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal moving forward.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
