"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I think that's a fair offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
