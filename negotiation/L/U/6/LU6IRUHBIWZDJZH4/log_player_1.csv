``` 
At this point, we are only 2 rounds away from the end of the negotiation, and Bob is not willing to go up much more. It's better to sell the product to John for $10,000, as it's closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept. There's a chance Bob may accept my counteroffer in the next round, but it's not worth the risk."
