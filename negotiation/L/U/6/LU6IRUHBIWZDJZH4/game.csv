"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the value I think the product is worth to me. Let me know what you think!",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,200, which still gives you a great deal. Let's find a middle ground. What do you say?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $11,200 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,900. I'm getting close to my target, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10900.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $10,900 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to drop to $11,100, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let's work together to find a solution that's fair for both of us.",11100.0,Alice,5,
