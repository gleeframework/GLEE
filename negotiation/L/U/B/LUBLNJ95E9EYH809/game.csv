"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you that I believe will be mutually beneficial. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects its true value and allows for a healthy profit for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is certainly lower than my initial offer, it's unfortunately not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about $1,050,000? This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us and is still significantly lower than what I'd receive from another buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue our discussion, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, which would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
