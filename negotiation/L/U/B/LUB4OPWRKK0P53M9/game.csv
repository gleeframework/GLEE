"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I do need to set a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, your offer is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price given the product's value to me and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while also considering its value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a deal. I can do $925,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product to both of us. What do you think, Bob?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $925,000 is closer to my target, I'm still only able to offer $900,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product within my budget while giving you a significant price for your asset.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be honest with you, $900,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I can do $915,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that we might be better off exploring other options. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
