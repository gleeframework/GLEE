"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely tempting, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,800? It's a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is a good compromise. It's lower than her original offer, and it's still within Bob's budget. The additional perks mentioned by Alice are also a bonus.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, accepting this offer is a good way to secure the product at a fair price without risking further negotiation."
