"I understand that you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,800? It's a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
