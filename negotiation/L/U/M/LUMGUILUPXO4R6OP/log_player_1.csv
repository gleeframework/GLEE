{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd be interested in. My asking price is $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $9,500 is a good starting point. It's close to my minimum value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone (""fantastic product"") helps build rapport.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering a price slightly lower than my minimum value shows I'm open to negotiation and increases the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum.  If his offers remain unacceptable, I'll likely choose to sell to John for $10,000 to guarantee my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $10,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than my initial offer, to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my minimum gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to show you I'm serious about selling it to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000. This shows I'm open to negotiation but still want to get a price closer to my minimum.
* **Maintain a Friendly Tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive and avoid pushing Bob away.
* **Highlighting Seriousness:**  I emphasize that I'm ""serious about selling it to you"" to make Bob feel valued and motivated to negotiate further. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects again, I'll consider a slightly lower counteroffer before ultimately choosing to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is still considerably lower than my minimum of $10,000.  
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  While he's moved slightly closer, there's only $250 difference between his offer and my previous counteroffer.  I don't want to keep going back and forth with small increments.
* **John Provides Safety Net:** With John ready to buy at my minimum, I have the luxury of not settling for a price significantly below my desired value.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a slightly lower price, maybe $8,900,  to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  If he doesn't budge, I'll happily sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $8,750 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Would you be willing to consider $8,900? I'm trying to be fair, and this would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $8,900, which is halfway between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's latest offer ($8,750). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I reiterate that this is a ""good deal for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Maintaining Friendly Tone:**  The message stays positive and friendly to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Last Stand:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell the product to John.  I'm trying to get as close to my minimum as possible, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I want, but I can still do a bit better. How about $8,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum, and he's not budging from his position. 
* **No Further Compromise:** I've already lowered my price significantly.  It's clear Bob is unwilling to pay closer to my minimum value. 
* **John Offers Certainty:** John's offer guarantees me my minimum, eliminating the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

**It's time to move on to a more certain sale with John and avoid the potential of further back-and-forth with Bob.**"
