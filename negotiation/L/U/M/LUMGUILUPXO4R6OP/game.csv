"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to show you I'm serious about selling it to you.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $8,750 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Would you be willing to consider $8,900? I'm trying to be fair, and this would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",8900.0,Alice,5,
