"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given the product's value to you and allows for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $887,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",915000.0,Alice,5,
