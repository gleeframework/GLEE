(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's my best shot at getting a deal. If Alice rejects, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget.  It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if I can push for a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my maximum budget and Alice's last offer. This is a compromise that hopefully shows I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal. If Alice rejects, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my limit.  I've already tried to negotiate a lower price twice, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go much lower.  To avoid further negotiation and to ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll buy it from John."
