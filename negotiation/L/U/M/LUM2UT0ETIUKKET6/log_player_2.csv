"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be valuable to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $119 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and the product's value doesn't outweigh the price difference for you, buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
