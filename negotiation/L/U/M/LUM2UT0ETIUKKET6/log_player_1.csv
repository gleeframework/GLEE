Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and potential ""deal"" for Bob. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and inviting Bob's input. This encourages a response and potential negotiation."
