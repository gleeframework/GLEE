"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $9000. Is there any way we can work something out closer to that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a price of $11000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still out of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $10000 for this product, and I hope you'll consider that offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and allows me to secure the product within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll meet you at $11500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
