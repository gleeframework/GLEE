Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price ($100) while also indicating a willingness to negotiate. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob is willing to pay close to $100, you'll get a good price.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  The message makes it clear you're open to discussion, which could lead to a compromise that benefits both parties. 

Remember, you can always go down to John's price of $80 if Bob isn't willing to meet you halfway."
