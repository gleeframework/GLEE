This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **You're close to your limit:** While you could try to haggle Alice down a little further, you're already below $900,000. Pushing too hard could make her walk away.
* **Time is running out:** You only have one round left after this. If you reject her offer and she doesn't come down significantly, you'll be forced to buy from John at the highest price.
* **It's a reasonable deal:**  You're getting the product for significantly less than your $1,200,000 maximum and well below John's price."
