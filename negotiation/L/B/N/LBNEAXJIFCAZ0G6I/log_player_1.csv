Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You want to get at least $100, and this offer ensures that.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants to, but it's still a good price for you. 

By starting with a slightly lower offer, you leave room for potential counteroffers and create an opportunity to reach a price that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm a bit tight on budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100.  You're better off rejecting Bob's offer and trying to negotiate a better price.  You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, giving Bob a chance to move closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's a middle ground:** It's exactly halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing you're willing to meet him halfway.
* **It's still above your minimum:** This ensures you're not selling the product for less than what it's worth to you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is truly tight on budget, there's still room to go down a little bit, but it shows you're serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can offer $95, and that's as high as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I really think I can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price point.  You've already made a compromise, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to go higher.  Selling to John for $100 is the best option to guarantee you make a profit without further negotiation."
