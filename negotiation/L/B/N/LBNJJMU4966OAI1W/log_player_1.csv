"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  We start with an ambitious offer significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing your hand. 
* **Openness to Discussion:** We signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. My counteroffer is $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Your Minimum:** Bob's counteroffer is $200,000 above your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Early Stage:** It's only round 2. Rejecting this offer doesn't significantly jeopardize the negotiation and shows Bob you're serious about getting a strong price. 
* **Maintain Momentum:** By countering, you maintain control of the negotiation and can try to steer Bob closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $1,400,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and make a concession to show flexibility. However, the concession is relatively small ($100,000) to maintain a strong position.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $1,500,000, we aim for a compromise that is still significantly above your minimum while potentially feeling like a ""win"" for Bob if he accepts.
* **Continued Justification:**  The message subtly reiterates the product's value to reinforce your stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. My counteroffer is $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:**  While not the ideal price, $1,450,000 is still a substantial $250,000 above your minimum. Accepting ensures a significant profit.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's incremental increases suggest he might be approaching his upper limit. Holding out for more could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows you to re-invest the earnings sooner.  

While holding out for a slightly higher price is tempting, the current offer represents a strong balance of profit and minimized risk."
