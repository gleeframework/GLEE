"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I believe that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
