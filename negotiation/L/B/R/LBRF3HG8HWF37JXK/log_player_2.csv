```

You've been negotiating for a while and you're not making much progress with Alice. You're getting closer to your target price, but it's taking more rounds than you'd like. John is offering a slightly higher price, but it's a sure thing, and you can avoid the risk of not being able to agree with Alice. Buying from John is the best option at this point."
