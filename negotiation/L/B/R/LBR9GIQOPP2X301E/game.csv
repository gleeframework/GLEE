"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $750000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $825000.  This reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but $825000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $775000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",775000.0,Bob,4,
