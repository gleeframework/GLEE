"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $850,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that price point be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 is still too far below what the product is worth to me. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
