Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that $500,000 profit margin as possible. Offering the product for exactly $1,000,000 leaves a lot of money on the table.  However, being too greedy might make Bob reject the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You emphasize the product's value and exclusivity to frame the negotiation positively.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 allows you to capture a significant portion ($350,000) of the potential profit margin while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value. 
* **No Room for Haggling (Optional):** You could consider making your offer firm, stating this is your best and final price to discourage extensive negotiation.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach.  You could adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how you assess Bob's negotiating style."
