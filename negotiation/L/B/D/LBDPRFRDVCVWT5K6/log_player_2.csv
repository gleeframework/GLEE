"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. There is still room for Alice to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is still profitable for Alice while also achieving a significant discount for himself.  Offering $11,000 represents a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer of $13,000 and leaves room for further negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good price.  There is still some room for negotiation, but continuing to haggle could risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
