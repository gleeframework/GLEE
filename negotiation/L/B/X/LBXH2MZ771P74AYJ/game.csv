"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is still a great deal, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is still a great deal, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
