"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its unique value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial counteroffer, but I want to see if we can get closer to my budget.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make another counteroffer and hopefully find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my limits, and I'm confident it would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11250. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my counteroffer of $11,250 that it's worth accepting.  It's a good compromise and allows me to purchase the product at a price that is within my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I'm confident this is a fair deal."
