"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $15000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer you $8000. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value of the product to me, I can offer it to you for $18000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While I appreciate the compromise, $18000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my initial counteroffer of $8000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $18000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering the value of the product to me, I can offer it to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
