"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is beneficial to Bob.**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This represents a $200,000 saving for Bob.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.** John's price of $1,200,000 is the full value Bob places on the product, meaning no savings.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it allows Bob to save money."
