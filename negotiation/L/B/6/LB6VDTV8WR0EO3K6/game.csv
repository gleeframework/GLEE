"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $100 for the product. Can we discuss a price around there?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we try to find a compromise at $70? That's a fair offer considering the value.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $90 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $80, but that's really the most I can offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you're interested.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close, Bob! However, I've already had an offer from another buyer who is willing to pay the full price of $80, so I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll meet you at $82.50, and that's my final offer.",82.5,Alice,7,
