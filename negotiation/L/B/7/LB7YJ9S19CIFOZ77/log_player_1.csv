Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Starting High:** A starting price of $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price. 

**Important:**  While aiming high is good, be prepared to negotiate if Bob shows resistance. You can always lower the price slightly to secure a deal, as long as it remains above your $10,000 baseline."
