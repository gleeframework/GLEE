{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $18,000 is way over his budget of $10,000. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, which is $10,000. This is his maximum budget and the price John is willing to sell at.  There's no point in starting the negotiation at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely get it for even lower. He should keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer from $10,000 but still staying below Alice's offer of $16,000. This shows he's willing to negotiate but also has a firm limit."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product, and he knows that he can buy it from John for that price. He should keep negotiating with Alice to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of finding a middle ground. He's increasing his offer again, showing willingness to compromise, but staying firmly within his budget. This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's current price, giving her room to negotiate down without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, even if it's closer than before.  Bob is determined to get the price down to his limit.  He has three rounds left and should keep negotiating to try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price point, showing his willingness to compromise. He is still under her offer and  within his budget, making it a reasonable counteroffer. This might encourage Alice to accept a deal closer to his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still too high for Bob. He only has one round left and is unlikely to get a better price from Alice. Since John is willing to sell for $10,000, it's the most logical and financially sound decision for Bob to buy the product from John.  He saves $5,000 compared to accepting Alice's final offer."
