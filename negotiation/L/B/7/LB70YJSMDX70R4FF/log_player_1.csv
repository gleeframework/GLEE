Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a little high for me, though. I'm thinking something closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still finding it hard to meet that price.  How about we settle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000

We're still below John's offer, and we have room to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if Bob will go higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. While $760,000 is closer, I'm proposing $800,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Holds Firm:**  It signals that I'm not willing to go below my baseline (John's offer).
* **Shows Compromise:** The movement from $825,000 to $800,000 demonstrates flexibility.
* **Justifies the Price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob."
