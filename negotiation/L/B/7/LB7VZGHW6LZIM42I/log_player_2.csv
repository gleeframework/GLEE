"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product seems great, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still slightly above Bob's preferred price point, but it's within his budget of $12,000 and represents a compromise. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but there's a risk Alice might become less flexible or even walk away from the deal. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget and avoids the potential for a deal to fall through."
