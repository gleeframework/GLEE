"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than Alice's valuation, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should reject this offer and aim for the better deal."
