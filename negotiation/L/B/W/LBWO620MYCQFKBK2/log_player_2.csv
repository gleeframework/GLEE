# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this [product name] that you expressed interest in. I'm offering it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm not interested in paying more than I need to. Since I can get the product from John for $120, which is less than Alice's offer, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
