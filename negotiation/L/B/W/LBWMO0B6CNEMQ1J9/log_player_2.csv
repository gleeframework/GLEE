Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider the minimum value I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.

```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I'm willing to meet you at $830,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer within the range we've discussed. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has made it clear that $820,000 is her final offer.  Bob has limited rounds remaining, and it's not certain that Alice will budge further. To ensure Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation, it's best to buy from John at $800,000."
