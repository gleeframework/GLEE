Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the offer of $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To be frank, I have another buyer ready at a much higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that could be you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a firm budget in mind.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential value to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but I'm starting to feel like we're too far apart on this.  My other buyer is ready to move forward, and honestly, $1,500,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  I'm giving you the chance to match this before I finalize the deal with them.  Consider this my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, she's still well above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Her ""final offer"" tactics and mention of another buyer are likely negotiation strategies.  You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, making it the safest and most financially sound choice at this point."
