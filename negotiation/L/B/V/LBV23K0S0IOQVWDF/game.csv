"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the offer of $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To be frank, I have another buyer ready at a much higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that could be you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a firm budget in mind.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but I'm starting to feel like we're too far apart on this.  My other buyer is ready to move forward, and honestly, $1,500,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  I'm giving you the chance to match this before I finalize the deal with them.  Consider this my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
