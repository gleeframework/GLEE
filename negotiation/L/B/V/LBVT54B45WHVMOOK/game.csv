"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. To start the negotiation, I propose a price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 doesn't reflect that. Let's meet closer to the middle ground. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  To show I'm flexible, I'll come down slightly. How about $1,312,500?",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,312,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000, which is the same price I offered in round 4. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
