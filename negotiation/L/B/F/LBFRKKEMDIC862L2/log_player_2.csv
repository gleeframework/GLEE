"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* $90 is still more than your maximum value for the product ($100).
* It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's value for the product ($80), but still within my budget. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also signals that I'm serious about buying the product. 
*  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $87, which is within my budget and a good deal for me.
*  Continuing to negotiate could result in further price reductions, but it also risks the deal falling apart.  
* Buying from John for $100 is not as good of a deal as accepting Alice's offer.
*  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product for a fair price without wasting time on further negotiation."
