Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price.  I have 9 more rounds to close a deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $1,100,000 is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Bob's offer.  $1,050,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I've already lost a few rounds and I want to close this deal."
