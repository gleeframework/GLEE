Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves a good profit margin for Bob. It also opens the door for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still above my minimum of $800,000, and it's a good deal for me considering the potential for further negotiation.  It's a good move to accept and secure the sale."
