"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay up to $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
