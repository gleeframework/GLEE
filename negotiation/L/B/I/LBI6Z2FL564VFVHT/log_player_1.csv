Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  I believe this is a fair offer reflecting a significant investment on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this adjusted price point represents a fair compromise, allowing you to reap substantial benefits from this unique opportunity."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but we need to find a middle ground.  $1,100,000 is still significantly more than I'm prepared to spend.  How about we settle on $700,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating interest. We're still in early rounds and can afford to negotiate.  We'll aim to push closer to our minimum while gauging his reactions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's immense value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still pushing my budget.  To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option for $800,000.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 to secure the deal with you instead. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has revealed his alternative option is $800,000 and is unlikely to go higher. He's framed this as his final offer. Accepting his offer nets us less than selling to John.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
