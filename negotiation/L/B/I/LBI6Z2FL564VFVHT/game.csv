"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns for you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  I believe this is a fair offer reflecting a significant investment on my part.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this adjusted price point represents a fair compromise, allowing you to reap substantial benefits from this unique opportunity.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but we need to find a middle ground.  $1,100,000 is still significantly more than I'm prepared to spend.  How about we settle on $700,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's immense value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still pushing my budget.  To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option for $800,000.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 to secure the deal with you instead. This is my final offer.",750000.0,Bob,6,
