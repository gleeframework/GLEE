Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,900,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and there's room to push for a better price.  We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle while keeping John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $2,000,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,900,000) and our previous ask ($2,100,000). It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming high.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating it's our final offer, we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Backup Plan:** We're still above John's offer ($1,500,000), so we have a safety net if Bob walks away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,950,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield marginal gains and risks Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and secures a good price."
