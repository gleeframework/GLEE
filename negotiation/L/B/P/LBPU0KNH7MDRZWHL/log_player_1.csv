"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, demonstrating your confidence in the value of the product while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate, but still above your minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and the risk of further negotiation leading to a worse deal is increasing.  Selling to John at this point guarantees a safe and reasonable profit, preventing further potential losses."
