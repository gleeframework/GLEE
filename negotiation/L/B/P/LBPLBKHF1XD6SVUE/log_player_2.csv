Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price as well. Let's make this happen!

You're still $1,000 above your ideal price, and there's room for Alice to come down a bit more.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can bridge the gap."
