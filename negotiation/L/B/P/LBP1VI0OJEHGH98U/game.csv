"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can secure it for a lower price elsewhere. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for your product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a chance for you to get a great product at a competitive price.  Let's make this happen.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still interested in purchasing your product, but I am unable to meet the price of $110. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $105 for your product.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to find common ground here.  I'm not willing to go lower than $108. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let me know if you're serious about making a deal.",108.0,Alice,5,
