{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum price of $10,000.  Although I am willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable going lower than $8,500.  It's a good opportunity to sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
