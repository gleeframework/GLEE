Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

This price is fair, aligns with the product's true worth, and represents a reasonable compromise.  I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
