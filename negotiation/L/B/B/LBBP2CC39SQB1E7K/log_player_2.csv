"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to explore a counteroffer that might bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own minimum price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $1,200,000 and allows him to save a significant amount compared to buying from John. While there's always a chance to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal."
