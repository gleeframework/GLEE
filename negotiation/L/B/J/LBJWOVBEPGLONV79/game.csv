"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering $825,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to compromise.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000 to reflect the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $912,500. This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the value of the product, but $912,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,
