"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This still gives you a good deal considering your value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but  $11,250 is the lowest I can go. If you're serious about buying this, I think this price is fair, considering your value for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
