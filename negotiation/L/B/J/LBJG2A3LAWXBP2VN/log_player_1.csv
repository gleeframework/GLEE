Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving it away for less than your minimum value.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** There's room for negotiation, increasing the chance of a deal.
* **It shows confidence:** By setting a price above $100, you're showing Bob that the product is valuable.

This strategy allows you to potentially earn more than $100 while keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired minimum of $100. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your target while keeping the potential for a better deal with Bob alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows that you are willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintain Value:** The price is still above your minimum of $100.
* **Positive Language:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob. 

This strategy aims to find a price that is acceptable to both parties while maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about $108?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $108 is very close to your minimum of $100, and it's higher than John's offer of $100.  Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate."
