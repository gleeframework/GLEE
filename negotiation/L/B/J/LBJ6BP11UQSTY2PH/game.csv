"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",107.5,Bob,4,
