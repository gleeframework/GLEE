"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm also highlighting the product's value to him and emphasizing my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but my budget is limited. I'd like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  While $15,000 is my floor, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $18,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $15,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility while still trying to get a good deal. I'm also reminding Bob that this is a considerable reduction from my original offer.  This tactic puts pressure on him to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my floor price, and I've already rejected his offer twice.  I'm running the risk of losing this deal and being forced to sell to John for the same amount.  It's better to close the deal now and secure a sale."
