Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100, Bob. That's below my minimum price. I can see you're really interested, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, her offers are still significantly higher than our alternative option. We know we can get the product for $100 from John, and there's no guarantee Alice will go that low.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
