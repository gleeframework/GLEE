Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $105, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  

Alice is unlikely to go below $105. You've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of Alice not budging. You can secure the product for your target price of $100 by going with John."
