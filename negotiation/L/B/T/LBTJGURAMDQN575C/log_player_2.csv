"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $6,500?"", 
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,500) than Alice's initial price ($9,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a smooth negotiation. 
* **Aiming for Under $8,000:**  My goal is to pay less than what John is offering ($8,000). This counteroffer gives me a good buffer to potentially negotiate upwards while still staying below my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we're still not quite there. There's a chance we can negotiate her down further to get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $8,200 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $7,500?"", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between her last offer ($8,200) and my previous offer ($6,500). 
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  This offer keeps me safely below my $8,000 limit, ensuring I'm getting a better deal than John's offer. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** By making another counteroffer, I show Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matched John's Price:** Alice has met my bottom line by matching John's price of $8,000. 
* **No Guarantee of a Lower Price:**  Continuing to negotiate might irritate Alice, and there's no guarantee she'll go any lower. It's unlikely she'll go much lower considering her product's value to her.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy further negotiation rounds. 

While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. Alice's offer is a fair one at this point."
