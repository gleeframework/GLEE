Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000.  
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 aims to maximize potential profit. While it's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, there's a chance he might be willing to negotiate down from that point.
* **Backup Plan (John):** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, providing a safety net. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have some time to negotiate with Bob. If you need to sell the product quickly, a price closer to $15,000 might be more reasonable."
