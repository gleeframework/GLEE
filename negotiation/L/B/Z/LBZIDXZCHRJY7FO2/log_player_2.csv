{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering a deal with me. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to lower the price to $100. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $93.12 is closer, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. How about we settle on $91?  It's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 91}
