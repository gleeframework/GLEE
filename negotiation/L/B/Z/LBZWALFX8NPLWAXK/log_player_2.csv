Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider a lower price closer to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $10,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice didn't meet my ideal price of $10,000, she's come down to $11,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk her raising the price again or the negotiation falling apart."
