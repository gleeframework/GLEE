Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start high.  
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer helps you assess Bob's enthusiasm. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high price leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer."
