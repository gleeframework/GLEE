{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, considering its potential value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's valuation allows for potential negotiation while still remaining significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer provides leverage. While you don't want to mention John directly, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 gives you confidence in setting a higher price for Bob."
