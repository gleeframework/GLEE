Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you don't want to accept anything less than that from Bob. 
* **Starting high:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Potential for profit:** By offering the product at $19,000, there's a chance Bob might accept, giving you a $4,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.

**Important Note:**  While this is a starting point, be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he seems hesitant, you might consider a slightly lower offer to secure the sale."
