"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's significantly less than what I could get from someone else, and still gives you a nice profit margin. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While Alice's offer is less than her product's worth, it's still significantly more than what John is offering. Rejecting this offer opens the door for a better deal, potentially from Alice or by going with John's offer."
