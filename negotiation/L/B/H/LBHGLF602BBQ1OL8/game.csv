"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my willingness to strike a deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can offer $900,000. I need to be mindful of my spending, and this is a firm offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but my position hasn't changed - this product holds significant value.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,750,000.  This offer reflects my willingness to close this deal.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still pushing my limit.  My best offer is $1,000,000.  This is all I'm willing to spend. If we can make it work, great, otherwise, I need to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
