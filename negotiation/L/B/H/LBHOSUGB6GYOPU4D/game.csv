"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $900000 for the product. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $900000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with a price of $1100000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your new offer, so I'll counter with a price of $1050000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with a price of $1080000. I believe this is the best compromise considering the product's value to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept $1040000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with a price of $1060000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",1060000.0,Alice,7,

I'm not willing to go any higher than $1000000. This is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.,1000000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're firm on $1000000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
