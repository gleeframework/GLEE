Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $150, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price, netting me a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below my guaranteed sale price allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, or accept outright.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price significantly lower than my minimum to John might make Bob suspicious of the product's value."
