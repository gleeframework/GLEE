"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $12,800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",12800.0,Alice,5,
