Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, and this starting point gives me some room to negotiate down to my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to get the absolute maximum profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
