,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's unique qualities. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair offer reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value you place on the product, $1,250,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000,  which is a significant step closer to your offer. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is a very competitive offer, given the market for such a unique product.  I'm confident this is a price that benefits us both.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
