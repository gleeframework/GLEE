"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,200,000 is still too far below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  I'm confident this price is attractive and we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're on a budget, but $1,250,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but only to $1,350,000.  This represents a significant discount for you and a fair profit for me. Let's close this deal and get you the product you need.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000, so I'm offering $1,300,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
