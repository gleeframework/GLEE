Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
