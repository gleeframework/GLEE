"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're already at your maximum price point with John. There's no reason to engage in negotiation with Alice, as the best possible outcome is the same price as John's offer.  It's safer to go with the guaranteed price from John."
