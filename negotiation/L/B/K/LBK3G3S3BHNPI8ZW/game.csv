"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13500.  It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $10000 to me, and I know it's worth even more to you.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about $12500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more comfortable with the price. How about $11500? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $12000 is my final offer.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $11000. I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise.  How about $11500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $10800. I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me here.",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10800 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to meet you in the middle, how about $11200?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would ensure we both get a good deal.",11200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the negotiation. I'm willing to make one last offer of $10500. If you can't meet me here, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John.",10500.0,Bob,10,
