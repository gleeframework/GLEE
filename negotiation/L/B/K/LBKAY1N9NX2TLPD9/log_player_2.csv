"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $115 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110. While I'd still prefer to get it for $105, this offer is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $100. It's a better compromise and allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget."
