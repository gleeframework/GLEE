Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $115 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than his initial valuation of $100, I can still do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
