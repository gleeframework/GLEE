"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $115 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
