"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,100,000 is still too high.  There is room for negotiation to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns. Would you consider $1,050,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,050,000 is lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay and what he believes the product is truly worth. There's still room to negotiate further, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
