"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still just a little over budget.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above John's offer and have room to negotiate. Bob's message also indicates he's quite eager to make the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this right now at $10,900?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and I'd like to see us close the deal."", 
""product_price"": 10900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** We're coming down slightly from our previous offer to show Bob we're still negotiating and willing to find a middle ground. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting we ""settle this right now,"" we're subtly introducing a time pressure element, which might encourage Bob to agree rather than risk further negotiation. 
* **Positive Language:** We continue to emphasize the product's value and our desire to close the deal, fostering goodwill."
