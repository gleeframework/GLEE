"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal in subsequent rounds."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Reasonable Value:** $12,000 is still within Bob's budget and a reasonable price, considering Alice's valuation of $10,000.
* **Sets the Stage:** This counteroffer establishes a lower price point for the negotiation, putting pressure on Alice to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13000? I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, there's still room to negotiate further. Bob has already shown he's willing to walk away, so rejecting this offer could put more pressure on Alice to come down in price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500? It's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob acknowledges Alice's previous rejection and offers a compromise that shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **Small Increment:**  The offer is only $500 more than Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to close the gap.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  The counteroffer still keeps the price lower than Alice's desired price, putting pressure on her to accept."

Round 5

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's target, there's still room to negotiate.  Bob has already shown he's willing to walk away and has a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, Bob can try to push for a lower price in the remaining rounds."
