"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know the product is worth even more to you. This price is very fair, considering its value to both of us. Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $100,000** compared to buying from John.
* Even though Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, it's still a better deal than buying from John."
