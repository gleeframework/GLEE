"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned the product holds.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  my original price takes into account the significant potential this product holds. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, but still allows me to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
