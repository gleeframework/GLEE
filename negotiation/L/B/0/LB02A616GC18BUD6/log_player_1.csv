Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum price.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
