Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects my offer. However, it's still a good starting point as it's not too far off from his value, making the offer more likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is still below my ideal price of $90 but closer to my minimum value of $80. This keeps the negotiation going while giving Bob a better price than his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value of $80.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking the sale for a small increase in price. I'm accepting his offer and moving on."
