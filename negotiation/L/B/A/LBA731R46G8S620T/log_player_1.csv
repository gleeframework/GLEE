Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him ($12,000), but lower than what I could get from John ($15,000). 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I'll make a profit of $2,000. 
* **Minimize risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John and make a profit of $3,000. 

By offering a price slightly lower than John's offer, I'm incentivizing Bob to accept the deal, while still securing a good profit for myself."
