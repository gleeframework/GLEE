"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the potential it holds for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to achieve significant gains. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
