"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible but $9,750 is still too low.  I'm happy to meet you at $10,250.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see the product. Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,5,
