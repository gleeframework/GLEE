Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that the product is worth at least $80 to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob. This aims to build a positive atmosphere and encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation.

**Strategy:** By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to maximize my potential profit while also staying open to a fair deal."
