``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price. I've included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I'm confident I can get at least $8,000, so I'm not in a hurry to sell to John yet."
