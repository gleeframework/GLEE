"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is substantial, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
