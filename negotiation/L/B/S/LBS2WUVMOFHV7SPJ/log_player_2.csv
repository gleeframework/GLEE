**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but not ideal.** Alice's price is $50,000 less than John's, which is a decent savings.
* **You have room to negotiate.** Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, you can try to get Alice to lower her price further. 
* **Rejecting the offer creates leverage.** By rejecting, you demonstrate that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away. This puts pressure on Alice to improve her offer to secure the deal."
