Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
