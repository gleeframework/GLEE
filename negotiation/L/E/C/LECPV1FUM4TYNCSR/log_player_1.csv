"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, but still below my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob initially offered, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come up with a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, his offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm making another small concession, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to meet halfway with Bob's last offer to get a deal done before I run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly what the product is worth to him. I'm not going to get a better price from him, and I've already lost some time with the back and forth.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a much better price."
