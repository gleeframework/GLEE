"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  While I can't disclose the details publicly, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,500,000 to the right buyer.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This represents a significant savings for you, and allows me to secure a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is below your maximum budget of $1,500,000.** This makes it a potentially good deal.
* **Alice's offer is above her minimum selling price of $1,000,000.** This means she is willing to negotiate and likely wants to make the sale.
* **Buying from John would cost you more.**  While you're not guaranteed a better price from John in the future, Alice's offer is already good enough to save you money. 

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $250,000 compared to buying from John."
