Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

This offer is strategically priced. Here's why:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so a price of $11,000 is still a good deal for him, as he's getting it for less than what it's worth to him.
* **It's lower than your ""fallback"" price:** Your fallback price with John is $12,000. By offering $11,000, you're still making a profit, but you're giving Bob an incentive to accept the deal.

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, as he's getting a discount compared to its perceived value.  At the same time, you're still maximizing your profits by not selling it for the lowest possible price."
