"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your valuation and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $900,000 for the product. This reflects a midpoint between our initial proposal and your revised offer, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  I'm firm on my offer of $850,000, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties.",850000.0,Bob,4,
