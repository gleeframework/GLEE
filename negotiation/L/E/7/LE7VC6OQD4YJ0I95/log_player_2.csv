# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $119 is close to your $100 limit, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off saving the $19 and going with John."
