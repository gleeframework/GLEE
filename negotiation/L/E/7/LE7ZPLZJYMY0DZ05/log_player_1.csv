{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but also leaves me with some profit margin.  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, especially considering I have a guaranteed offer from John for that price.  I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a good offer, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that is acceptable to me."
