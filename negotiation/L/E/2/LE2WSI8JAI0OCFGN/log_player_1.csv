""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you're interested in, for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but there's a good chance he'll accept a price slightly lower than his maximum. 
* **Secure a Deal:** Offering a price too close to $10,000 risks a rejection, forcing a sale to John at $8,000. This offer balances risk and potential reward."
