"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value and hopefully more enticing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 less than what I would get from John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's still a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
