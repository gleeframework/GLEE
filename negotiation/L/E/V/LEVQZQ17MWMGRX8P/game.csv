"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Is that something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $130? Would you be willing to go up to that price?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
