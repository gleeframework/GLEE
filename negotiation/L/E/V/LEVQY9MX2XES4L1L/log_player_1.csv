Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  Remember, I have John as a backup buyer. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm prepared to negotiate or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While I'm happy that Bob is interested, $9,000 is below my minimum price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price, so I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a Fallback:**  If this negotiation doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I at least meet my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving away the farm. I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and continuing to counteroffer may lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob.
* **John is a Backup:**  While I'm not getting my ideal price, selling to Bob for $9,800 is better than selling to John for $10,000. I'm confident I can find other buyers in the future who might be willing to pay closer to my initial asking price."
