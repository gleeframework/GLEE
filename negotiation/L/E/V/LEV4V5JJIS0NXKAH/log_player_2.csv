{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is $13,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $12000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but it's still above your desired price point of $12,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate as you're still within your budget and there's room for further compromise."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $13,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about buying this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to compromise at $14000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $14,000, which is only $1,000 less than what John is selling it for.  At this point, the potential savings by continuing to negotiate are minimal, and it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer.  It's better to buy from John for $15,000 to ensure you get the product without further delay."
