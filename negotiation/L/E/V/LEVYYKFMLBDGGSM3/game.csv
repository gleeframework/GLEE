"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000. I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to offer $725,000.  If this works, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",725000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $775,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make one last offer: $762,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",762500.0,Alice,7,
