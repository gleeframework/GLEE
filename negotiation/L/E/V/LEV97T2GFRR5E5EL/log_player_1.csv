"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to accept Bob's low offer.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling below $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with in the long run. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, this time between $975,000 and $1,025,000. How about $1,000,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay. It's also the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a good deal for me, considering John would only pay $1,200,000.  Let's seal the deal."
