Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $17,000 is still too far from what I can afford.  Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  That's getting closer to a price I can afford.  Could you do $11,000?  That would allow me to accept and close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly far apart, and Bob is moving slowly. It's time to show firmness and push Bob to make a more substantial move or consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our prices is still substantial.  My final offer is $14,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's value. Let me know your decision."",
 ""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time Constraint:** We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and we need to push Bob to a decision.
* **Firmness:** By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're not willing to go much lower.
* **Alternative:** We still have John as a backup option, ensuring we don't feel pressured to accept a deal significantly below our minimum."
