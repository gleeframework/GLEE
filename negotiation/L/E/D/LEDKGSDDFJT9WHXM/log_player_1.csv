Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?

Round 3

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers a lot of value, and I think a fair price would be closer to $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers.  How about $12,750?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
