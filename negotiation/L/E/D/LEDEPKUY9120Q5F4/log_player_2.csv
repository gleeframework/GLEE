"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. The goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the initial offer keeps that option open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. He's offering $13,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $14,500, which is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. While a lower price would be preferable, accepting this offer is the most rational choice. 

* **Rejecting and making another counteroffer:** There's a risk that Alice might reject the counteroffer again, leading to further back-and-forth negotiations.  This could potentially result in Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Buying from John:**  This would cost Bob $15,000, which is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $14,500 is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product within his budget while minimizing risk."
