"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price point. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can explore what Alice's bottom line is before committing."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm willing to accept $950,000 for the product. This would allow me to recoup some of my initial investment and still give you a great deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is within your budget and is a good deal considering your maximum is $1,000,000. Accepting the offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
