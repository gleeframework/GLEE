Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
