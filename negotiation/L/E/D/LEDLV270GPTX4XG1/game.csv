"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about this product, and I'm prepared to pay $950000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
