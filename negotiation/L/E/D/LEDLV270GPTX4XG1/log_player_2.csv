"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's closer to his ideal price, it's worth trying to negotiate further or buy from John.  Bob can potentially save more by continuing the negotiation or securing the product from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating:**  This could potentially result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and further negotiations could be time-consuming.
2. **Buy from John:** This is the most secure option.  It guarantees Bob gets the product at his maximum budget, saving him time and potential stress of further negotiations. 

Considering the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of a good price with John, Bob should choose to buy from John."
