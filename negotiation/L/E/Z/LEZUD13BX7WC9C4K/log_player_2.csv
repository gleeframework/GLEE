"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $125. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify paying around $50 for it."",
""product_price"": 50
}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it's within a reasonable negotiation range. It leaves room for Alice to counter and you to potentially meet in the middle. Starting low also emphasizes your budget constraints and puts the pressure on Alice to justify her pricing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $50 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to your range, but $90 is still a significant markup from John's price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Acknowledges Alice's compromise:** You want to maintain a positive negotiation tone.
* **Proposes a specific solution:**  ""Meeting in the middle"" sounds fair and gives a concrete target.
* **Stays below your maximum but above John's price:** This gives you some wiggle room if Alice pushes back."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, $70 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $85? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably and is now only offering the product for $5 more than John.  While you could try to haggle further, there's a risk Alice might refuse and you'd end up paying $80 anyway. This offer represents a good balance of savings and minimizing risk."
