Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $125. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential value he gets. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, which I'm prepared to handle. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 allows me to be more assertive in negotiation. If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify paying around $50 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, it shows he's still interested. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my target.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150, guaranteeing I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $50 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial $125 price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he gets at this price.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** $90 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer of $50 and allows me to make a profit. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I leave the door open for further discussion, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $70 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer than previous offers, accepting would result in a substantial financial loss.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, suggesting there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue this negotiation.
* **John Provides Security:**  I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer. 

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target, while keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, $70 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $85? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (But Not Too Far):** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($70), showing continued willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob, highlighting the benefit he gets at this price.
* **Profit Margin:** $85 allows me to make a profit while still being considerably higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is enthusiastic and encourages Bob to finalize the deal.

This counteroffer aims to:
* Maintain my negotiating position while showing flexibility.
* Increase the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* Encourage Bob to accept the offer."
