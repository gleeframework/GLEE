"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll make a great decision. Here's my initial offer: $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of reason. It shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to overpay. This will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's open to a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is: $800,000 is the minimum I can do, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount. I'll sell it to you for $795,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $795,000 is within my budget and is a significant decrease from her initial offer. While I would prefer to pay even less, it's likely that further negotiations will be difficult and time-consuming. This offer is a good deal, and accepting it saves me time and potentially more money in the long run."
