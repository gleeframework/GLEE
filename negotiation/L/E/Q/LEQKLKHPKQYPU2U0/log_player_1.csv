Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate. This gives me room to potentially make a profit and also allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Since my minimum acceptable price is $80, and Bob is offering exactly that, I will accept his offer. It's not ideal, but it ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing the deal to John."
