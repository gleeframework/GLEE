Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go up to $8,200. That's the best I can do. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200, and I can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate for a potential savings of $200."
