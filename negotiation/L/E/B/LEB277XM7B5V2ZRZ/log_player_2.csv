Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer is within my budget and represents a good compromise. While I would prefer a lower price, it's likely I won't get a better deal, especially if I consider the risk of John raising his price if I try to buy from him later."
