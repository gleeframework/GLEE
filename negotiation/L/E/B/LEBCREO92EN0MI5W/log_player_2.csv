"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe is of immense value to you, and I'm confident it can help you achieve your goals. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000, which I know is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is starting at her maximum price. There's no reason to accept her offer outright since you have the option to buy from John at the same price. By rejecting, you give yourself an opportunity to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
