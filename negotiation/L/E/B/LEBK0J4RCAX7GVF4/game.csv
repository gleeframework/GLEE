,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in your product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? ",130.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,135.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. How about $135 is as low as I can go?",135.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",132.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,137.0
"I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still willing to work with you. How about $137 is the best I can do?",137.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm getting closer to my limit, but $137 is still a bit too much.  Let's split the difference and go with $134. This seems fair to both of us.",134.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,138.0
"I'm not sure we're getting any closer to a deal at this rate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $138 is the final offer?",138.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $138 is still pushing my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $136? It's fair for both of us and we can finalize this.",136.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,139.0
"I'm not getting any younger, and I'm starting to think this deal is going nowhere. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $139. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",139.0,Alice,9,,
