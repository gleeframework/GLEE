"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's value and wouldn't be a fair deal for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,000,000? This price still allows for a profit for me while remaining within a reasonable range for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
