Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's value and wouldn't be a fair deal for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,000,000? This price still allows for a profit for me while remaining within a reasonable range for you.
