"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $800000.  This would allow me to confidently invest in the product and see a greater return on my investment.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $837500. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the investment while ensuring you still get a good deal.",837500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $837500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
