"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've developed with great care and I know it would be a perfect fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a very special opportunity, as I'm only willing to sell this product to one buyer. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at a price that is less beneficial to me. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
