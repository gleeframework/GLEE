"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm initially offering it for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is offering our minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee we can negotiate him higher in the remaining rounds, and waiting carries the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting the sure $12,000 is the best move.
