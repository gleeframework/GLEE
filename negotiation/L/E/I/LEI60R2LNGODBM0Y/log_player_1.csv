"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll try to get a good price for myself. I'll offer him the product at $120.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since I have the option to sell the product to John for $100, I'll think carefully about it.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to my target price of $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 110}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was $90, and my initial offer was $120, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his initial offer, but still lower than my initial offer.
