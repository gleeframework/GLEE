"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $90 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100, which is the maximum I can afford. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
