"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something that I'm confident would bring significant benefit to your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the return will be well worth it. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,
