Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to my business; however, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While his offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to give him another chance, but I will need to counter with a price that is closer to my initial offer."

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While he's come up a bit, it's still far below what I need to consider.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not willing to drop too much further.  If we can't reach a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds, I will sell to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement on price.  To be honest, I'm getting close to walking away and going with a different vendor at this point.  My absolute best and final offer is $1,450,000.  If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with the other vendor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Bob's final offer is still below my desired price. However, I'm not ready to walk away just yet. I will counter with a price closer to his offer.  I'm feeling confident that we can come to an agreement in the next few rounds. If not, I can always sell to John."
