"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $90 is a bit outside of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer who's willing to pay your asking price.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $80, which is my minimum price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. If you're still not satisfied, I can explore other options. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
