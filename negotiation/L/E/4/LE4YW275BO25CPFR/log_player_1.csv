{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a bit more than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This way I can potentially get a higher price, but still have a chance of securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $95 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  I'm confident you'll still find this a great value."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $97.50 as a compromise. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a better deal by continuing to negotiate with him."
