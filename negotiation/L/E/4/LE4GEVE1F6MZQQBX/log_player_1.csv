""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us.  It makes more sense to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however,  $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum. It's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your perspective."",
""product_price"": 1025000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling like we're getting closer. To show you I'm serious, I'll bump my offer to $1,000,000 even. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob has met my absolute minimum price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price, and waiting carries the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away. It's time to close the deal."
