"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm confident you'll find highly useful. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to make a profit as well. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still higher than what you could buy it from John for. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer at a lower price, closer to her $8,000 valuation."
