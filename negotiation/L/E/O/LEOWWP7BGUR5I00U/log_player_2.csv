"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, I believe it would greatly benefit you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget:**  $1,200,000 exceeds your maximum of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  You can aim for a lower price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer as a fallback option gives you leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still represents a significant investment for me. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value it brings to my business."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to invest in our product. To better accommodate your budget while still ensuring a fair transaction, I propose a revised price of $1,050,000 for the product. This still reflects its high value and potential return on investment for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget:** $1,050,000 is more than your maximum of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer is now the better deal:**  Since John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous to go with him at this point. 
* **Negotiation risks:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to more counteroffers and potentially more time wasted without a guaranteed outcome within your budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. As I stated before, I'm only able to offer $900,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your budget constraints. In an effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am prepared to offer the product at a price of $1,020,000. This still maintains a fair valuation of the product while allowing for a more manageable investment for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above budget:**  While it's closer to your limit, $1,020,000 is still higher than your $1,000,000 maximum.
* **John's offer guarantees the best deal:** You've already established that John is willing to sell for your maximum price.
* **No guarantee of further concessions:** There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and you're already past the halfway point in the negotiations. 

By buying from John, you secure the product at your desired price and avoid further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
