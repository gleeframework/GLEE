Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's potential for him to accept or counteroffer.
* **It shows you're serious:** A high initial offer demonstrates that you're not desperate for a sale and you believe in the product's value. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's right at my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, but still maintains a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather sell to John at this point and guarantee a $1,000,000 profit.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a secure sale."
