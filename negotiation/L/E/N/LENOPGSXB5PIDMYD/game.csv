"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $900,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This still represents a good deal for you, and it allows me to keep the product in the market. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? That's the highest I can go.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. That's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
