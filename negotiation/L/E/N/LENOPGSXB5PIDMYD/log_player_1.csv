{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I aim for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **John as Safety Net:** The offer is still within my comfort zone knowing John is ready to pay my minimum. 

This strategy balances maximizing my earnings with the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have room to negotiate further.  I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  My safety net with John is still in place, ensuring I won't settle for a price that's too low. 

**Next Move:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $900,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This still represents a good deal for you, and it allows me to keep the product in the market. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price closer to my initial target.
* **Appeal to Value:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Market Awareness:** I imply that the product is still in demand, adding a sense of urgency to his decision.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to bridge the gap between our respective positions and potentially secure a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm not willing to accept a price that's too far below my target.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I still have room to negotiate further. I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer, especially since Bob has indicated a willingness to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer:** My safety net with John is still in place, providing me with a reliable backup option if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Move:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my previous offer of $1,050,000. I might even try a slightly higher price, considering Bob's willingness to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. That's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise by lowering the price slightly from my previous offer, making it appear more reasonable.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product, reinforcing the benefits of the deal for Bob.
* **Appeal to Partnership:** I emphasize a ""solution that works for both of us,"" fostering a sense of partnership and collaboration.

This counteroffer aims to close the gap between our positions while still maintaining a price that's closer to my target. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept and avoid needing to rely on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but no higher. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, his latest offer of $925,000 is still significantly below my minimum target of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** The gap between our desired prices is getting increasingly smaller. Further negotiation might not lead to a significant improvement, and I'm not willing to risk losing a better deal with John.
* **John's Offer:**  My safety net with John guarantees a price that meets my minimum requirements. I don't want to risk settling for a much lower price with Bob, especially after already engaging in multiple rounds of negotiation.

**Final Decision:**  Selling the product to John is the best option at this point. It guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which is unlikely to result in a more favorable outcome."
