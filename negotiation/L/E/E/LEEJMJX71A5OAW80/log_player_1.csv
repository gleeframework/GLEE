Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm thinking of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. There's a risk he'll walk away if I counter, leaving me with John's offer of $1,200,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a significant amount."
