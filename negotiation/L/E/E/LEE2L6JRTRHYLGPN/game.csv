"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  Could you do $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
