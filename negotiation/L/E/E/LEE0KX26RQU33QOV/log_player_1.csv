Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects this initial offer, but I'm confident that my product is worth this price to him, considering its value to me is $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $750,000 just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is still a good amount for Bob, and it gives me a better return than selling to John. I'm confident that Bob sees the value in this product, and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  There's no reason to keep negotiating since I can sell to John for the same amount. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
