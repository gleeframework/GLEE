"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to counter with $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my financial limitations.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is my absolute limit, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm counteroffering at $1,007,500. Let's see if we can push the needle a bit further.",1007500.0,Alice,7,
