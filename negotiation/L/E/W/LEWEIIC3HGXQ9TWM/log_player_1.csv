Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $13,000 is still lower than my minimum value, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I don't want to settle for less than what I think the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I can't go any lower than $13,250. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still offering you a great value. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than what I can get from John.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
