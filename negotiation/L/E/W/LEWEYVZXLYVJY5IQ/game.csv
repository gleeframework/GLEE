,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,250,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
