"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is tempting, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings to you, and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position.  While $950,000 is closer, we're still a bit apart. Let's split the difference.  How about $975,000? This reflects the value you'll gain from the product while ensuring a good outcome for me.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
