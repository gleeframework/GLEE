"Alice, thank you for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $800000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
