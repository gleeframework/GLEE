"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product,  $12000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. This reflects the maximum value I can see in the product for my needs.  I hope this counteroffer is reasonable.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. Considering your offer and the value we place on the product, we would like to counter with a price of $9500. We believe this offers a fair compromise between the value we see in the product and your budget constraints.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9500 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still just a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000 for the product. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and would be a fair compromise considering the value we both see in it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
