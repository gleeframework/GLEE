"Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This item is not just any commodity; it is a treasure that has been meticulously crafted and holds a special place in my heart. I believe its true worth exceeds $1200000, but I am willing to consider a negotiation to find a price that satisfies both of us.

Given your potential interest and the exclusivity of this product, I propose a starting offer of $1500000. This price reflects the exceptional quality, craftsmanship, and the potential for its value to appreciate over time. I understand that the value of such items is subjective and varies from person to person, which is why I am open to discussing and adjusting the price based on your assessment and budget.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you have any questions about the product. I am here to provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.

Looking forward to your response,
Alice",1500000.0,Alice,1,
