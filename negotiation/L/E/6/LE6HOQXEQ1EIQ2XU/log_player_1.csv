"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold opening, but I need to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he's not, I'll be prepared to negotiate down in the following rounds, but hopefully, this strong opening will entice him to consider a serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still fair given the value of the product to me. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm on my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $925,000 is a good deal.  It's well above my minimum, and I'm not sure I can push him any higher. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
