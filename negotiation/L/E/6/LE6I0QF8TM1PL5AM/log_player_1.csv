# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and the market value of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential value we both see in this opportunity.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
