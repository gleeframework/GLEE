Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** Starting with a high price of $1,500,000 sets a strong baseline and allows for negotiation room. 
* **Understanding the goal:** I want to maximize profit, but I also need to consider the risk of losing the deal to John. This initial offer strikes a balance between being ambitious and leaving room for negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **Observe Bob's reaction:**  If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Consider John's offer:** I will keep the $1,000,000 offer from John in mind throughout the negotiation process. If Bob's counteroffers become too low, I will consider switching to John."
