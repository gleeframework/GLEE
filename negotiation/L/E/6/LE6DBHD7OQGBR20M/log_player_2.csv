"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great investment for you. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  However, $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your preferred price point. You can likely negotiate further and potentially get closer to your target price of $850,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to continue negotiating and explore better options."
