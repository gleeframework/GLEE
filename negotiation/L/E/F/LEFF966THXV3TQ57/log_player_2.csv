{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000. While getting the product from Alice might have additional value, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, making it the safer and more economical choice at this point."
