Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It shows flexibility and opens the door for negotiation.
* **Message:** This is friendly and inviting, focusing on a fair price and encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, I aim to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  I am starting closer to my ideal price point, giving me more room to negotiate.
* **Encourage Bob to counteroffer:**  This allows for a back-and-forth exchange, potentially leading to a price closer to my ideal while still being acceptable to Bob.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can confidently turn to John and secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. While I am open to negotiation, his offer is too low to consider at this stage. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my negotiation position:**  It shows Bob that I am not willing to settle for a price far below my minimum value.
* **Continue the negotiation process:** This allows me to send a counteroffer and explore the possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** If further negotiation with Bob proves fruitless, I can still secure my minimum value by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,000? This price would allow me to move forward while still giving you a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $10,000:** This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is positive and encourages further discussion, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit. 

**Strategy:**

By offering $10,000, I aim to:

* **Increase my profit:**  This price is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, improving my potential earnings.
* **Test the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still secure my minimum value by selling to John."
