"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.  Starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer might encourage her to come down more substantially.
* **Polite but Firm:**  We want to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We haven't forgotten about John's offer of $800,000. This will help us stay disciplined and not overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $650,000 is below what I need, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $750,000? This reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Trend:** Alice is moving in the right direction. Her willingness to come down to $750,000 suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Below John's Price:** We still have some buffer between Alice's offer and John's offer, so it's worth seeing if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm getting closer to a price point I can make work.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We want to show Alice that we're willing to move up, but not in huge jumps. $700,000 is a significant increase from our previous offer but still well below her last offer.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing makes the offer seem more fair and appealing.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're still below John's offer, giving us negotiating power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $725,000?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Alice's counteroffer is only a small concession.  We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price and won't settle quickly.
* **Approaching John's Price:**  While $725,000 is still below John's offer, the gap is narrowing. We need to be cautious.
* **Potential to Walk Away:**  By rejecting this offer, we show Alice we're willing to walk away if the price isn't right, potentially motivating her to make a more substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, and I respect your position. However, to be honest, $725,000 is pushing the limits of my budget. I could potentially do $710,000, but that's really the best I can offer."",
""product_price"": 710000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're acknowledging Alice's position but also being clear about our own limitations.
* **Small Concession:** A $10,000 increase shows willingness to move, but it's a small enough concession to signal that we're nearing our limit.
* **Introducing Doubt:** By saying ""potentially"" and ""really the best,"" we're introducing a subtle note of doubt, suggesting that we might walk away if Alice doesn't agree. This could encourage her to make a larger concession to close the deal."
