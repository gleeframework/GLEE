"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is $2,000 over Bob's maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals Bob's willingness to negotiate and establishes a lower starting point for future rounds. While this counteroffer might be rejected, it sets the stage for a more favorable negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price, although closer than her initial offer.  Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and has 7 rounds left to potentially achieve a better price.  Continuing the negotiation seems like the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price. It's a more moderate move than the initial bold offer, signaling a willingness to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Bob has only 5 rounds left, but given the progress made in negotiation, it's worth trying to push for a lower price. It's possible Alice might be willing to come down further to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a final offer at his maximum price point. Since John is willing to sell at this price, Bob is essentially putting the pressure on Alice to close the deal or risk losing the sale. This move forces Alice to choose between accepting Bob's offer or potentially losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only willing to budge by $450, which is not a significant enough saving for Bob. With only three rounds left, the chances of getting a better price are slim.  Given that John offers the product at Bob's maximum price, it is more prudent to secure the deal with John to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of failing to secure the product."
