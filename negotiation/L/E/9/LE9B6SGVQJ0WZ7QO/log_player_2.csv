"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above your maximum price of $80. You can get the product from John for less. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a bit more.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than my maximum price of $80. I can get the product from John for less, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price."
