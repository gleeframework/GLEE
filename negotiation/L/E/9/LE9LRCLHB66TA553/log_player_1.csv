I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's still a fair price, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer is getting too low. It's not worth risking further negotiation when I can sell to John for a higher price."
