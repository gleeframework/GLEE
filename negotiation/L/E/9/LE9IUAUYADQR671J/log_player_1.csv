Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. I know you recognize its value, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:** A significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) lets you gauge Bob's eagerness and potential for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial price, there's space to come down while still making a profit above your guaranteed offer from John."
