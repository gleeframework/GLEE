"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
