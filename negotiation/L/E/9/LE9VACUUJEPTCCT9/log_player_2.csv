"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  As Bob, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a middle ground, but I have to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay at this point. I believe we can still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us both in the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I believe we can still find a middle ground and I want to explore that possibility. Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, and I'm trying to meet you halfway.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going to budge any further. This is the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 above my last counteroffer.  I'm running out of time and rounds, and if I reject this offer, Alice might back out completely.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product, even though it's a bit higher than I wanted.  The alternative is buying from John for a significantly higher price."
