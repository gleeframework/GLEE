"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth significantly more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $85? This is my final offer.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is the price I was initially quoted by John. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to buy it from you at that price.",80.0,Bob,6,
