"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $135 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to establish a lower price point, closer to Alice's value of the product. By starting lower, we leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price that's significantly below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That's still a great deal for you, and it works for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting in the middle at $125 is a good deal.  It's unlikely we'll get a price closer to $110, and $125 is a significant savings compared to John's offer."
