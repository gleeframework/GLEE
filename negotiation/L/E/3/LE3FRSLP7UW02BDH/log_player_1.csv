Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$135 offer:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value of $120 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This is a friendly and encouraging message to get Bob interested in the offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a good starting price:**  $135 is a good starting point that allows for potential negotiation.
* **Avoid rushing into the deal:**  By leaving room for negotiation, I avoid immediately accepting a low counteroffer from Bob.
* **Keep John as an option:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $120, so I can use this as a baseline if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to sell to him quickly,  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  John is still an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That's still a great deal for you, and it works for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Split the difference:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $110 and my previous offer of $135.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob and keeping the tone friendly. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  This counteroffer is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I retain leverage in the negotiation."
