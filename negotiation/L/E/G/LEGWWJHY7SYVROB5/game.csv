"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still a bit short on the profit I was hoping to make. How about we try $11,200? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11200.0,Alice,5,
