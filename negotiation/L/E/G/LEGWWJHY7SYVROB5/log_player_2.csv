"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive tone.** This helps encourage further negotiation.
* **Express interest in the product.** Showing you're serious can lead to a better deal.
* **Offer a significant but not unreasonable counter.** This leaves room for Alice to negotiate down while still giving you a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but there's still some room to bring the price down closer to our target. Let's see if we can get her to go a little lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

Here's the strategy with this counter:

* **Acknowledge Alice's compromise:** This keeps the negotiation moving in a positive direction.
* **Hold firm but be reasonable:**  We're nudging the price down without being too aggressive.
* **Offer a specific target:** This gives Alice a clear number to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still a bit short on the profit I was hoping to make. How about we try $11,200? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet us somewhere in the middle.  While we could try to negotiate a tiny bit more, $11,200 is a reasonable price and saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
