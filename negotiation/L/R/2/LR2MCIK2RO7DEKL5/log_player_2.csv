"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $10,000.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $11,500 is a good price for Bob considering the product's worth to him is $15,000 and the alternative is to buy from John for $15,000. There's a good chance Bob can get an even lower price, but it's a risk, and the potential savings are not significant enough to justify the potential delay and risk of the deal falling through."
