"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price for the next 24 hours. After that, I'll have to consider other offers. Let me know if you're interested!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $700000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.
