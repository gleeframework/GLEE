Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value. I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value but still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This is a compromise that should be appealing to Bob while still staying within my desired range. It's important to show flexibility in negotiations.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is close enough to my minimum value and the price John is offering, and it's clear we won't get much higher. I'm accepting to close the deal and secure the sale."
