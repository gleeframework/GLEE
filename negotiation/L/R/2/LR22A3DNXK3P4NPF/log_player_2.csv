"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is $1,500 above Bob's maximum value for the product. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is $500 above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It's also a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $9,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still $1,000 above Bob's maximum value.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $8,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering $8,750, which is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still being within his budget. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
