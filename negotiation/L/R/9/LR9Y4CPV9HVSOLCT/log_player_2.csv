"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer,  $10,500. This is close to his maximum budget and still leaves some room for negotiation. The message is polite and emphasizes Bob's willingness to make a deal, while also making it clear that he's not willing to pay Alice's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate in hopes of getting the price down further. There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but still keeping it below his maximum budget. He is trying to meet Alice halfway, showing his willingness to compromise. This could potentially persuade Alice to accept the offer, especially if she wants to close the deal quickly. The message emphasizes that this offer is a fair compromise, which might appeal to Alice's sense of fairness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm willing to go down to $11,250 as a final offer. It's a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While there are still 5 rounds left, the negotiation seems to be getting stuck. Bob doesn't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up paying even more than $11,250.  Therefore, buying from John for $10,000 is the most financially sensible option at this point."
