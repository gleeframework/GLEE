"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and will be tremendously beneficial for you. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you.  To move this forward, I can go as low as $1,300,000. This represents a substantial discount while still reflecting the true value of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,300,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
