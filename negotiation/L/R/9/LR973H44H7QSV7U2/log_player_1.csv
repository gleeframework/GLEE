{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $100 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $95. This is a good starting point as it allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum value of $80.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
