Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point, giving you room to negotiate while still getting a decent price. 
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing the value to Bob increases the chances of him accepting.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full minimum, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer.
* **Knowing my Backup:** If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000, so there's no real risk in pushing for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8500. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $8,500 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  I can likely negotiate a better price with Bob by making a counteroffer.
* **No Risk:** If the negotiation fails with Bob, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's still a good price for you, and allows me to make a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows willingness to negotiate without completely giving up.
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $9,500 is still a good price for him.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum of $12,000, ensuring I won't lose money if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is just $3,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a strong chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $12,000. 
* **Potential for Future Business:**  Even though it's a lower price, accepting this offer keeps a good relationship with Bob, who could be a future customer."
