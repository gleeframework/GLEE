"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm working with a tight budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,250? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",9250.0,Bob,4,
