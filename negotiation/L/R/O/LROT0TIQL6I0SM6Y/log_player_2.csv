"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $100. This is a special offer tailored for you, taking into account its worth to you at $80. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($100) is higher than your maximum budget ($80).** 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. 

It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and secure the product at a price within your budget from John."
