```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price we both feel comfortable with. However, $925,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a minimum of $975,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I understand your need to make a profit, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to finalize the deal, but I'm not willing to give up on my target price just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $970,000, which is still a compromise from my original offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price, and there are only a few rounds remaining.  It's getting close, but the risk of not reaching an agreement and missing out on the product is too high. Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees Bob gets the product, even though it's at his maximum price."
