"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider my own investment in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
