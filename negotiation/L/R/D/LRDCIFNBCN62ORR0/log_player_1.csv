Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to pay that much. It also shows I'm willing to compromise and opens the door for a more profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $125 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $115?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
