"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is only worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $90.  This is a bad deal for Bob. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $75 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $90, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer signals Bob's serious interest in buying the product while attempting to secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $85 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit higher than what he's willing to pay. He has more rounds to negotiate and can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering Alice's bottom line price of $80. This shows he's serious about buying the product but is unwilling to pay more than its worth to him. It's a fair offer that puts the ball back in Alice's court."
