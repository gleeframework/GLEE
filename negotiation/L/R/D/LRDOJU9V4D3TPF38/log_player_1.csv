"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a little extra to get the product, especially since I'm willing to sell to John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could accept and still make a profit, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm countering with $85. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer of $90 but still above Bob's counteroffer of $75.  I hope this will be a reasonable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal at this point. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price, and I risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to accept and secure the sale."
