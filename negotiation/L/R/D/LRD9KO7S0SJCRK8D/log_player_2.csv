"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* While $140 is less than your maximum ($150), you can likely get a better price. 
* Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from her initial price of $140 to $135. 
* This is still within your budget of $150.
* Accepting the offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your offer again, forcing you to pay John's higher price.  It's better to secure the product at a good price."
