Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, trying to sell to Bob first allows me to potentially earn an extra $100,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer price of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation.
    * Attractive enough compared to my backup offer ($1,200,000) to incentivize Bob to seriously consider the deal.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:**  This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
