Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $150 gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer or at least engaging in a negotiation.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I am aware that I have a backup offer of $120, so I am comfortable risking rejection if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  Bob's offer is at the minimum I'm willing to sell for. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could try to counteroffer, there's no guarantee he'll accept, and I might end up selling to John for the same price anyway.
* **Closing the Deal:** It's better to secure a sale now than risk a prolonged negotiation that might result in a lower price or no sale at all."
