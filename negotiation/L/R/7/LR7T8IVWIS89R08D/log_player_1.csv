Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm offering it to you for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate above that price with Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message hints at high demand (""interest I've received"") to justify the price and potentially encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  You could choose a less aggressive opening price if you believe Bob might be easily turned off by a high number.  However, starting high gives you more room to maneuver during the negotiation."
