Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation. It is a reasonable starting point as it is above your minimum price but below the value to Bob. This strategy allows for some flexibility in the negotiation and leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without you immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it is still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$105 is a good compromise, and it's above your minimum price of $80.  Accepting the offer ensures you make a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John."
