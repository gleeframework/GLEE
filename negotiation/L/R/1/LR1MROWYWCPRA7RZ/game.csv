"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable in the $600,000 range.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
