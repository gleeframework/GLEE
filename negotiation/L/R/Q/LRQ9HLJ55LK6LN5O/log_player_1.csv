Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $100, so he's already getting a slight discount.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're comfortable selling for at least $120, so you have room to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable first offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but you also value your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  However,  $115 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's better to continue negotiating and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $105 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
