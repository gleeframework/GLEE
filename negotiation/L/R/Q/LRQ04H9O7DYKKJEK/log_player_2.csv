(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his desired price. There's a chance he can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice or simply buy from John for $10,000."

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from his previous counteroffer, but still staying below Alice's current price. This shows Alice he's willing to negotiate but also limits his potential loss if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is now at $10,500, which is just above Bob's desired price point. Since John offers the product for $10,000, it's the better option for Bob to minimize spending."
