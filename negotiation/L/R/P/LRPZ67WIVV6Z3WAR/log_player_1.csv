Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below my minimum allows room for Bob to counter-offer. He might be willing to go a bit above $80, especially if he perceives the offer as a ""deal."" 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price."
