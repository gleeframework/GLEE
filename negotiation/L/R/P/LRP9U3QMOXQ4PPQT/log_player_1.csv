"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get a good deal.  $10,000 is a significant markup from my minimum price, and I'm confident Bob will likely counteroffer. I'm prepared to negotiate from this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway. $9,000 is a significant compromise, and I'm hopeful this will be enough to secure a deal. I'm still willing to consider selling to John, but I'm optimistic about reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price, and I'm not going to risk losing the deal by trying to squeeze out more money. I'll accept his offer and move on."
