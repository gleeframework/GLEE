"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still early in the negotiation. There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see if she's truly motivated to sell at a price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to accept it yet.  I want to see if I can get Alice down to a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $7,000.  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $8,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still pushing for a lower price.  I believe this offer is within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate further."
