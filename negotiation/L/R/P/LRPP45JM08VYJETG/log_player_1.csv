Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum.** This gives him some wiggle room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message.** This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient.
* **It expresses confidence in the product's value.** This can help sway Bob towards accepting your offer.

Remember, you can always adjust the price and message based on Bob's response. Good luck with your negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $9,000, remember your minimum is $15,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Bob further, or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  This would give you a good deal, and still allow me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $9,750?  That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum. At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and secure the $15,000. The negotiation with Bob has taken some time, and there's no guarantee you'll be able to reach a price you're happy with."
