"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product, considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
