Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel good about the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think!""

This strategy balances maximizing my potential earnings with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. I'm willing to negotiate but also have a backup option with John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to take the $6,000, it would result in a substantial loss for me. 

I believe I have a better chance of getting closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise.  

Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum price, but I want to see if I can achieve a better outcome through continued negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering at $8,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Win-Win Approach:** I'm framing the $8,500 price as a ""good deal"" for both of us, encouraging Bob to see the benefit of accepting. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking, ""Let me know what you think.""

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to come down a little further to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While $7,500 is still lower than my initial goal, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer and counter-offer again, there's a chance Bob will walk away entirely, leaving me with no sale.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing the negotiation might take more time, and I could be losing out on the potential income from selling to John.

Therefore, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and guarantees a sale."
