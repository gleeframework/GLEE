"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'll see what his reaction is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not going to accept such a drastic drop in price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing some flexibility. However, it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $1,200,000 offer. I'm not willing to go that low, especially since John is offering a significantly higher price. I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to considering John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a further decrease from my previous offer, but still a good amount above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows a commitment to finding a deal while remaining firm on a price that reflects the value of the product. If he rejects this, I'll strongly consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is showing no real willingness to compromise, and his offer is getting further away from my minimum acceptable price. It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement with him.  At this point, John's offer is a much more attractive option. I'm going to sell to John and secure a good price for the product."
