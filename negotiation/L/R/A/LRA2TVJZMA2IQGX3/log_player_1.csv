Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $7,000 at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $7,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This product will truly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 8750}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal. However, $7,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  What if we settle at $8,250? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't go that high.  I'd be willing to do $7,750. That's the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than to risk getting even less from Bob or letting the negotiations drag on."
