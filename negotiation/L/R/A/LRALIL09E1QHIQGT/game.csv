"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in your product, but my budget for this is $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $9,500.  I really believe this product would be a great addition to my business and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
