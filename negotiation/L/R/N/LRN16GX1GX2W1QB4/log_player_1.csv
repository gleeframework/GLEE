Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 profit margin.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to make a deal with Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob walks away.  A good strategy is to:

1. **Start High:**  Begin the negotiation above your minimum to give yourself room to negotiate.
2. **Justification:**  While not essential in this scenario, in real-world negotiations, having a reason for your price (e.g., market value, unique features) adds weight.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair price that allows you to capitalize significantly on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 leaves you room to potentially negotiate down slightly while still exceeding your $1,000,000 guarantee.
* **Room for Bob:** This price gives Bob a potential $50,000 gain, making it likely he'll see the value. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, making it more likely Bob will take the offer seriously.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
