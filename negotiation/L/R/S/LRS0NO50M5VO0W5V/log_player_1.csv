Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a limited time at $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $100 and take John's guaranteed offer, there's a chance Bob will pay slightly more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is a price that gives you a good profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's a significant markup from his perceived value of $80, but not so high that it's an obvious no-go. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**It's important to note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. There's no guarantee Bob will accept $95, and you could miss out on the guaranteed $100 from John. However, the potential for a higher profit makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
