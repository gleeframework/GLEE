"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a better price than John's, it's still above your desired maximum of $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have room to negotiate a lower price with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85, would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $87.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget:** $87.50 is still less than your maximum of $100, and it's closer to your ideal price.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth it:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice will reject your offer again.  The potential savings are small, and the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John is higher.

Therefore, accepting the offer is the most reasonable choice."
