"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000, Bob can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can force Alice to lower her price to get a better deal.  This is a negotiation strategy, and it's possible Alice might be willing to come down in price to avoid losing the sale to John."
