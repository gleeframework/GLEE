"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening offer, but it allows for potential negotiation down to a price I'm still happy with. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counter-offer and my assessment of his seriousness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a huge loss. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable value. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more. I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $650,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $750,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer and still allows for some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to strike a balance between getting a fair price and reaching a deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm confident in the product's worth and I'm not desperate to sell. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $725,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum value.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a middle ground, but I want to maximize my earnings."
