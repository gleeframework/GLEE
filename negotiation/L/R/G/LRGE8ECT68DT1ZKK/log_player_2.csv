"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer in Round 1.  You know you can get the product from John for the same price.  Rejecting allows you to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move, demonstrating that I'm serious about negotiating and aiming for a substantial discount. It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, but it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to keep negotiating.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there's room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth less than $850,000.  It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still not willing to give in this early in the negotiation. There are still 5 rounds remaining. I believe I can push for a lower price. The goal is to maximize my savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again increasing my offer, but still keeping it below Alice's current offer. This signals my willingness to negotiate and move closer to a deal. It's a moderate increase that shows progress without giving away too much. With only 4 rounds left, I want to be close to a reasonable price point, but I'm not giving up the fight for a better deal just yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  With only 3 rounds left, it's likely that further negotiation will only yield small savings.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer or the possibility of having to buy from John at a higher price."
