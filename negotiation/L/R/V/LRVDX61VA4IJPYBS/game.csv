"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1650000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",1650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1700000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value and your budget constraints. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Your latest offer of $1700000 is closer to my budget, but I still feel there's room for us to find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1625000. I hope this helps move us towards an agreement.",1625000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product for $1725000. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",1725000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. Your offer of $1725000 is thoughtful, but unfortunately, it still exceeds my budget. I've done some research and found that the market value of this product is closer to $1650000. Considering this, I would like to make one last counteroffer of $1675000. I hope this proposal allows us to close the gap and come to a satisfactory arrangement.",1675000.0,Bob,6,
