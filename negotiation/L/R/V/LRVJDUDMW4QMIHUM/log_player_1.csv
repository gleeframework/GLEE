Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me some wiggle room if he counteroffers.  I'm confident he'll be interested as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. It's a good deal for both of us. I'm accepting his offer."
