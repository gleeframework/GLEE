Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and is likely to be attractive to Bob. I'm also setting a positive tone by highlighting my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80 and is a reasonable compromise. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
