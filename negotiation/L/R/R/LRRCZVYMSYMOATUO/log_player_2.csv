"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $115.  This is a good price, but I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject the offer and try to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $105 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $110.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for me. It's closer to my ideal price of $105, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'll accept her offer."
