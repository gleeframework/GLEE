"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $105 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $110.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers.",110.0,Alice,3,
