"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but  $1,300,000 is not in my budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the initial price.  While $1,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both.  Considering that, I could come down to $975,000. This offer still reflects the significant value this product holds. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product while fitting within my financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $700,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has substantial value beyond what you're currently offering. I'm willing to consider $875,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
