Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives Alice a strong bottom line. She doesn't *need* to go below that price."
