,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable going up to $135. What do you think?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $145. It's the best I can do.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $155. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
