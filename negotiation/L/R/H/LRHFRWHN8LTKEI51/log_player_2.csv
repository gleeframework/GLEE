"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's plenty of room for negotiation. I can definitely try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product has great potential. I'm interested, but $800,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $550,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to invest while still giving you a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 550000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but I still think there's room for negotiation. I'll try to meet her halfway between our last offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price point closer to $625,000. This would be a comfortable investment for me while acknowledging the product's value.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 625000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I think this is a fair compromise and would love to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice stating this is her lowest price may be a negotiating tactic, but it's risky to push further. Still, I'll try one more time to see if I can get closer to $650,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we land on $650,000?  This price works well for me and would allow us to close this deal today. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is holding firm at $675,000, and has reiterated it's her final offer twice.  While I'd prefer to reach $650,000, we're close enough that continuing the negotiation poses a greater risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting at $675,000 secures the product at a significant saving compared to John's offer."
