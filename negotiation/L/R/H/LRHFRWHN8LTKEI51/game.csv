"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product has great potential. I'm interested, but $800,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $550,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to invest while still giving you a fair price.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price point closer to $625,000. This would be a comfortable investment for me while acknowledging the product's value.  What do you think?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I think this is a fair compromise and would love to hear your thoughts.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we land on $650,000?  This price works well for me and would allow us to close this deal today. What do you say?",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",675000.0,Alice,7,
