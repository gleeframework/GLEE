"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than the maximum he's willing to pay, he can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Price:**  Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's value for the product, showing he's willing to negotiate in good faith. 
* **Potential for Savings:** This offer is still below Bob's maximum price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message clearly states Bob's position and the price he's willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 was a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $95, but I really think the product is worth more than that to you. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're thinking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:**  While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of saving as much money as possible. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob has already demonstrated that he's willing to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price.  There's likely room for further negotiation.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the option open to get a lower price, especially as there are still multiple rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it would get us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Bob is showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement by offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The offer is a compromise, suggesting that Bob is serious about getting a deal done.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Bob emphasizes fairness for both parties, highlighting the rationale behind his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $90. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we try $92.50? That's a bit more than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $92.50 is very close to Bob's desired price point.  He's likely to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:** Alice has shown some flexibility but is unlikely to come down further. 
* **Potential for Future Deal:** Even if Bob rejects and gets a lower price, it's likely Alice will stick to her current position. There's a risk of losing the deal completely.
* **Time Constraints:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of not getting a deal at all."
