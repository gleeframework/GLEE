"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1350000 is simply not enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1550000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
