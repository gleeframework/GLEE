"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I need to get at least $940,000 for this to make sense on my end. That's my final offer.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $940,000, which would be $930,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",930000.0,Bob,6,
