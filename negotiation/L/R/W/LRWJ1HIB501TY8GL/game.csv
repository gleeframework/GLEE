"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that's within my budget and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see we're getting closer to a deal.  However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
