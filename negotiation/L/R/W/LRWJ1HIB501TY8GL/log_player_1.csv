Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum desired price ($1,000,000) but still allows for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll receive. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 

**Why this approach:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer provides a starting point for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, but it allows me to gauge his interest and begin the bargaining process.
* **Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000. This provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Potential Profit:**  While $900,000 is less than my ideal, it's still a significant profit and allows me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that's within my budget and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to accept. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation. 

* **Reasoning:** My minimum is $1,000,000, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower. I have a safety net with John's offer, so I can afford to be a bit more demanding.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see we're getting closer to a deal.  However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $875,000 is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept. I'm also reminding him of the value of the product to reinforce my stance. 

**Why this approach:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm flexible but still have room to negotiate. 
* **Urgency:**  By stating it's my final offer, I aim to push Bob towards accepting. 
* **Maintaining Value:** While I'm lowering the price, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum and reflects the value of the product."
