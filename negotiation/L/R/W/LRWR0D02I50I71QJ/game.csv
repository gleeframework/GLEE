"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! It's a tempting product, but $15000 is quite a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $9500.  This is a fair price considering I'm already willing to spend more than my initial budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9500.  It's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident that we can come to an agreement.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,7,
