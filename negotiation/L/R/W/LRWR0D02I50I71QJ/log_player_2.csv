Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,500.  It's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident that we can come to an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still above my budget, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  While there's a chance she might come down further, it's not guaranteed.  I've reached a point where the risk of continuing to negotiate is greater than the potential savings.  It's best to secure the product from John for $8,000, ensuring I get a good deal within my budget."
