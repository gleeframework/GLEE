"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000. This price would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:**  Alice has dropped her price to $1,350,000, which is much closer to Bob's target than her initial offer of $1,400,000. 
* **Saving money:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy at a higher price from John. The potential gain from further negotiation is small compared to the risk."
