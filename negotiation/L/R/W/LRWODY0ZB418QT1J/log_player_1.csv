Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what it can do for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Even though Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice knows its worth much more to her.  A high starting price leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond John's offer.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" Alice aims to frame the price in a way that resonates with Bob, potentially exceeding his initial valuation.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is open for discussion. If Bob rejects the $20,000, Alice can counter-offer, potentially still securing a deal above $15,000.
* **Safety Net:** If negotiations fail, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit.  Ethical considerations and long-term business relationships should also factor into real-world negotiation tactics."
