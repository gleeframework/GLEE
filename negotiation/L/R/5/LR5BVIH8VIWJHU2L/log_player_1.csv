This offer is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is my best offer, considering I can buy the product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
