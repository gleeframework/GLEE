"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand it's a bit more than you were hoping to spend, but $65 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

 ""product_price"": 75
}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, Bob! It seems like we both see the value in this product. How about we make it a deal at $85? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $85 is getting closer to your budget, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when you can get the product for your target price elsewhere."
