"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has great potential, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $500,000. Would you be willing to consider something in that range?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to get the price closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $550,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $550,000 is getting closer, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $520,000.  Would you be open to that?",520000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $520,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $530,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",530000.0,Alice,5,
