I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit above my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully allows me to get a good price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. It's closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm counteroffering at $140.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for him to accept."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $135.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  I'm getting closer to my goal of maximizing my earnings, and I'm not risking losing a sale to John."
