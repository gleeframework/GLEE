"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him. This subtly pressures him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm using language like ""Let me know what you think"" to show I'm open to negotiation. 

**Note:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he has shown willingness to negotiate. This means there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price in the next rounds. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome. However, I believe I can potentially get closer to this price through continued negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, while still leaving room for compromise."
