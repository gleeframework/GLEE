Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have a strong fallback position. Your goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 splits the difference between Bob's perceived value and John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit above Bob's valuation.
* **Exclusivity and Urgency:**  By framing the offer as exclusive and time-sensitive, you add a level of pressure that might encourage Bob to accept."
