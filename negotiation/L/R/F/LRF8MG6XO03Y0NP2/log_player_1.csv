Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option) adds a time pressure that might encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob would ideally want to pay $1,000,000. You need to convince him that the extra $150,000 is worth the value he's getting.
* **Relationship Building:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, a respectful and professional interaction could lead to future business opportunities."
