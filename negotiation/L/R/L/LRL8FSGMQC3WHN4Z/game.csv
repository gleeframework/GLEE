"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1150000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to go up to $1120000, but no higher. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
