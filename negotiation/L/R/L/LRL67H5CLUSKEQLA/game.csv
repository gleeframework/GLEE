"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I see the potential in this product, my budget is capped at $800,000. To make progress, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value I place on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't let it go for that price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and represents a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
