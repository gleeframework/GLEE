Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility and understanding of the situation.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget and represents a significant price reduction from the initial offer.  It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming, and there's no guarantee of a better price.  Considering the potential for further delays and the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer, it's a good strategy for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product."
