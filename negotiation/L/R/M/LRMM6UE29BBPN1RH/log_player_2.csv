At this point, I'm not going to accept her offer of $975,000. I'd like to reject her offer and stick to my original offer of $970,000.

However, since I've already made it clear that I'm not willing to go any higher than $970,000, I'm not sure if Alice will accept it again. In this case, I think it's time to consider buying the product from John for $1,000,000, as I've already established that's the maximum price I'm willing to pay.
