Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a fair price given the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 160}
