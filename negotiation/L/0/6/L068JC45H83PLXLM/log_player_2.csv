# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its true value, and it's a deal you won't find anywhere else.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Explanation:**

* Alice is offering the product at its full value, which is $1,000,000. 
* You are looking to save money and are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000.
* John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is the same price as Alice's offer.
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John offers no benefit.
* Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open for a potential better price."
