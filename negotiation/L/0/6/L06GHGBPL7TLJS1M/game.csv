"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable going as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $850,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
