"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob will see its value too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,800,000 is still below my target price, and I believe I can get closer to that with further negotiation.  I'm going to use this opportunity to send him a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I want to show him I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give the product away.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my target, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1875000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,875,000. This is a smaller drop from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm getting closer to accepting a deal.  I'm hoping this will prompt Bob to make a final, and hopefully successful, offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,825,000.  While it's still not my ideal price, I've reached a point where I'm comfortable with the deal.  We've been negotiating for a while, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away. I'm also worried that I'm running out of rounds and might have to sell to John for a lower price. It's important to secure the deal at a price that's acceptable, even if it's not my absolute top target."
