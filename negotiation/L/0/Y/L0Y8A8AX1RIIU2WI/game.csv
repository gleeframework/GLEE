"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with a price of $900,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we settle at $850,000? This still allows for a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $900,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $812,500.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",812500.0,Alice,5,
