Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $812,500.

``` 

Bob's offer of $806,250 is slightly above my minimum target of $800,000.  It's better to accept this offer than risk going further and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John at my minimum."
