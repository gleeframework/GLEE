"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and  leaves less room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal happen. It's still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to increase my offer to $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  However,  $10,500 still falls short of what I need. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. I am willing to consider $10,700 as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,700 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's also a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $12,000. It's best to accept this offer and avoid risking losing the sale to John or further rounds of negotiation."
