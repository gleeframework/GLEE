,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for us both to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's true value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's try to reach a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit.  This is a final offer from my side. Let me know if you're willing to work with this price.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me while still leaving you with a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is unfortunately still not a price I can accept.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to make one last compromise and drop to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to close the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
