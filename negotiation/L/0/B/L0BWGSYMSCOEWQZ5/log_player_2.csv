Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's true value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's try to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit.  This is a final offer from my side. Let me know if you're willing to work with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is unfortunately still not a price I can accept.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to make one last compromise and drop to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to close the deal.
