{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500? It's still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $11,000. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I won't find a better deal within the remaining rounds."
