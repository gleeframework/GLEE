Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to him, I'll try to get a good price. I'll offer him the product for $110.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $105 is higher than my minimum price of $100, I'll consider accepting his offer. However, since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I think I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob the product for $108.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he was willing to pay $105, I'll try to get a bit closer to the true value of the product to him. I'll offer him the product for $115.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll think carefully about this one. Since Bob's offer of $108 is still below the true value of the product to him, I think I can get a better price. However, I also don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. I'll decide to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $108.
