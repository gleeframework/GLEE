{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is still above Bob's estimated worth of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Below my minimum:** It's below my minimum of $15,000, but gives me room to negotiate up if Bob counters.
* **Motivates Bob:**  It's a good enough offer to potentially entice Bob to counter, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation. 

I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe we can reach a fair agreement. I would like to propose $9,500 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. While I could continue to negotiate with him, the risk of further price reductions and the time involved make it more advantageous to sell to John for $15,000."
