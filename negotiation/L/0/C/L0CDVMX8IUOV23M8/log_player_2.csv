"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is less than your maximum, you can likely get a better deal.  You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's offer of $100 and your estimated value of $80. This gives Alice a profit, while still saving you $10 compared to Alice's original offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $95 is a better deal than buying from John for $120. While there might be a small chance to squeeze out another $5, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $120 outweighs the potential benefit."
