"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. This product would be really valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $12,000? I feel that would be a reasonable price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $12,000 is still quite low considering what this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, but that's my final offer.  It's a great deal for a product of this caliber.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your understanding.  While that offer is tempting, I'm working with a firm budget.  I could potentially do $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,6,
