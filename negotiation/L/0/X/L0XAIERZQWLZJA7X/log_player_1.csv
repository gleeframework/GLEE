"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. This product would be really valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $12,000? I feel that would be a reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $12,000 is still quite low considering what this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, but that's my final offer.  It's a great deal for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your understanding.  While that offer is tempting, I'm working with a firm budget.  I could potentially do $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to meet the minimum price of $15,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
