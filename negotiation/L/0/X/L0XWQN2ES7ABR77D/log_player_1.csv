Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is only worth $800,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,000,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high with your initial offer, leaving room to negotiate down if needed. Since you have a strong alternative (John), you're in a good position to be firm.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting significantly above Bob's valuation, but not unreasonably so.
* **Confident Tone:**  You're positioning the product as valuable and desirable.
* **Room to Negotiate:** The $950,000 price tag allows for potential negotiation down towards Bob's maximum, while still keeping you well above your guaranteed price from John.

**Important Note:** This is just the first move. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting his offer or moving on to John."
