"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you and the value it holds for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm ready to offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
