"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be selling this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $22,000 to start. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $15,000 to her, I'm going to try to get it for a price that's closer to that. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is quite a ways below my bottom line. Could you do $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. Since I've already rejected her offer of $18,000, I'll try to get closer to my target price of $8,000. Here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
