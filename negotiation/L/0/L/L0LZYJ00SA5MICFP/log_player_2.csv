**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This means you'll save $3,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You're still getting a good deal.** While Alice values the product at $8,000, you are getting it for $12,000, which is still below your maximum price point."
