"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from what it's worth to you. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we bring it down a bit to something more manageable?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward quickly.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's bridge the gap a little more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  $1,000,000 is getting close, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting very close.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
