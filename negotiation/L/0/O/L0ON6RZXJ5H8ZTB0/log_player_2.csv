"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from what it's worth to you. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward quickly.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975,000 is still below my minimum.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting very close.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.

Alice has met your previous counter offer.  This is a good deal and there's little to be gained by pushing further.  Accepting now ensures you get the product at a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and your backup option with John."
