"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize my potential profit. However, it's still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $8,500. This still gives you a great deal considering the value of the product to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7750. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $8,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250 as a final concession. This price reflects the product's value to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8250, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $7875. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,875 is closer to my minimum acceptable value than before, I'm starting to feel the pressure with only a few rounds left. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with.  John is offering my desired price, so selling to him guarantees a good outcome for me."
