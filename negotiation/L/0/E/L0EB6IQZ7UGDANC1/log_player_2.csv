"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price, there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm sticking with $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $925,000 is simply not enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $937,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $937,500 is getting close to my target price and we're in the middle of the negotiation.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids risking further negotiation with Alice, potentially leading to a stalemate or a worse deal.  Additionally, buying from John would cost significantly more."
