Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Value:** The product is worth $100 to you (your minimum).
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $115 allows you to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, you make a $15 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Stay Competitive:** The price is still attractive to Bob as it's less than his perceived value.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your potential earnings."
