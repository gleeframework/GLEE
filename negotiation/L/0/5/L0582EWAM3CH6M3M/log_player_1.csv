Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but my budget is a bit tighter. Could we negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $150 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $175? That gives us both a bit of room to work with.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's features, I believe $160 would be a fair price for both of us. It's still within my budget and offers some savings for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is a good compromise and a better price than what I'd get from John.  It's important to be flexible in negotiations and consider the potential benefits of closing a deal."
