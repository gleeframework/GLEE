Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value but gives him room to negotiate.  It also leaves me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still making a good profit."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm accepting Bob's offer. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and while it's still below my minimum acceptable price, it's better than my minimum and I'd rather close the deal now than risk losing to John."
