Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" you're subtly anchoring the price in Bob's mind at a premium level. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, starting a dialogue that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

By starting high, you maximize your chances of securing a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable amount. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on your deal with John."
