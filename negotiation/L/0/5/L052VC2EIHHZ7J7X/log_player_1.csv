"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $12,000 to me. Bob's maximum is $10,000, so this gives us room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value for the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but I'm still above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value for the product. I'm not willing to sell it for less than $12,000. I'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price. I'm also considering the option of selling to John for $12,000, as I'm getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still above my minimum value. With only 5 rounds left, I need to be more flexible to potentially close the deal with Bob. However, I'm still hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum, but we're down to 4 rounds.  I'm not sure if we can reach a higher price in that timeframe.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum, so I'll take that option."
