{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is slightly above the product's worth to me. This leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I'm getting a profit. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer. I'm highlighting the value of the product to make it seem like a good deal.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:** By starting high, I leave room to negotiate down to a price that is still profitable for me.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** Mentioning John as another potential buyer might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

It's important to remember that this is just an initial offer. I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and negotiate a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but still below John's offer. I want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation and potentially secure a better price than John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives me a profit while allowing you to get the product at a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $105, which is a compromise. It's above Bob's offer but below my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone and acknowledging Bob's perspective. I'm highlighting the benefit of this price for both of us, making it seem like a win-win situation. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** By lowering the price, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and encourage Bob to counter with a higher price.
* **Maintain profit margin:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profit. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the conversation active and prevent the negotiation from stalling.

I will carefully assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $100 I can get from John. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob. I'll propose a price that's just slightly below John's offer. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to drop my price to $98. This is the absolute lowest I can go, as I need to make a profit. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $98, which is just $2 below John's offer. This gives Bob a decent deal while ensuring I don't lose out on a better price.
* **Message:** I'm using a combination of friendliness and firmness. I express appreciation for Bob's interest and highlight the value he'll get with this offer. At the same time, I emphasize that this is my absolute lowest price, creating a sense of finality.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Secure a price close to my minimum:** $98 is only $2 below my desired price of $100, maximizing my profit.
* **Create urgency:**  I'm implying that this is my final offer, encouraging Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Maintain a positive relationship:**  I'm being polite and respectful, even though I'm standing firm on my price.

This is my last offer. If Bob rejects it, I will sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm not willing to pay $98. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd like to get a better deal, I'm not willing to risk selling for so much less than John's offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit margin:**  $85 is a loss for me, as the product is worth at least $100 to me. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  By selling to John, I can ensure a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who may continue to offer lower prices.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would require more time and effort, which I'm not willing to invest for a lower price.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most sensible option, as it guarantees a profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
