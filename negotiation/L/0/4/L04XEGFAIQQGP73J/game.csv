"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I see in the product.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While that's closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. Would you consider $1,150,000? I'm hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product provides.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
