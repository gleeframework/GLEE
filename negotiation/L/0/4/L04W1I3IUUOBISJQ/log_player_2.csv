Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $150 is my initial asking price, I could meet you halfway at $125. This would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Round 4

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $115?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while we could push for a lower price, it's unlikely we'd get much further below $115. Accepting this offer saves us $5 compared to John's price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
