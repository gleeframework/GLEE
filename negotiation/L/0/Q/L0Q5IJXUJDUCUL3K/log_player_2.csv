"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This is a special offer tailored to discerning buyers like yourself who appreciate exceptional value. Please let me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100 maximum.
* Alice's offer is $95, which is still above your maximum.
* You can get the product from John for $100, which is your maximum price point. 

Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
