Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a more reasonable starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but I have budgetary constraints.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000? This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.
