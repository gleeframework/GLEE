"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a more reasonable starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but I have budgetary constraints.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000? This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
