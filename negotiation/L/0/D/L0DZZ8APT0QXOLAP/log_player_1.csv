Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While we could start higher, going too close to $1,200,000 might make Bob feel like we're not giving him a fair deal and could scare him off.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $1,100,000 or a little less still represents a significant gain compared to John's offer of $800,000."
