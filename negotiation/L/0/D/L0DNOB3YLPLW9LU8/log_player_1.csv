Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a public listing creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  How you proceed depends on Bob's response. Be prepared to potentially negotiate down slightly if needed, but always keeping your $15,000 minimum in mind."
