"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $650,000. Would that be feasible?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $675,000 for the product. I think this is as close as I can get to your target, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable investment.",675000.0,Alice,5,
