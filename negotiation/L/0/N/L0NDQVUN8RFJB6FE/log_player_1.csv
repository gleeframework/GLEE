Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $175. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $250) might scare Bob away without a counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  A brief comment about ""quality"" aims to subtly reinforce the value proposition to Bob.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and avoiding losing the sale to John."
