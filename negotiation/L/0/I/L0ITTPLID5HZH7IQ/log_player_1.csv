Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, securing a deal with Bob above our minimum ($12,000) means potentially earning more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $11,000 gives Bob a perceived discount while still leaving room for potential negotiation. It's a price point that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but not so high that it's immediately dismissed. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and suggests that the offer is a good deal for Bob, potentially increasing his likelihood of accepting."
