"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a large portion of the value Bob sees in the product.  It's a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied with the profit. I'll reject his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good profit. This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still gives me a significant profit.  It's a good middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise. However, I'm still holding out for a profit that's more than what John is offering. It's a good middle ground for this round and gives me some room to maneuver in future rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the negotiation alive and leaves room for me to potentially get a better price. I have 4 rounds left and I believe I can still get a better offer from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing flexibility and acknowledging that we're nearing a deal.  This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, but it still allows me to gain a substantial profit. With only 3 rounds left, it's time to try and close the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer, but with 2 rounds remaining, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject this offer and see if I can convince Bob to increase his offer one last time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm  increasing my offer slightly to try and meet Bob in the middle, knowing that time is running out. This offer is still above John's offer, but it's a significant compromise. I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob in this final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough one.  Bob's offer is the same as John's, but it's the last round.  While I would love to get a higher price, I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob.  The risk of losing the deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high. It's better to secure the deal with John and get my minimum."
