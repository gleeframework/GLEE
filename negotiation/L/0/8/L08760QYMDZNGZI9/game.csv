"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to be flexible on the price. Let's start with $1,750,000. This price reflects the product's quality and potential while leaving room for negotiation.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000, which still offers you a great deal considering its potential.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is truly worth. Let's compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. How about we try $1,250,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
