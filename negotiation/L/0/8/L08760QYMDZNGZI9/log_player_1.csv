"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to be flexible on the price. Let's start with $1,750,000. This price reflects the product's quality and potential while leaving room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is more than what Bob values the product at, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can still get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000, which still offers you a great deal considering its potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is truly worth. Let's compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. How about we try $1,250,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to 4 rounds and the negotiation is getting too close to my bottom line.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and it's unlikely he will increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds.  It's better to sell to John now and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 rather than risk losing out on a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
