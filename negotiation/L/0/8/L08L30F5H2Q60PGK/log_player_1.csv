"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly opening:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Reasoning:**  Highlighting the value of the product to Bob might make him consider the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by countering.
* **Time is on my side:** With 8 rounds left, I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to close the deal to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Positive language:**  I'm remaining friendly and positive to maintain a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $92.5 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and being forced to sell to John for $100.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** Even if I accept, Bob might counter again, potentially bringing the price closer to $100."
