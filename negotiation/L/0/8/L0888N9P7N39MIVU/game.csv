"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your budget, I'm hoping for a price closer to $150.  Let's split the difference and try $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still interested in working with you, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure I can go to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $125?,125.0,Bob,6,
