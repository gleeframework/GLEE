Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your budget, I'm hoping for a price closer to $150.  Let's split the difference and try $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to hold out for a bit more. I'm still hopeful I can close the deal with Bob at a price that is more favorable to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still interested in working with you, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a price from Bob that's closer to my minimum. It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
