{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a little further to $13,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential savings you'll realize."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
