Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,200,000 (this is my safety net if Bob rejects the offer).
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation space:** I have a $300,000 space to negotiate.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  Offering $1,450,000 gives me a good chance of maximizing my profit while still being attractive to Bob. It's a strong offer that is closer to my minimum price, giving me more profit if he accepts, but it's still within his range of willingness to pay.

If Bob accepts, I gain $250,000 more than my minimum. If Bob rejects, I still get my minimum price from John. This strategy balances the potential for a higher gain with the security of my minimum price."
