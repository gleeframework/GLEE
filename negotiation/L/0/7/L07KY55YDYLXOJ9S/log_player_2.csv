"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least that much to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's tempting to consider her offer as you value the product at $800,000, it's more beneficial to reject her offer and purchase from John at the agreed-upon price of $800,000. This saves you $50,000."
