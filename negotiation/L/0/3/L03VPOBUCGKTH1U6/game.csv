"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, your price is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.  I'm willing to offer you $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued negotiation.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $850,000?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000, but I need you to agree to a 5-year warranty and maintenance package, which will add some value to the overall deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the addition of the warranty and maintenance package.  However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $900,000.  I'm willing to agree to a 3-year warranty and maintenance package if we can come to an agreement on the price.  I would like to offer $875,000 for the product with a 3-year warranty and maintenance package.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate the 3-year warranty and maintenance package. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $887,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price still reflects the product's true value, but I'm willing to make a concession to reach an agreement.",887500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, and I recognize the value of the product.  However, $887,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $862,500 for the product with the 3-year warranty and maintenance package.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this can be a win-win situation.",862500.0,Bob,8,
