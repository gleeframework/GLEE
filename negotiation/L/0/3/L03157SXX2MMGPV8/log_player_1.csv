Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested, as this is a time-sensitive offer."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a significantly higher price ($1,200,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your own minimum price. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""time-sensitive offer"" adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts the initial offer or a negotiated price close to it, you significantly exceed your minimum.
2. **Leave room for negotiation:** You can always lower the price during negotiations, but you can't raise it if you start too low.
3. **Secure a quick sale:** The urgency might prompt Bob to accept a higher price than he might otherwise consider.

**Worst-Case Scenario:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have your fallback option of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
