Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and holds significant value for someone like you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to maximize my profit. Selling to Bob for a price between $800,000 (his valuation) and $1,000,000 (John's offer) achieves this.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with $950,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go much lower knowing I have another buyer.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as favorable for Bob."
