"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $142.50?  It's still a good deal for both of us.",142.5,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $126?",126.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $126 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $134?  That's only a small increase from your last offer.",134.0,Alice,5,
