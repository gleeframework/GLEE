{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room for negotiation. It also conveys a sense of confidence and fairness, hopefully making Bob more receptive to discussing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to go for the $900,000,  I'm confident I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now within my minimum acceptable range, and closer to my desired price point. Accepting this offer secures a sale and allows me to move forward."
