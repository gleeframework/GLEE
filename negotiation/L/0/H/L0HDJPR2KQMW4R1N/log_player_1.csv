{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a large profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This makes it more likely he'll accept, as he can still gain value. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  The offer is straightforward and focuses on the key point: the price. 

By starting with this offer, you open the door for a negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise given the worth of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what you believe the product is worth.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob. This counteroffer should be higher than $850,000 but lower than your initial offer of $950,000.  A good counteroffer might be $900,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $875000. This amount reflects a balance between the value I see in the product and what I am comfortable paying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still significantly lower than what you believe the product is worth.  You've already conceded once from your initial offer of $950,000.  

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  You could try $890,000, or even go slightly lower to $885,000.  This will signal to Bob that you're serious about getting a price you're happy with, while also showing some flexibility."
