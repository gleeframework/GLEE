"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $10,500 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great price for a product that's worth $10,000 to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
