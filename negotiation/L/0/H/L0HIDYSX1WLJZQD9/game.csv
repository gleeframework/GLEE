"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $95.  Would you be willing to come down just a little bit more?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get it for $95, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but that's still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100.  Let's make this deal happen!",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $105, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,7,
