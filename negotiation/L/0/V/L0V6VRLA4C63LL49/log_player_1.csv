Round 3

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800

While I'd like to get more, Bob is holding firm and we are getting close to my fallback price. Taking the $13,800 is better than risking him walking away completely."
