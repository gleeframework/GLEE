Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product's worth and Bob's maximum valuation.  Starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation ($19,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can always lower the price slightly.  This might be enough to entice Bob while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice knows Bob is particularly price-sensitive, she might start with a slightly lower offer to avoid alienating him. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell the product quickly, she might be more aggressive with her initial offer to avoid delays."
