Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher asking price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""worth"", you subtly reinforce the product's significance, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's perspective, making it clear that you're open to discussion.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still being reasonable enough to potentially secure a deal with Bob."
