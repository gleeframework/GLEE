Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer considering his potential counteroffers, I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or secure the full $1,200,000 from John. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  The product is worth a lot to both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to $1,200,000 to make this work. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a stalemate.  Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,200,000, it's in my best interest to secure the deal with him and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
