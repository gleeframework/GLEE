"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can work out a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  The product is worth a lot to both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to $1,200,000 to make this work. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the discount you're offering. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm committed to finding a solution, so I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer. How about $1,125,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $1,075,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but it shows my commitment to finalizing a deal.  How about it?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
