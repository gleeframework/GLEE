"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 is a good starting point.** It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and optimistic.**  It emphasizes the product's value to Bob and invites him to engage in the negotiation. 

This approach aims to:

* **Start the negotiation on a positive note.**
* **Give Bob a reasonable offer that he's likely to consider.**
* **Leave room for potential counteroffers and further negotiation.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. 

* **Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation.**
* **It also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.**
* **The next round will allow me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is close to Bob's offer:**  I'm offering $95, which is only $5 away from Bob's offer of $90. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both of us, which can be more appealing than simply trying to push for a higher price.
* **Focus on moving forward:**  I'm also suggesting that this price allows us to ""move forward with the sale,"" which adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Can you consider meeting me at $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to save as much as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price point, and it's getting increasingly likely that he might not budge further.  Given that I only have 10 rounds and John is willing to pay $80, accepting this offer is the most logical move.  It ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of having to settle for less or even sell to John for $80."
