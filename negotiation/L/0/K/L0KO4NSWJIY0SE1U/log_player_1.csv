Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You've already established that $12,000 is your minimum, so this offer leaves room for negotiation without jeopardizing your own needs.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, but also shows that you're willing to be flexible. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond accordingly. 

Remember, you can always adjust this price based on Bob's response and the dynamics of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000), it's still lower than your initial offer. You want to maximize your profit, and rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Maintains your position:**  It's above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Shows flexibility:** It's lower than your original offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Offers a clear compromise:** The $13,500 price is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's offer.

This tactic aims to find a middle ground while still aiming for a good price for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good price:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 less than your last counteroffer and is a good price for the product. 
* **Risk of losing deal:** If you reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, there's a chance Bob will walk away entirely.  
* **John's offer:**  While John is a backup option at $12,000, accepting Bob's offer means a $1,000 profit increase.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable choice in this situation, securing a profitable deal while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
