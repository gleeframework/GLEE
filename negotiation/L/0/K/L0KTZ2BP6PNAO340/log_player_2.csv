"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, Bob can likely get a better price. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $11000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position to negotiate. He has 7 rounds left and Alice has shown she's willing to come down. While $12,000 is tempting, Bob can likely push for a lower price, especially with his goal of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm ready to pay $11,500.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11500}
