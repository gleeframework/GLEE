"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $11000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm ready to pay $11500.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",11500.0,Bob,4,
