Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $16,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's exact willingness to pay above $12,000 is unknown. This offer will help gauge that.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
