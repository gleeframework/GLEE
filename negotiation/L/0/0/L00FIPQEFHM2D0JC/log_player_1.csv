Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good middle ground between my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's estimated value ($12,000).
* **Emphasizing value:** I highlight the benefit for Bob, emphasizing that he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** By saying ""Let me know what you think"", I'm opening the door for counteroffers and further negotiation. 

This approach allows for a good starting point while remaining flexible and open to reaching a mutually agreeable price."
