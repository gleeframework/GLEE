**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's beneficial for me within the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees I get my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob not budging enough."
