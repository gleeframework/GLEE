"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product, but I'm willing to compromise further. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
