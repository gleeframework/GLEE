Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value and time sensitivity, which might encourage Bob to accept without much negotiation.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a different price depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale to Bob."
