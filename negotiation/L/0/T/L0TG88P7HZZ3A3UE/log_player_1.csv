Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too low, and I still have more negotiating room with Bob.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I need to stay closer to my desired price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
