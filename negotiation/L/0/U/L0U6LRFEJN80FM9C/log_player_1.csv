Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Bob's offer is too low, and while it's tempting to take the $7,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $8,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8500}
