"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $12000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable spending $10500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $10750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal at this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10750. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to stay above $11000. Let's try $11200. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my last offer. How about we settle on $10900? This price is fair for both of us, and we can close the deal.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10900. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10900 and $11200, which is $11050. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price.",11050.0,Alice,7,
