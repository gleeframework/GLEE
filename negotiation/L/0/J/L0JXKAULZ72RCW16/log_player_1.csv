Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it has great value for your business, and I'm confident it will generate a strong return on your investment. My asking price is $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and its potential to significantly benefit your company. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which is a good starting point. It's less than Bob's perceived value but still gives me a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits to Bob. This will hopefully encourage him to make a counteroffer closer to my asking price. 

**Why not start higher?**

While I could start at a higher price, it might scare Bob off completely. Starting a bit lower gives me room to negotiate and still secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This would still be a significant profit for you, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired $1,400,000 price point. 

I'm choosing to reject his offer and counter with my own, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on this product.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This would still represent a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique capabilities and potential benefits for your business."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value proposition of the product and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob's business. I'm also emphasizing the compromise I'm making by lowering my initial price.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain a negotiation stance:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a lower price easily.
* **Find common ground:** The halfway point represents a compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to move closer to my desired price. 
* **Show flexibility:** By acknowledging Bob's perspective and offering a lower price, I present myself as a reasonable negotiator."
