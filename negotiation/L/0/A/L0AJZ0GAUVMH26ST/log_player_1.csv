Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or a quick sale at a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $180 is a significant markup from your minimum but still within a reasonable range for Bob if he values the product. This tests his willingness to pay.
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and suggests the value of the product while being upfront about your offer. This encourages a response from Bob."
