"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
