"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our $10,000 limit.  We'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to stay below our $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $10,750 is still above our $10,000 limit. We're better off rejecting and countering again, aiming to get closer to $10,000 or deciding if it's time to go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I have a strict budget for this purchase. Would you be willing to consider $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're inching closer to our maximum by countering with $9,750. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but also establishes a firm upper limit. It's crucial to balance securing a good deal with the risk of Alice walking away, leaving us with John's $10,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear that $10,500 is her bottom line.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. We're better off accepting John's offer of $10,000 at this point.  We've managed to save $500 compared to Alice's final offer, which is a win."
