"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $14000. This is a special offer tailored to your needs and expectations. Please let me know if this aligns with your budget and considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob's maximum budget is $15,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice offers the product for $14,000.
* **Alternative:** Bob can buy from John for $15,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob can reject Alice's offer and get a slightly better deal from John, even though it's still at the edge of his budget."
