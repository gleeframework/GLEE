Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" aims to justify the high initial price, even though you know Bob values it less. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating you're ""open to hearing your thoughts"", you encourage Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation process.

**Goal:** 

Ideally, Bob will counter-offer with a price higher than $15,000, allowing you to secure a profit beyond your guaranteed sale to John. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum."
