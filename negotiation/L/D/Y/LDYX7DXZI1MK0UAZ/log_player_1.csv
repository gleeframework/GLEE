Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still above my minimum of $120 but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and while it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $120. I'm accepting the offer."
