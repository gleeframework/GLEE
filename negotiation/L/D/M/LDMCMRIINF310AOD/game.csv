"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $90. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $85. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $78, but that's really as high as I can go.",78.0,Bob,6,
