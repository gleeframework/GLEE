# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000.  This is a significant discount and a chance to acquire something truly unique. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for $10,000, saving him $2,000."
