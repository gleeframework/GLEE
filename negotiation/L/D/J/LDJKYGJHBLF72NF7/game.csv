"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial asking price. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $9,000 is better than your first offer, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,750?  This way, we both get a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll lower the price to $8,900. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",8900.0,Alice,5,
