"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for your needs. As we're getting started, I'd like to make an offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential use case. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects my use case.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 might be a bit high for your budget, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $6,000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $7,200. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. While $7,200 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find some middle ground. Would you be open to $6,500? I'm ready to make a deal if that works for you.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your offer of $6,500, I'm willing to counter with $6,800. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're really making me work for this, Alice, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $6,650?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",6650.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much on the price. Considering your offer of $6,650, I'm willing to counter with $6,750. This is a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.
