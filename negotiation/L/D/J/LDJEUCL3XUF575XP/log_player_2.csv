Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for your needs. As we're getting started, I'd like to make an offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential use case. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 might be a bit high for your budget, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $6,000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $7,200. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your offer of $6,500, I'm willing to counter with $6,800. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're really making me work for this, Alice, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $6,650?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much on the price. Considering your offer of $6,650, I'm willing to counter with $6,750. This is a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly holding firm at this point, and $6,750 is a good price.  It's not worth risking the deal by pushing further and potentially having to go with John."
