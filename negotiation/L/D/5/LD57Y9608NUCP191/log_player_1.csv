I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us. I hope he accepts this counteroffer."

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffers are getting lower. I'm not confident I can negotiate a better deal with him, so I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed sale and a fair price."
