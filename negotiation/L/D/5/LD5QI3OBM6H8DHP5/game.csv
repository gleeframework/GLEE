"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price, considering the value you'll get out of it.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
