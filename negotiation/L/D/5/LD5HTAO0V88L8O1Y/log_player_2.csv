"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $9,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,200. It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still above the product's worth to her ($8,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is still better off trying to get a lower price.  He might be able to secure a deal closer to his target of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,800. It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial target of $8,500 and significantly lower than the $10,000 he'd pay John.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a further negotiation breakdown."
