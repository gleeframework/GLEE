"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm aiming to spend less than $9,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,200. It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,800. It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,5,
