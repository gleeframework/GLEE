"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $10,750?  I'm confident this price is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a fair price that I hope we can agree on.",11250.0,Alice,5,
