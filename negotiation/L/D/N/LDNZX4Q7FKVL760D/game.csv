"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks valuable, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be a more reasonable starting point.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for being open to discussion. I understand your budget concerns, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my budget limitations.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $7,500 is still significantly lower than what I had in mind. To make this work, I could go down to $9,000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
