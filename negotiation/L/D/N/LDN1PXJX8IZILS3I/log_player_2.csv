"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than John's offer. There's room for negotiation, so it's best to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room for negotiation. It signals that we're serious buyers but also looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's position while firmly stating our price limit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer is closer to our walk-away price ($8,000 from John) but still gives Alice room to negotiate upwards.  We'll see how she responds and adjust our approach in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $8,500?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our acceptable price range, but we're still paying a premium over John's offer. There's a chance we can negotiate a slightly better deal with Alice, so we'll reject her current offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're moving closer to the midpoint between Alice's last offer and our previous counteroffer, signaling our willingness to compromise but also holding firm on getting a good deal.
* **Direct and Clear:** We're stating our desired price directly, avoiding ambiguity.
* **Time Constraint Implied:** We're not explicitly mentioning John's offer, but by sticking close to our budget, we're subtly reminding Alice that we have other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our bottom line. There's no longer any benefit to rejecting her offer, as it matches what we can get from John.  We've successfully negotiated the price down to our target!"
