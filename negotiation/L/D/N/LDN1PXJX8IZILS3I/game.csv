"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $8,500?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
