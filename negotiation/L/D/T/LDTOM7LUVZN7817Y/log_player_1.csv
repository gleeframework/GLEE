"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  I'm aiming high initially, significantly above both our valuations. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's high worth.
* **Justification:** My opening message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" and valuable nature, attempting to justify the high asking price.
* **Alternative Option:**  The safety net of John's offer allows me to be bolder in these early rounds. I'm not afraid to start high and potentially scare Bob off, as I have a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. Rejecting signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a drastically lower price. I'll use the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be open to discussing a price of $1,500,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've significantly reduced my price from the initial offer, signaling flexibility and a desire to close the deal.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $1,500,000 keeps the negotiation alive while still aiming for a price significantly above both our valuations. This leaves room for further compromise if needed.
* **Justification:** The message avoids directly rejecting Bob's offer, using phrases like ""appreciate your counteroffer"" to maintain a positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be open to discussing a price of $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,200,000.  However, I still believe I have leverage as we have plenty of rounds left and he is expressing a strong desire for the product. I'm willing to push him a little further before considering accepting his offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? This reflects my commitment to making this deal happen."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not drastically. This signals I'm serious about closing the deal but still value the product highly. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating my understanding of Bob's position and framing the compromise as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Time Pressure:** While we're only in Round 5, subtly introducing a sense of urgency could push Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Is that something we can discuss? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $1,250,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum. Accepting now secures a good return.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We're reaching a potential impasse. Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and further haggling might lead to resentment or a breakdown in communication. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds left, dragging out the negotiation has its own risks.  Securing the deal now eliminates uncertainty and allows me to move on."
