"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about the numbers.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that's not workable, I understand, but I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob has made it clear that $1,000,000 is his absolute limit. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  It's time to secure the guaranteed profit."
