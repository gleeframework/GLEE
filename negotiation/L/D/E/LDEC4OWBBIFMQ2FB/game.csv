"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about the numbers.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that's not workable, I understand, but I hope we can make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
