"Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
