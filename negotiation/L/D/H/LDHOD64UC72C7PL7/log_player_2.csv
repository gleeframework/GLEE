{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's much too early to accept Alice's offer.  $6,000 is a great price, but you have room to negotiate and potentially get it for even less.  By rejecting, you can explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about two-thirds of Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if Alice is willing to budge this early in the process."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved a little closer to my counteroffer, but $5,500 is still too high. I'm going to continue to push for a better price.  I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and I'm not in a hurry to buy from John just yet."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved a little closer, but $5,200 is still a bit high.  I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $4,800. This shows Alice that I'm getting closer to her offers, but still pushing for a lower price. We are now closer to finding a middle ground, and with several rounds still left, there's room for both of us to make concessions."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While $5,000 is still higher than my last counteroffer, it's within a reasonable range and getting closer to my target. With only a few rounds left, I'm not sure I can push for a lower price without risking losing the deal. I'm willing to accept $5,000 to secure the product before I have to buy from John for $15,000."
