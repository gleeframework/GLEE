"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That product looks great, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to let it go for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  While it's a great product, $100 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.
