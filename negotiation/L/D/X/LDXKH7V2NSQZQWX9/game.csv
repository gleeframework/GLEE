"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's try $10,500.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
