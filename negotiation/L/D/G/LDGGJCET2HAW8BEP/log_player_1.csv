Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any concerns."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,999 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This creates the impression of a deal while still ensuring a substantial profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation, suggesting I'm willing to discuss the price if Bob has objections. This keeps the conversation open and avoids immediately turning him away. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for maximizing my profit."
