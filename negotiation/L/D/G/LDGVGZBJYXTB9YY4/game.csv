"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to sell for $800,000.  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from owning it.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $750,000?  It's a fair price, and we can close this deal. ",750000.0,Alice,5,
