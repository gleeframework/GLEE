Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  I'm opening with the full value of the product to Bob.  This sets the baseline and allows for potential negotiation.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is concise and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
* **Option to Walk Away:**  By mentioning John, I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll either:
    * **Accept his counteroffer:** If he's willing to pay a price closer to $1,000,000.
    * **Reject his counteroffer:** If his price is too low, I'll make a new counteroffer, moving slightly down from my initial price.
    * **Sell to John:** If the negotiation stalls or Bob's offer is unacceptable, I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly less than the product's value to me ($1,000,000). 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While I'm not guaranteed a better offer, it's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob.  He's shown interest in the product, and I believe there's room for compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain some leverage and potentially get a price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between his initial offer and my initial asking price. I'll likely start at around $800,000 to see how he responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to sell for $800,000.  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from owning it."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him that $800,000 is still a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
    * **If he accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale closer to my desired price.
    * **If he rejects:**  I'll consider his counteroffer, keeping in mind that my target price is still $1,000,000.  If his offer is too low, I might choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $800,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** While Bob's offer of $700,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the $1,000,000 I believe the product is worth to me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer.  I believe I can push for a higher price with another counteroffer.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm still aiming for the best possible deal.  There's a chance I can get closer to my target price with continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $700,000 and $800,000. I'll likely start at $750,000 and see how he responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $750,000?  It's a fair price, and we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on Closing:** I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and end the negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer:
    * **If he accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale closer to my desired price.
    * **If he rejects:** I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or to sell to John. If I make another counteroffer, it will likely be my final offer, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
