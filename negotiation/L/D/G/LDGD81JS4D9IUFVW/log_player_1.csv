Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. I would like to counteroffer at $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000 if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,500?  This still gives you a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $13,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my desired price and is more than my minimum of $12,000. It's a good deal for me, and I want to avoid the risk of Bob walking away or me needing to sell to John for a lower price."
