Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know it's worth a significant amount more to you. Let's work together to make this a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal happen. It's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to your business. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me at $880,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $880,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better deal with Bob.  We're closer than before, and I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $880,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work.  Let's compromise at $890,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $880,000 and $890,000, which would be $885,000. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  I'm only $5,000 away from Bob's initial offer, and with only four rounds left, there's a risk that I might not be able to get a better price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
