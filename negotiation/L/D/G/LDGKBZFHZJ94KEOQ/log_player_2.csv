# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

We can try to negotiate a better price with Alice since her offer is higher than your target."

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",

This counter-offer attempts to move the price significantly closer to my target while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $82. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll counter-offer again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."

{

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as high as $75. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $84. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging significantly, and her final offer of $84 is too close to John's price of $100. It's unlikely further negotiation with Alice will yield a significantly better price.  Therefore, it makes more sense to buy from John for $100 and avoid further back-and-forth."
