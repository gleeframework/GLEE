Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I consider fair given the product's unique nature and potential.  Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000? This feels like a more reasonable compromise.
