{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's also above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a profit.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, giving me the chance to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $145? That's still a great deal for you and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm aiming to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer is still above my minimum but offers a discount for Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, $135 is still below it. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a price lower than my minimum.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and saves time and energy."
