"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $145? That's still a great deal for you and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.  What do you think?",135.0,Bob,4,
