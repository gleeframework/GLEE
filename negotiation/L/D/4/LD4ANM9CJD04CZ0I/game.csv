"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $180 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $160. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway at $160, and going down to $130 is a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $145? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
