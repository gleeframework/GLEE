"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a negotiation and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $160. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $160 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my maximum of $120.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get Alice closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway at $160, and going down to $130 is a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $145? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While I appreciate her willingness to compromise, I've already gone as high as I can with my counteroffers.  It's more beneficial for me to buy from John at $120.  This ensures I get the product within my budget."
