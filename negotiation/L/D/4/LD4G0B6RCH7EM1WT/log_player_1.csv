Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This seems like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than his current offer of $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
