"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to make you a one-time offer on this exclusive product, Bob. I think you'll really appreciate its value and I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a much better deal from John at $800,000."
