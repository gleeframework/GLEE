"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me right now.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $900,000? It's a significant investment on my part, and I believe it acknowledges the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a significant investment. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This price takes into account your desire for a more budget-friendly option, while still acknowledging the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
