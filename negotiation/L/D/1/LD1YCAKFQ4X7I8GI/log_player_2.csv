# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a significant investment. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This price takes into account your desire for a more budget-friendly option, while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice seems unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, potentially ending up with a worse deal. Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees the best price."
