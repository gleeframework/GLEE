"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but unfortunately, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the current market value of similar products.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000. I'm confident that the product's value will be worth it to you in the long run. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the product's current market value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. While I see the value in the product, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,500, which is a reasonable compromise and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
