"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but unfortunately, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000. I'm confident that the product's value will be worth it to you in the long run. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the product's current market value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still above his target.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. While I see the value in the product, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,500, which is a reasonable compromise and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been negotiating for a while and it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $11,000.  This is still above Bob's budget, and he has only 3 rounds left. It's time to take the safe route and buy the product from John for $8,000.  This guarantees him the product at a price he's comfortable with, and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
