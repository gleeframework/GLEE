"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum, you want to save as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, giving you ample opportunity to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, given its value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  A $15 reduction from Alice's offer shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Be reasonable:** $95 is still a decent profit for Alice, and a good savings for you. 
* **Stay within your budget:** This offer keeps you below your $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.**  While it's a compromise, you're still aiming for a better price.
* **There's room for further negotiation.** You have multiple rounds left, and it's worth trying to get closer to your target price. 
* **You can still afford to wait:** Buying from John is your backup option, but you want to exhaust the negotiation with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:** This offer is exactly halfway between your previous offer ($95) and Alice's offer ($105). This shows you're willing to compromise and signals a genuine desire to close the deal.
* **Maintain a good profit margin for Alice:** $100 is still a decent profit for Alice, given her valuation of $80. 
* **Stay within your budget:** This offer keeps you within your $120 limit."
