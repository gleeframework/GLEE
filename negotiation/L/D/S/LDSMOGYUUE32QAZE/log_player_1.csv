"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's valued at $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some wiggle room in the negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price feels a bit high to me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $85? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. I'm still interested, but I'd need it to be closer to $75 to make it work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  There's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but I can't go lower than $80. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 80}
