Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to settle at a price still profitable for you.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** $145 is just below your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you still make a good profit if Bob accepts.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes value and time sensitivity, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price, giving Bob a chance to feel involved in the process.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$150 or higher:**  While this is your ideal price, it's unlikely Bob will accept since it's above his perceived value. 
* **$120 - $130:** This range is too close to Bob's perceived value and leaves little room for negotiation or profit if he tries to haggle. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob an attractive enough deal to consider."
