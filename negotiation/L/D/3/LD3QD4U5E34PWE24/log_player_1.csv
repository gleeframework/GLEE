Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible without risking a rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's inclined, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  A price too close to $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
