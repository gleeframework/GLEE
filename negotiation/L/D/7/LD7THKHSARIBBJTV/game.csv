"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160, which would be $140. Would you be open to that?",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $140, which would be $150. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
