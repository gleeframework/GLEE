"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at your maximum price point.  There's no benefit to accepting her offer. Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, you might as well reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a better deal with her later or find another seller."
