"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the current market. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
