,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price given the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not ready to give up on the price just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $890,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale at this price.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $890,000 is a good number, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $875,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this deal right now.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and offer it to you for $882,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best deal for both of us.",882500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're nearly there. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $882,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to finalize the deal right now at $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Bob,8,
