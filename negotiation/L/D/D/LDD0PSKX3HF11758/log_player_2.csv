# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always better to try and negotiate a better price.  $1,400,000 is still above your target of $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?

While $1,350,000 is still above your target, it's a reasonable compromise. You're getting a better price than Alice's original offer, and it's still within a range you're willing to pay."
