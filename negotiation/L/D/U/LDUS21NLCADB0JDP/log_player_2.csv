Alice's offer is too high. The product is only worth $12,000 to you, and you can always get it from John at that price. It's time to negotiate!"

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price that's a good deal for us. Let's counter again, pushing closer to our target price."

Alice is holding firm at a price that's still above our maximum. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and it's not worth the risk of losing the product altogether. We have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000, so it's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
