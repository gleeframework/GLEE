"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay, but I'm open to discussion. Let's start with a price of $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards. It also signals that we're serious about buying but need a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I would like to counter with a price of $75 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still within your budget. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, which is good. Let's see if we can push a little further.  We're still closer to our target price than hers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $68?"",
""product_price"": 68
}
``` 

We're getting closer!  This offer shows Alice we are willing to compromise, but still want a price significantly lower than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your offer, I'd like to suggest a price of $72 for the product. It's a bit higher than your proposal but still reasonable. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close, but this is a good time to remind Alice that we have other options. We're only $8 away from John's price, and Alice may be more willing to negotiate if she knows we might walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's closer to what I had in mind, Alice, but to be completely honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80.  If you can do $70, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This message does a few things:

* **Positive reinforcement:** We start by acknowledging Alice's movement and keeping the tone positive.
* **Introducing competition:**  We subtly mention the alternative option without being too aggressive.  This might encourage Alice to be more flexible.
* **Clear target:**  We give a firm counter-offer that's attractive but still below our walk-away point.

It's a bit of a gamble, but with time running out, it's worth seeing if Alice will bite."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I'm willing to accept a price of $75 for the product. This is slightly above your last offer but still a fair compromise. I hope you'll find this acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice doesn't seem willing to budge below $75. It's time to cut our losses and go with John.  We've negotiated well, but it's not worth overpaying when we have a guaranteed alternative at $80."
