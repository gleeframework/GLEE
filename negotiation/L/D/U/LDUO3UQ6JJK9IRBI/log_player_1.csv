Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's maximum valuation is $1,200,000, we don't want to start too low.  There's always a chance he might be willing to negotiate up slightly.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the fact that Alice has other buyers lined up. This creates a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down.  If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can still lower the price slightly and remain above her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Time Constraint:** Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
