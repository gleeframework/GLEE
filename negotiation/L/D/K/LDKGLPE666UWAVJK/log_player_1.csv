Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $12,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, justifying the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in discussion and potentially counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.
* While aiming high, be mindful of not alienating Bob with an unreasonably high price."
