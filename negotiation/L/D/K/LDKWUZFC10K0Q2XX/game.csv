"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $22000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counter-counteroffer of $18000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counter-counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $15000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $17000. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to hold firm on the price. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $17000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
