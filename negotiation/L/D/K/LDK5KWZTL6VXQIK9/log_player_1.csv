{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This price gives Bob a good starting point for counter-offers, while still allowing me to make a decent profit.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've made a good sale.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's close to my minimum) or make a counter-offer of my own.  If the negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and far below my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting would result in a huge loss.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  I can make a counter-offer that is closer to my desired price range.  This allows for continued negotiation and potentially a more favorable outcome.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer. However, I want to explore if I can get closer to my minimum price with Bob before I give up.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum but still recognizing Bob's lower budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counter-offer of $9,000 is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal even at $9,000.  
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm not completely closing the door to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $9,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Waiting for Bob's Response:** I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my counter-offer or makes another counter-offer.
* **Prepared for Other Outcomes:** If Bob rejects my offer again, I can either make another counter-offer, or I'll go ahead and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  While it's a bit closer, it's not enough to make the sale worthwhile.
* **Further Negotiation Potential:** I can still make another counter-offer and try to get closer to my desired price. There's still room for negotiation before I have to consider selling to John.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'm not completely willing to give up on getting a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum but still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.  I'll need to weigh the potential of a higher offer from Bob against the certainty of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $8,500.  This would allow me to make the sale while still giving you a significant discount. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** My counter-offer of $8,500 is closer to Bob's offer of $7,500 but still above my minimum of $15,000. This shows a commitment to negotiation while staying firm on my bottom line.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm highlighting the fact that I'm already making a concession, hoping to encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Calculating Risk:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is still an option, but I'm hoping that Bob might accept this offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Waiting for Bob's Response:** I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my counter-offer or makes another counter-offer. 
* **Decision Time:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. The risk of further negotiation is increasing, as the potential for a better price from Bob is diminishing."
