Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $8,500.  This would allow me to make the sale while still giving you a significant discount. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees the best price."
