The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now. I'm prepared to offer $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
