"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now. I'm prepared to offer $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
