Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value while still giving you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome than my absolute minimum.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $14,000 is still below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message indicates I'm open to negotiation, which helps keep the conversation going. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I'm maximizing my chances of getting a price closer to my ideal outcome while still being open to finding a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my ideal price.**  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still not ideal.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. There's room to meet in the middle.
* **Avoiding the minimum:** Selling to John for $12,000 would be a last resort. I want to maximize my profit if possible. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation going and potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is the midpoint between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to agree.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation friendly and constructive.

By proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum, I'm increasing the chances of reaching an agreement and maximizing my profit."
