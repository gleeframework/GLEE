Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, aiming to maximize profit. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm hoping to gauge his interest with this initial offer. If he rejects, I'll adjust accordingly while keeping in mind John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I want to see if I can do better.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to his valuation.  I believe this price might be tempting enough for him to accept, while still allowing me to earn more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could counter again, there's a good chance he'll continue to lower his offer. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a more secure and acceptable outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob."
