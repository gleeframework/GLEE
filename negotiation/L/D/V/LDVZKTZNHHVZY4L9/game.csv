"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000.  Let's find a middle ground to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. I'm still not comfortable with $775,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers at $812,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good outcome.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, compromise is key. To make this happen quickly, I'm willing to offer $790,000.  That's a significant jump on my end, and I'm hoping we can close the deal with this.",790000.0,Bob,6,
