Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price to see if Bob is willing to pay it.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $750,000. Since this is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob to try to get closer to my minimum acceptable price.
