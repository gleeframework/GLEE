Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $600,000 is too far below my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it gives me some room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $720,000 just isn't feasible for me.  Let's try $800,000. This would be a win-win for both of us â€“ you'd get a fantastic product at a competitive price, and I'd get a fair return on my investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

This is the best option for several reasons:

* **Matches Your Limit:** Alice's offer of $800,000 perfectly aligns with the maximum you're willing to pay.
* **Better Than John:** While you could buy from John for the same price, there's no guarantee of getting a better deal elsewhere.
* **Saves Time & Effort:** Accepting now avoids further negotiation rounds and potential deadlocks.

While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might withdraw the offer, leaving you with only John's option."
