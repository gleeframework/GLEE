Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $18,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.

To be completely transparent, I can get a similar product for $15,000 elsewhere. I'm willing to offer you $14,000 for yours, as I do see some unique benefits. If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore my other option."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have options, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell for $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $18,000, which is $16,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'll meet you at $15,500. That's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.

It's time to walk away.  Alice is very unlikely to go below her cost, and you've already revealed your backup plan. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
