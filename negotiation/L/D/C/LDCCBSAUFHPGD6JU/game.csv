"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $600,000.  I think this is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of the product, but $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $725,000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",725000.0,Alice,5,
