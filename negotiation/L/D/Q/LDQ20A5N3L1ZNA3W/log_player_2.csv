# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to exceed your expectations. This product holds significant value to me due to its unique features and the time invested in its development. Considering its worth to me, I am extending an exclusive offer to you. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $12,000? This price reflects the balance between my investment and the perceived value to you, aiming to be mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice's product might be fantastic, $12,000 is significantly more than your $8,000 budget and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. By rejecting this offer, you can move to your backup plan and secure a better deal."
