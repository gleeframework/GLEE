(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you being willing to sell it to me. However, $150 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A lower counteroffer (significantly below your maximum) increases the chance of a successful negotiation.

* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages a collaborative approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my budget of $120.  While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $130 is still a bit too much for me right now.  How about $125? I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing my interest in the product.
* **Fairness Argument:** I'm framing my offer as fair for both of us, appealing to Alice's sense of reason."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $128. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my budget of $120. Although it's tempting to accept given it's close to my maximum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to counter-offer one more time before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate you coming down in price. $128 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $124?  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 124}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Approach:**  I'm suggesting a ""split the difference"" solution, emphasizing a collaborative approach.
* **Fairness Argument:** I'm framing my offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping a positive tone, demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $124 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $126. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $126
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $126 is still above my budget of $120.  While it's tempting to accept, I've already countered several times, and there's a high chance she will not accept my next offer. Given that I have limited rounds remaining, and John offers the product for my target price, it's wiser to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
