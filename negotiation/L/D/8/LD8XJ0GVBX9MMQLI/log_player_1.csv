Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000. 
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Negotiation space:**  We have a significant negotiation space of $7,000.
* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a high starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but it's still significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Strategic advantage:** By starting high, I create pressure on Bob to make a counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his willingness to pay and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next steps:** 

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John. 
* I will always have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  While Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still far below what I'm aiming for.
* **My goal:** My goal is to maximize my earnings, and $11,000 is significantly less than my target of at least $15,000. 
* **Negotiation space:** We still have a negotiation space of $4,000, which is significant enough to justify further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.  
* I will keep the option to sell to John for $15,000 in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 was rejected, indicating he's willing to pay more.
* **My goal:** My goal is to reach a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.
* **Finding middle ground:**  I'm offering $12,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will assess his counteroffer and potentially adjust my strategy.
* If Bob accepts, I will successfully sell the product for a price that is above his initial offer.
* If negotiations fail, I can always sell the product to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's counteroffer of $10,500 is further away from my target price than my previous offer of $12,000. This suggests that he is not willing to negotiate much higher.
* **My goal:** My goal is to maximize my earnings, and $10,500 is still significantly less than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Risk vs. reward:** While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer.  Selling to John guarantees me the maximum price I'm aiming for. 

**Next steps:**

* Selling to John provides me with certainty and a much more favorable outcome compared to the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
