# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?

While $14,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You can try to negotiate further or buy from John."
