"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we've discussed, the product is worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $12,000. It's the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
