{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to potentially earn more than $120 from John, but also allows for flexibility if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too far off. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $65 is probably too low. How about $75? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. I'm going to reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85, which I think is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
