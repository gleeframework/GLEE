"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  I think you'll find it's a very fair price for what it can do for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's too early to accept, and you have much room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** We start with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Justification:**  We provide a reason for our counteroffer (budget limitations) to make it seem more genuine.
* **Room to Compromise:**  The $10,000 offer provides Alice with room to negotiate down from her price but keeps us within a range we're willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's a fantastic product that I know you'll benefit from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my budget, even though she has come down from her original asking price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet ready to accept anything over $8,000.  I will continue negotiating in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. If you're serious about selling, let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but only slightly, showing that we're serious about buying but still have a budget constraint.
* **Focus on Bridging the Gap:** We emphasize our willingness to compromise, suggesting that a deal is within reach.
* **Maintain Pressure:** By indicating that we're ready to walk away if the price isn't right, we keep the pressure on Alice to make a more reasonable offer."
