"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and its worth to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we try $10,000? That's a significant price for me, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, so I'm offering you $11,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
