"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to counter with a price that's still attractive to Bob but also more beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $900,000. Considering the value this product offers you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make a deal before we run out of time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still secure a better deal.  I'll counter with a price that's still within Bob's range, but closer to my desired profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we're getting closer to agreement. Let's finalize this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I'd prefer a slightly higher price,  $950,000 is a good outcome considering my minimum acceptable price and the fact that I'm not guaranteed a better deal with John."
