"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that to me, and I'm confident it will be worth even more to you in the long run.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to make a substantial profit.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
