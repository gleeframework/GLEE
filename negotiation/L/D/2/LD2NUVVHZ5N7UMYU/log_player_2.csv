"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've given it a lot of thought, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than your maximum price of $1,200,000.
* Accepting Alice's offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, the offer is already very favorable."
