"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's try $825,000. This is a compromise that should be more palatable to both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I'm not budging any further. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at last.",825000.0,Alice,7,
