Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
``` 

This offer is a strategic compromise.  

* **It's higher than my floor:**  $1,450,000 is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This incentivizes Bob to consider the deal.
* **It's lower than Bob's valuation:** $1,450,000 is less than the $1,500,000 Bob values the product at, giving him a potential profit and making the offer attractive. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a higher price than John's offer while still keeping the deal appealing to Bob."
