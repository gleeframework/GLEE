"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $12,000. This is a steal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for significantly less from John ($8,000). Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open with Alice and allows you to pursue the better deal."
