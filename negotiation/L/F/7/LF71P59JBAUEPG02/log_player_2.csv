{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:** Starting with a lower price shows your seriousness and leaves room for compromise.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice.

**Next Steps:** You should make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your target."

* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  

**Next Steps:**  You should make another counteroffer, but be prepared to accept John's offer if Alice doesn't come down to your desired price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is your maximum budget, and it shows Alice you're serious about closing the deal.
* **Matching John's price:**  This makes it a direct comparison for Alice. If she wants to sell to you, she has to beat John's price. 
* **Putting pressure on Alice:** If she rejects this offer, she risks losing the sale to John.

**Next Steps:** This is a high-stakes offer.  Depending on Alice's response, you may want to consider buying from John if the negotiation continues to stall."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** While it's a significant improvement, it's still not ideal.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  You've reached your maximum budget with your counteroffer. John offers a guaranteed price within your budget.
* **Time is running out:** With only 3 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating, especially with no guarantee Alice will come down further.

**Next Steps:** Buying from John is the most sensible option in this situation. It guarantees you the product at a price you're comfortable with, and there's no risk of the deal falling apart."
