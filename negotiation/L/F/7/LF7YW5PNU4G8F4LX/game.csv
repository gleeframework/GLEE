"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise further. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,175,000. This price allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
