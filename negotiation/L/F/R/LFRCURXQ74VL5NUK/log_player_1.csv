Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects that."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to settle for anything less than $8,000.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product."
