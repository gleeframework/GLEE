"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. My final offer is $900,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to move forward with another option.",900000.0,Bob,4,
