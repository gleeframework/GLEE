"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,250 is better than John's price, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price with Alice."
