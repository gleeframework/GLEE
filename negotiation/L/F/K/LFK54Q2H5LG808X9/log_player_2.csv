It's highly likely that Alice is willing to sell for a lower price than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to signal my willingness to negotiate and see how much flexibility Alice has.  It's also within my budget, so I have room to increase the offer if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price range.  However, I'm still aiming for a better deal. I'm going to continue to negotiate, hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  It's still early in the negotiation, and there's a good chance I can get a lower price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product.  $4,000 is still within my budget, and it's a significant jump from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  I'm hoping that this will be a good enough offer for Alice to accept."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and we are now very close.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and with only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  $4,750 is still within my budget, and it's a decent saving compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of running out of time."
