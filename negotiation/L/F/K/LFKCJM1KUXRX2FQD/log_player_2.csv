"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $950,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum budget, it still leaves you paying $150,000 more than Alice values the product.
* **John's offer is your fallback.** You're guaranteed to get the product for $1,000,000, which is within your budget.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate with her further or potentially find a better deal elsewhere.**  By rejecting, you signal that you're not desperate and have other options, which could encourage Alice to lower her price. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the most strategic move."
