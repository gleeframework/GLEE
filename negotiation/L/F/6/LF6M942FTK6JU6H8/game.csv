"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing your product for $800,000. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $900,000. I would like to propose $850,000 as a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not comfortable with $875,000, I'd like to propose $860,000 as a counteroffer. This price reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,6,
