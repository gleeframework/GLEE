Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, holding out for the full $1,000,000 from John is the best move at this point. It eliminates further negotiation and guarantees the maximum return."
