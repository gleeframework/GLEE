"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $100.  I'm sure you'll still make a profit, and I'll get the product at a price I can afford.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $100. I'm willing to give you a slight concession and offer it to you for $102. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
