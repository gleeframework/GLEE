"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to anchor you to a $1,200,000 valuation. However, you know you can get the product for that price from John. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that her price is too high. 
* There's a chance Alice will come back with a lower offer closer to her own valuation of $800,000, allowing you to save even more money."
