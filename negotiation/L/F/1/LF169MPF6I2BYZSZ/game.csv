"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a great deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,150,000 is closer, but I still can't quite meet that price. How about $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,112,500?  That's a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let me know what you think.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I could potentially do $1,100,000. I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
