"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is still a little lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that we both walk away happy with the deal. ",125.0,Alice,5,
