Bob is offering the minimum he's willing to pay, and I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."

Bob is insistent on his $100 price, and I'm starting to run out of time.  I'd rather not risk losing any more time with him.  John is a guaranteed sale at $100, which is my minimum."
