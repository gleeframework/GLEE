"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly higher than what I could get from another seller. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
