"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price below its true worth, and I get a quick sale.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,000,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly higher than what I could get from another seller. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and avoid further back-and-forth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $875,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $800,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further.  This could lead to a prolonged negotiation and potentially lose the deal with John.
* **Accepting the offer secures the product:** This is a good price for Bob, and he should secure the product before potentially losing it to John or Alice raising her price again."
