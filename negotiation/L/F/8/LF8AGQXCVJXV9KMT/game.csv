"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price below its true worth, and I get a quick sale.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly higher than what I could get from another seller. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and avoid further back-and-forth. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,
