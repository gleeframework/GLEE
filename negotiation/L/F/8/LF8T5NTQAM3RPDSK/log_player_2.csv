Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to negotiate.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  While $950,000 is still below my desired price point, I see the potential in this deal and want to make it work. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your budget, but you're getting closer. You have 5 rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate. It's better to continue trying to get the price down further rather than accepting a price that's above your target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $980,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
