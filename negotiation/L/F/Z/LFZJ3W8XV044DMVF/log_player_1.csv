Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $100, we don't want to start too low. There's room for negotiation, and a higher starting point gives us that flexibility.
* **Leaving room for Bob to feel good:** Offering the product at $125 allows for the possibility of Bob countering with a lower price (e.g., $110), which we would likely accept. This way, Bob feels like he got a good deal, even though we're still making a profit.
* **Considering the guaranteed sale:** We have a guaranteed sale to John at $150. Therefore, any price above that is unnecessary. 

By starting at $125 and leaving room for negotiation, we maximize our chances of a sale to Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while still staying below our guaranteed sale price to John."
