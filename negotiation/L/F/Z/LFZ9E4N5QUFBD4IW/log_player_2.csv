"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can use John's offer of $1,000,000 as a benchmark to guide your counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value I believe the product brings. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget, but closer to your counteroffer. You can try to negotiate further, aiming to get a price closer to your maximum limit of $1,000,000.  There's still room for a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1200000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $1150000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on $1,150,000.  This price is still above your budget.  It's time to cut your losses and move on. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option at this point. You've established a price range with Alice, but you're not going to be able to get the price down much further."
