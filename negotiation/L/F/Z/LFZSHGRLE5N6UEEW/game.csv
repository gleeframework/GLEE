"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a compromise: I'll meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit away from what I can afford. How about $760,000? This offer reflects the serious interest I have in your product while staying within my budget.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $760,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, bringing the price down to $795,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting your budget without compromising my own profit margin. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
