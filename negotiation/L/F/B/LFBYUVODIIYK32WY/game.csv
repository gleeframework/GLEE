"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see the value in this product, $1,900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given its worth to me, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  I've had significant interest in this product, and I know its true value is higher than your current offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
