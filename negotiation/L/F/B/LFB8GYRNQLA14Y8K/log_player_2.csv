"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the product with you, Bob! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum price and what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John at a lower price."
