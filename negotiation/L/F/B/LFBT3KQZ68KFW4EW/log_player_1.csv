``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above what Bob is willing to pay, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal open for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the deal.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to push Bob a little closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $102.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my price, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that's still below my minimum.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, and that's a much better deal for me."
