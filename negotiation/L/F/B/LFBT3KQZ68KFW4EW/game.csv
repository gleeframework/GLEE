"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $102.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",102.5,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but $102.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $97.50 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",97.5,Bob,6,
