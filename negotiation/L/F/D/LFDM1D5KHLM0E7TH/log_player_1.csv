{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob might be willing to pay more. This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit too pricey for me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about we settle at $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great deal for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  Let's try $90. It's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price and still leaves me with a profit.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a sale to John at $80."
