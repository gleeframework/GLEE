Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob might counter. This will give me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  I'm also aware that I can always go to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer to $1,200,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant amount higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough to make it worthwhile for me to continue negotiating. It's becoming clear that Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway, and I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer who will pay my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and it's time to secure that."
