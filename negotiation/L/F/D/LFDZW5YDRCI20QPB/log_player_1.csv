"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident that the product's value to Bob justifies this price, but I'm also leaving room for bargaining. I'm keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, it's still higher than John's offer. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Bob. I believe there's still room for compromise.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $900,000 without risking a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product to you while giving me a fair return. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's still higher than John's offer but lower than my initial offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on. I'm also emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'd like, but it's closer to my target price. I'm going to reject this offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure.  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further before considering selling to John. I'm hoping I can get to at least $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to meet my needs. Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm trying to close the deal by offering a compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price.  This is still significantly higher than John's offer, but it's getting close to my minimum price point.  I'm emphasizing the need to ""finalize"" the deal, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there.  The negotiation is getting tense, and I'm concerned we might not reach an agreement. With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I need to secure the deal.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and ensures I don't lose out entirely. 

Therefore, I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
