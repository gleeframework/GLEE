# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to me is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

It's not worth continuing negotiations with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $8,500, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  You maximize your savings by going with John."
