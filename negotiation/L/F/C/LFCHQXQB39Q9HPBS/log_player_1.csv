Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, and Bob might accept the initial offer.
* **Justification:** While I don't want to reveal my absolute bottom price, implying the product's value is higher (""worth a lot"") can make Bob more amenable to a price above his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects $180, I can always come down a bit. Since I have John as a backup, I'm not desperate, but I still want to maximize my potential profit."
