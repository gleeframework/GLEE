"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. How about $7500? Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8200? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8200 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $8000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $8100? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",8100.0,Alice,5,
