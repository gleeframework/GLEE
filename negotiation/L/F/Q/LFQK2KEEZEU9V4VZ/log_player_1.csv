"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly opening:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage a positive response.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm suggesting the product is valuable to entice Bob. 
* **Asking for feedback:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation by asking for his thoughts. 

This strategy aims to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* Set the tone for a collaborative negotiation. 
* Create a sense of urgency by leaving the possibility of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is above my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to continue negotiating. This will likely lead to more counteroffers, potentially resulting in a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:**  I'm showing respect for Bob's counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum. 
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further discussion by asking ""What do you say?"".

This strategy aims to: 
* Show flexibility while still maintaining a strong negotiating position. 
* Keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* Explore whether Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. Can you consider $15000? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Given that we're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely, I'm choosing to accept his offer. This ensures I get a decent price, albeit not my ideal one, and avoid the potential risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or losing the sale to John."
