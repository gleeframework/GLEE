Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the guaranteed best price from John."
