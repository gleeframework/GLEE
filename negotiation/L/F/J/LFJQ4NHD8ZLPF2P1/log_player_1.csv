Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise: 

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000),** making it potentially appealing to him.
* **It's lower than your minimum value ($15,000),** ensuring you still make a profit.

This strategy increases the chance of Bob accepting, as he's getting a potential deal, while still guaranteeing you a sale and a reasonable profit should he decline."
