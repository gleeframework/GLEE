{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring options. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for potential negotiation and a lower price. There's no harm in seeing if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (25%) shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating.  This price is still within your budget and gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to continue pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've already established that Alice is willing to come down from her initial price.  This counteroffer is a compromise -  it's higher than our previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  This shows we're serious about a deal but aren't afraid to walk away if it doesn't meet our needs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a good price, we're still in a strong negotiating position with 5 rounds left. Rejecting allows us to potentially secure a price closer to our original target of $900,000.  We can also assess if Alice is showing a pattern of decreasing her offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently lowered her price.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from our previous offer, showing that we are willing to compromise, but still below her last offer. It puts the pressure on Alice to decide whether to close the deal or risk us walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has steadily lowered her price, and her offer of $1,020,000 is within a reasonable range.  We've reached the 7th round, so accepting this offer secures the product and saves us $180,000 compared to buying from John. There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings might not be substantial enough to warrant the risk of further rounds."
