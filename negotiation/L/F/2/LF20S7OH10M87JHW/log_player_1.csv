Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product's value might be even higher than Bob initially thought. 
* **Anchoring:** This initial high price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if it's significantly higher than his valuation, it can influence his counteroffers to be more favorable to you.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer. This gives you leverage in the negotiation, as you don't *need* to sell to Bob below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 suggests he values the product significantly, even though it's below your minimum. There's room for negotiation.
* **Target Price:** You should aim to get closer to your $1,200,000 minimum. Accepting $1,000,000 would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table.
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you a strong position. You don't have to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It seems we both see the value in this product. To be fair, my original asking price was a bit ambitious.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial proposal and recognizes your interest."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** By significantly lowering your price from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and make a deal. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting it as a ""significant discount"" frames the new offer favorably.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still aiming high, well above both Bob's offer and your absolute minimum. The goal is to bring him closer to your target while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches your absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has skillfully negotiated, getting you to move significantly from your initial offer. 
* **No Benefit to Delay:** You have a guaranteed buyer at this price (John). While pushing for more is tempting, there's a risk Bob could walk away, and you'd get the same amount from John anyway.  

It's a good deal, and it makes sense to accept."
