"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you. Our initial offer for the product is $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than Alice's original value of $1,000,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can start negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is a significant discount from your original price and reflects the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway. We're willing to consider your offer, but we need to adjust the price slightly. Our counteroffer for the product is $875,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. However, it's significantly closer to his ideal price.  Given that Bob only has 10 rounds to close the deal, accepting this offer gives him a good deal without risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or the loss of the product to John."
