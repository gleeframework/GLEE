{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I believe you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Would you be interested in an offer of $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that leaves room for potential compromise, while still reflecting the product's value to me.  It's a good starting point, as I can adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is too low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $17,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it still reflects the value of this unique product."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop below $15,000.  John is a guaranteed buyer at that price, so I'll choose to sell to him."
