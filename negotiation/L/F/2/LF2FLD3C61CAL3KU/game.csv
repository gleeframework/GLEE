"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,875. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,875 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
