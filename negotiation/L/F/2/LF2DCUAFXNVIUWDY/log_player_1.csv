**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offers, we are still significantly above Jhon's offer.  It seems unlikely Bob will reach a satisfactory price in the remaining rounds. We'll push a little harder, but need to be ready to walk away and take Jhon's offer soon."

**Reasoning:**  Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and it's still significantly below what Jhon is offering. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome than taking Jhon's guaranteed $1,000,000."
