"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $6,000, Alice. While $9,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000 to try and find a compromise.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
