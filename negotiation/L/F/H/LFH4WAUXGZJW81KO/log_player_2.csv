# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $175 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $100. He should attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a discounted rate. Let me know if you're interested!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $145 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think!
