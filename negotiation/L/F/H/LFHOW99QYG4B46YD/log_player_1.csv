"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and we can close the deal quickly. However, I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me at a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my target price, I still believe I can get closer to $10,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,800. This is a small decrease from my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product to him, but also that I'm not willing to give it away for less than its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's clear that Bob isn't willing to go much higher. Selling for $9,600 is still a good profit, and it's better than risking a further reduction in the next round or selling to John for less."
