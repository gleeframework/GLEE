"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a great product for you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a fantastic price. If you're not interested, I can always sell it to someone else for $150, but I'd rather give you the opportunity to buy it first. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. Rejecting this offer allows you to move to your best option and maximize your savings."
