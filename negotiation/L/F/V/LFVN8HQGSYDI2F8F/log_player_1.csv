Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's worth to both of us. I believe it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $90, it's below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value and our previous negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $98 is close to my minimum threshold, I'm going to sell to John for $100.  The negotiation with Bob has taken time, and John's offer guarantees me my minimum profit.  It's a safer bet to secure a guaranteed sale."
