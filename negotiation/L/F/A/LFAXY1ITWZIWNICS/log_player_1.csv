``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to be prepared to justify the value of the product to Bob.  The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $15,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I believe this price still reflects the value of the product while being a fair offer for you."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $14,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $14,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000.  It's better to secure a known value than risk further negotiation with Bob."
