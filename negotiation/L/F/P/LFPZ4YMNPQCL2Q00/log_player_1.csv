"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Rationale:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher sale price.
* **Strong Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's unique value to entice Bob.
* **Open Invitation:** I invite Bob to discuss and provide his perspective. 
* **No Threat:** I don't mention John or the fallback option yet.  

This initial offer is aggressive but it sets the stage for a negotiation where I can adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to secure a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially reach a better deal.
* **Assessing Bob's Willingness:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how serious Bob is about acquiring the product.

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer that aims to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to my minimum, I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This allows for a fair deal while still ensuring a profitable transaction for me."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize a ""fair deal"" and ""profitable transaction,"" reminding Bob of the value proposition.
* **Specific Price:**  I offer a clear and specific price, pushing the negotiation forward.

I'm trying to strike a balance between securing a decent price and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I would like to propose a price of $1025000. I hope this aligns better with our mutual interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my desired price range.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, or even a stalemate.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob increases.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point. It secures a good price and reduces the risk of a less favorable outcome."
