"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for concessions while anchoring the discussion around a higher value.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting above his perceived value creates the potential for him to negotiate upwards, potentially closer to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Below Your Minimum:** The offer is significantly lower than your $1,200,000 safety net (selling to John), ensuring you have bargaining power.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of room for negotiation and rounds left. Rejecting his offer signals that you're looking for a more substantial offer and keeps the door open for further discussion."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you presenting your perspective. I understand your budget considerations, however, the value this product brings to the table is truly substantial.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by making a significant concession of $50,000 from your initial offer.
* **Above Midpoint:** The new price is strategically positioned slightly above the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, encouraging him to move closer to your desired range.
* **Reinforce Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, reminding Bob of the benefits he'd be getting while justifying the higher price point. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:** While the tone is collaborative, the offer maintains firmness and doesn't concede too much too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer only increased by $50,000, indicating slow progress towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Below Minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leverage Time:** You have enough rounds remaining to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about obtaining a higher price while still allowing for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  Let's bridge the gap. How about we settle on $1,020,000?  This reflects my strong desire to reach a deal while recognizing the significant value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1020000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** You're reducing your concession size to $30,000, signaling that you're approaching your desired price range.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The new price is strategically positioned just above the midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, encouraging him to make a more significant move.
* **Emphasis on Closing:**  The message highlights your ""strong desire to reach a deal,"" subtly adding a sense of urgency while maintaining a collaborative tone. 
* **Above Key Threshold:** The offer stays above the $1 million psychological barrier, which may be influential in Bob's perception of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Movement:** Bob's offer only increased by $30,000, indicating a reluctance to move significantly towards your target price.
* **Time Constraint vs. Potential:**  While time is a factor with 4 rounds remaining, you're still substantially above Bob's perceived value and below your guaranteed alternative. There's a reasonable chance of a better offer if you remain firm.
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** Accepting a price below $1,000,000 could undervalue the product in the eyes of future potential buyers (even if you ultimately sell to John). 

You're willing to continue negotiating, but another small concession from Bob is unlikely to be enough to sway you."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but we need to find a price that reflects the true value of what's on the table.  I'm willing to consider $1,005,000.  This is a significant move on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1005000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer signals that you're reaching your bottom line while still leaving room for a final concession if Bob shows strong movement.
* **Small Concession:** The $15,000 decrease is a calculated risk, showing flexibility without dropping below the $1 million mark.
* **Shifting Tone:** The message highlights your concessions and emphasizes the need for Bob to reciprocate to finalize the deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  With three rounds left, the offer subtly increases time pressure on Bob, encouraging a decision.

This counteroffer aims to secure a price close to your target while acknowledging the negotiation process and respecting Bob's position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $980,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's offer only increased by $10,000, indicating extremely slow progress and a strong likelihood that he won't significantly increase his offer.
* **Below Acceptable Threshold:**  Even with two rounds remaining, $990,000 remains considerably below your minimum acceptable price and your guaranteed alternative.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of missing out on a sure $1,200,000 from John.  The potential gain from Bob's very unlikely movement is outweighed by this guaranteed profit. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. You've negotiated in good faith, but Bob's unwillingness to move substantially justifies accepting John's offer."
