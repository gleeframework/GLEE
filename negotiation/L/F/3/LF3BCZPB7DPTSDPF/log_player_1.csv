Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" aims to justify the high price and create a sense of desirability.
* **Confidence:** By stating your proposed price confidently and framing it as ""fair,"" you project a sense of the product's value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $800,000, he doesn't know your minimum price. He might be willing to pay more, hence the higher offer. 
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer is not the final price.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower your price slightly, but never go below $800,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer gives you a strong position. Bob needs to feel that if he doesn't make a reasonable offer, he might lose the opportunity."
