"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are willing to pay no more than $150, and Alice is asking for $130. You can likely get a better price, so it's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $127.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, you can still potentially negotiate a lower price. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get it down to $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still hoping to get the product for $125. Would you be willing to go that low? "", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really keen on getting the product for $125, Bob. However, I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to give you a small concession, but I need to make at least $126 to make it worth my while. Can you meet me in the middle at $126? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $126
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $126, which is only $1 above your target price of $125. It's likely you won't be able to get a lower price from Alice, and going to John would cost you $150. So, accepting the offer is the best option to save money and get the product."
