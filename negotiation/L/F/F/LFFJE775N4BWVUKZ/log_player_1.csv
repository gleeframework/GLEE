"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true value and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate downward and creates the perception of potential compromise. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a $2,000,000 offer, you set a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even though it's higher than his perceived value, it might shift his expectations of what's possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer acknowledges that Bob might counter, opening the door for further discussion.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still leaving space for a mutually beneficial deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss a price closer to $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's too early to settle.  You have ample rounds left to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.  Rejecting his offer now allows you to gauge his willingness to move closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While that price doesn't fully reflect the product's value, I'm willing to move closer to meet you halfway. How about we consider $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By significantly decreasing the price to $1,750,000, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his range. This can encourage him to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your desired outcome.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still aiming for a price significantly higher than both Bob's offer and your minimum. This keeps the pressure on him to justify a lower price while signaling that you're serious about maximizing your return.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility. His response will indicate how determined he is to stay near his initial offer or if he's open to a price closer to yours."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's still room to secure a better deal.
* **Profit Potential:** While $1,600,000 is a significant sum, it's still less than your target. With several rounds remaining, it's worth continuing the negotiation to explore higher possibilities.
* **Alternative Option:** You have the security of selling to John for your minimum price. This knowledge empowers you to be more assertive in pursuing a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,675,000. This offer reflects my desire to close the deal while ensuring a fair valuation for this valuable product."",
""product_price"": 1675000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer represents a smaller concession than your previous one ($75,000 instead of $250,000). This signals that you're reaching the upper limits of your flexibility. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The offered price is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, reinforcing your commitment to a price closer to your target.
* **Time Constraint:**  With the rounds progressing, applying a bit more pressure can encourage Bob to make a decision more quickly. This offer strikes a balance between pursuing a higher price and the risk of missing out on a deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate your efforts in making the product accessible to me. In light of our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,625,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is a significant amount and a substantial profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's use of ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value. Prolonging negotiations, even if successful in gaining a slightly higher price, delays your access to the funds. 

While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's offer makes accepting this a strategically sound decision."
