Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my current needs. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  It's a reasonable price for the product and still allows some room for profit for you. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1150000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
