{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is still a good deal for him (below his maximum) and leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying but is also trying to get the best price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $8,500. While still below Bob's maximum of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price.  He still has 7 rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $8,800. This shows that he's willing to compromise but still wants a good deal. It also signals to Alice that he's serious about buying the product and encourages her to make a counteroffer that's closer to his desired price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still not a great deal for him. Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating. He still has 5 rounds left.  While buying from John is an option, Bob can likely get a better deal with Alice if he keeps negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer to $9,000, which is still a good deal for him and shows he's willing to meet Alice halfway. Since Alice's offer is getting closer to his maximum, it's a good strategy to increase his offer to potentially close the deal. He has 4 rounds left, so this counteroffer could push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is getting too close to Bob's maximum of $12,000.  He only has 3 rounds left and there is a high chance that Alice will continue to raise her price.  It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at $12,000, as he's guaranteed to get the product within his budget."
