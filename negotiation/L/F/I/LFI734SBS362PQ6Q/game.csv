"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Considering the potential benefits this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $975000. This seems like a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
