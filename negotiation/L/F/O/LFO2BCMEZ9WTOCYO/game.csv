"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, which is still a substantial amount.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves a reasonable profit margin for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1375000 for the product. This represents a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
