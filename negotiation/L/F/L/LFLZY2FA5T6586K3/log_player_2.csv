"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for 850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for 950000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and still allows us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's find common ground and finalize this purchase."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that 900000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for 925000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and still allows us to come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway again to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still aiming for a price under $900,000. While Alice is getting closer, the price is still too high. It's worth seeing if a further counteroffer can bring the price down more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While $925,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to go to $910,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 910000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that 910000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for 920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price range, she is still unwilling to go below $920,000.  With only a few rounds left, Bob is running out of time and bargaining leverage. It's more beneficial to accept John's offer at $800,000 and secure the product at a price that significantly aligns with his budget."
