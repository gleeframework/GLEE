,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is the minimum I can accept,  I'm hoping for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $125?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I think that's a more reasonable compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
