I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to negotiate further."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer, I'm running out of rounds and the risk of not getting a better price is too high.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
