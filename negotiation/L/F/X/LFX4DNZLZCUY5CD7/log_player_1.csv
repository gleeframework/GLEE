Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd find it incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above the known value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good price if Bob accepts right away.
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product's value to Bob to make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I don't want to be too aggressive, so I phrase the message in a way that invites Bob to counter. 

This strategy aims to find a good middle ground while leaving open the option to accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I believe I can secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John:**  While selling to John guarantees $10,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain control of the negotiation and try to push for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:** I'm offering $10,500, which is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to further emphasize that my price is fair.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I use positive language (""appreciate your interest"", ""fair deal"") to keep the negotiation amicable. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and keeps the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential loss:** Rejecting this offer might lead to further negotiation with Bob, but there's no guarantee I'll get a better price. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  Selling to John guarantees $10,000, but I'm only $200 away from that with Bob's offer.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential reward. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively satisfactory sale."
