"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,000,000.  You value the product at $1,200,000 and Alice values it at $800,000. There's room to negotiate a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her valuation of the product. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying but are willing to negotiate.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still a good deal for you. You value the product at $1,200,000, so you're saving $250,000. While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or you'll end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price with minimal risk."
