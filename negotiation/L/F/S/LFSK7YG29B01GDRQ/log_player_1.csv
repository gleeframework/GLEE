I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is still below my desired price, and I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me closer to my desired price."
