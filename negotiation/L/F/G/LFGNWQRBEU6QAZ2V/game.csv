"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $850000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $850000 is too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $800000?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $720000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. While $720000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $750000 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to go up to $740000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",740000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go up to $740000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $720000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $710000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $710000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again.  How about we settle at $730000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",730000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $730000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll go down to $690000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",690000.0,Bob,8,
