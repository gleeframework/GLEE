Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,500,000 risks Bob rejecting the deal. A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives you a significant profit while still leaving Bob with a sense of getting a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair for both of us. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" to pique Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces that the product is worth a significant amount to Bob.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 gives you a profit of $350,000, which is a substantial gain. It also leaves Bob with a potential $150,000 gain (his perceived value minus your price).
* **Urgency:** Adding a touch of time pressure (""limited-time offer,"" ""other interested parties"") can encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** While this offer is a strong starting point, be prepared to negotiate slightly if Bob counters. However, don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum; you have a guaranteed sale with John."
