"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $175?  That would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good value.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $150? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",150.0,Bob,4,
