"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating I'm open to negotiation, I show flexibility and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Positive Language:**  I use positive language to create a good impression and highlight the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and either accept it or make a new counteroffer.  If negotiations stall, I'll have the option to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would be a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he's expressed interest in the product and acknowledges a potential for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my desired price but still reflects the possibility of a deal. My goal is to find a price that is fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $175?  That would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good value."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial $200 price.
* **Maintain Profitability:**  $175 is still above my minimum price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, appealing to Bob's desire for value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, I've secured a sale. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.  If the negotiation stalls, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $150? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:**  Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer ensures I don't lose money on the sale. 
* **Successful Negotiation:** We have successfully negotiated a price that works for both of us.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting the offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations or potentially having to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the purchase details with Bob and complete the transaction."
