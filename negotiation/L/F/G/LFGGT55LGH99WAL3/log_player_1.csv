"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $150. I'm curious to see what Bob's initial reaction will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to sell for the minimum just yet.  I'll see if I can get him to move closer to my initial price with a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for him to consider.  If he rejects, I'll have to reassess my strategy and potentially move closer to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $155 is a small improvement over his previous offer and is a decent amount above my minimum of $150.  Since I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, I'll accept Bob's offer."
