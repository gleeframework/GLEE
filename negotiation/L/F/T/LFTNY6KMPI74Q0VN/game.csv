"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $8,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure I get a fair return. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Alice,5,
