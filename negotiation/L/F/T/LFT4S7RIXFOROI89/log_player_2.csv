"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer represents a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than the price from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $12,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I could be persuaded to go down to $13,000. This offer still reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is still a bit higher than his ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's offer of $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
