"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise at $110, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $90. Let's make a deal!",90.0,Bob,6,
