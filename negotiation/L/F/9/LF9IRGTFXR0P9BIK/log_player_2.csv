Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $130 is a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot!

Alice is trying to push back up to a higher price. I'll counter again, but this time I'll be closer to her offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $142 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $135.  That's a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $139, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not making a profit at $135, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle again! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $139. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $139
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, and it's getting late in the negotiation.  It's worth accepting her offer and saving myself some time and potential frustration."
