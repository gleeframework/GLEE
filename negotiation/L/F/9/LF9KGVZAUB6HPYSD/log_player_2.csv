{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still too high, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation. It's unlikely that she'll come down to his desired price, and it's better to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with rather than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the opportunity to buy from John."
