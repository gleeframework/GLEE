Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, attempting to sell to Bob first allows us to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
    * Lower than John's guaranteed purchase price, ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates down.
* **Exclusivity:** Emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" might make the offer more enticing and encourage Bob to consider it seriously."
