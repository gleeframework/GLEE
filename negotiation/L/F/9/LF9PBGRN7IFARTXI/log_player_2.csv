"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's asking for $12,000. That's a big markup, and I'm not willing to pay that much.  I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$11,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll counter with a lower offer, but I'm getting closer to the point where I might just buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential profit you'll make. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm very close to accepting John's offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to accepting John's offer, Bob, but I'd like to give you one more chance to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. This is a compromise that should be fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is now offering $10,500, which is just a little over my limit.  It's tempting to try and negotiate further, but I'm worried that I'll end up paying more than I want.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John and save some money."
