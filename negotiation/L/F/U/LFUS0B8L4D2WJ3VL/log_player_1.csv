Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this item, $850000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is the highest I'm willing to go at this point, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?
