"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this item, $850000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $775000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional item. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $775000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to offer $750000. This is the highest I'm willing to go at this point, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you at $810000, which is closer to my initial price, but still a bit of a concession. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and is a fair deal for both of us.
