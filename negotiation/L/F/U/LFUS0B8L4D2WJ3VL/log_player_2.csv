"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. I believe this price reflects its exceptional quality and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, but you can likely get it lower.  It's worth trying to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $775000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

While $775,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You have room to go lower, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you at $810000, which is closer to my initial price, but still a bit of a concession. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $810,000 is still a good deal for you.  It's closer to your target price than John's offer, and you've already had several rounds of negotiation. It's likely that further negotiation will be harder and time-consuming.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point."
