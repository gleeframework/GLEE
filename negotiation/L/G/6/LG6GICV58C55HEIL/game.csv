"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm offering it to you at a price that allows for both of us to benefit.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value to your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
