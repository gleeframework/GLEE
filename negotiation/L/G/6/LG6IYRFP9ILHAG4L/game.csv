"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product goes far beyond standard metrics.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000.  This reflects its unique capabilities and potential for return on your investment.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000? This recognizes the inherent value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. To help you see the value, I'm willing to sweeten the deal. If you agree to $1,300,000, I'll include [add a valuable bonus related to the product or a service you can provide].  This significantly enhances the product's overall worth and addresses some of the concerns you've raised.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm still not convinced it's enough to justify the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
