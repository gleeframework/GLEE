Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

We're still far from a desirable outcome.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob seems to be stuck at $1,200,000. It's time to apply a different tactic to see if we can push past this roadblock."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. To help you see the value, I'm willing to sweeten the deal.

This significantly enhances the product's overall worth and addresses some of the concerns you've raised."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm still not convinced it's enough to justify the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge past $1,200,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 is the safest option to secure a guaranteed return at this point, even if it means leaving some potential profit on the table."
