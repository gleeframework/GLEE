"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value for Bob:** $15,000
* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000
* **Value for Alice:** $8,000

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $12,000. There's still a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum value.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value for Bob:** $15,000
* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000
* **Value for Alice:** $8,000

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's price, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for negotiation. It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value for Bob:** $15,000
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,500
* **Value for Alice:** $8,000

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, accepting this offer gives him a good deal ($3,500 below his maximum value) and avoids the risk of Alice becoming less flexible or Bob running out of rounds."
