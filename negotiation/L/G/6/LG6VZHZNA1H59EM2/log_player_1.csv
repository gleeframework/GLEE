"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price of $14,000 by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a fair price."
