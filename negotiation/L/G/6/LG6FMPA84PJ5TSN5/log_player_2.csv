"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is my maximum budget, there's no reason to assume that's the absolute lowest Alice is willing to go. I can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it shows I'm serious about negotiating.  I'm hoping Alice will counter with something closer to my offer, giving us room to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's further room for negotiation, especially with 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This should keep the negotiation moving and potentially lead to a more favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I'd love to get it even lower, I've only got 5 rounds left. There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could result in a stalemate or Alice simply becoming unwilling to sell.  At this point, accepting the offer is a safe bet to get the product within my budget."
