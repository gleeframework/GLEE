"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product but would be more comfortable at $8000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000. I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. Would you be willing to come down a little closer to my initial offer of $8000? Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
