"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I can offer it for $17,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",17000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  How about $16,000? This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",14000.0,Bob,6,
