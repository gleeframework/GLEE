"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  $90 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** Bob is aiming to get a price close to Alice's minimum value. 
* **Be polite:** A friendly message keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Leave room for compromise:** $85 is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is now close to Bob's maximum value.**  $87.5 is only slightly more than Bob's ideal price of $85.
* **Accepting saves time and effort.** Further negotiation could be lengthy, and there's no guarantee Bob could get a better price.
* **John is a backup.** Even though accepting this offer means a slightly higher price, Bob still has the option of buying from John as a backup if he changes his mind later."
