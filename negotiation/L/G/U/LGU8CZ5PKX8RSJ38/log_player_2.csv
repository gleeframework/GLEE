It's always worth trying to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less.  Let's see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a significant counteroffer. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate and meet us somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice has come down a bit, and $850,000 is a good price, especially considering John is asking for $1,500,000. It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product."
