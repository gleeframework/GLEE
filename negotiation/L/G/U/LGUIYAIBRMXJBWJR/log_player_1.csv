"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting high, aiming for my ideal price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm not afraid to push for a strong price.  If Bob rejects this, we can negotiate further."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round.  We're still early in the negotiation and I have plenty of room to maneuver."

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to me.  I'm confident that Bob will find this offer more appealing than his last one, but I'm also leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm confident we can find a middle ground in the next round.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm still holding out for a higher price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to squeeze a little more out of the deal.  With John as a backup, I'm not feeling pressured to accept a price that is too low.  I'll counter again in the next round and see if we can find a common ground."

I'm making one final concession. With just a few rounds left, I want to see if we can close the deal. $11,000 is a fair price, considering both our desired prices. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is the last round where I can get a better price from John.  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum but not quite there.  I'm happy to close the deal with John and secure a price that I'm comfortable with."
