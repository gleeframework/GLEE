"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm thinking of a price of $12000 for this exceptional item. Would you like to make an offer or accept my price?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However,  $12000 is my upper limit for this product. To start negotiations, I'd like to offer you $9000. This reflects my understanding of the market value for similar products.  I'm open to discussing a price closer to your asking price if you're willing to compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $9000. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11000. This is a compromise that still allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While I understand your perspective, $11000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $10000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident this is a price that would work for both of us. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'd like to propose a compromise of $11500. This is a fair price that reflects the value I've placed on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable ask considering the product's unique features.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $11500 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale at this price.  ",10500.0,Bob,6,
