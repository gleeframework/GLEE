,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit higher than its worth, considering my budget and research on similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. I believe that's a fair price, considering my research and budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
