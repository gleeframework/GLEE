"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $108. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $108 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to go up to $107. If that works for you, we have a deal!",107.0,Bob,4,
