Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This gives you a significant discount while allowing me to still get a decent return on my investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.
