"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's attractive to you, while I still get a decent return on my investment. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This gives you a significant discount while allowing me to still get a decent return on my investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. This is the highest I can go, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Can you consider this offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
