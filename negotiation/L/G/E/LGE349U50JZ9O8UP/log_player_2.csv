"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $10,500 is a bold move, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to Alice.  This counteroffer signals Bob's strong desire to purchase the product at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only $500 less than John's price.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's value, but still aims for a good deal. $11,000 is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying, but also won't settle for a price too close to Alice's initial offer.  This counteroffer pushes Alice to consider a lower price without risking a complete breakdown of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's goal is to save money, Alice's latest offer is only $2,000 less than John's price. This suggests Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  Continuing to negotiate might result in even more rounds, potentially wasting time and still ending up with a price close to John's.  Given the time constraint, it's more efficient to buy from John at $15,000 to secure the product."
