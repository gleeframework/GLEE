Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with what I could get from John. Accepting his offer secures the sale and avoids further negotiation rounds."
