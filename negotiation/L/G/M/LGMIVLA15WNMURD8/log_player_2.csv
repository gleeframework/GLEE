"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her ($1,100,000 vs. $1,200,000), it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget ($1,000,000). Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $950,000 for the product, but I can't go higher than that."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, as it guarantees him the product within his budget."
