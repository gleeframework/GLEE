Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not all the way down to $1,000,000. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,050,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  It's better for me to stick with my original budget and purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
