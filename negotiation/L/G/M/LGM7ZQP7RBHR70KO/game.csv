"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not all the way down to $1,000,000. Let's try to find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
