"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price considering we're both close to our target. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
