"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still above your desired maximum price.
* It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if you can get a better price from Alice. 
* Buying from John is always an option, but it's the most expensive choice, and you want to exhaust other possibilities first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Starting with a lower counteroffer shows your commitment to saving money and encourages Alice to be more flexible. 
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason for your offer (budget) makes it seem less arbitrary and more likely to be taken seriously.
* **Target price:**  $750,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  $850,000 is still higher than your target price. 
* **Negotiation room:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and you can likely squeeze a better deal.
* **Potential for a better price:** With more rounds, you can continue to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price considering we're both close to our target. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:**  Instead of making a huge jump, you're gradually increasing your offer to show a willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget.
* **Emphasize fairness:** Highlighting that your offer is close to both your targets suggests a win-win scenario.
* **Urgency:**  Subtly mentioning closing the deal creates a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to be more flexible."
