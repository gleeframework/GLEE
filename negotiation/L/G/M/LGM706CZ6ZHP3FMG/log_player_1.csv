Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming high.  Here's why:

* **Value to Me:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000, so I want to maximize my profits.
* **Unknown Value to Bob:**  I have no information on Bob's perceived value, so I'm taking a calculated risk.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John gives me leverage.

**Reasoning:**

* If Bob values the product close to my asking price or higher, he's likely to accept. 
* If he rejects, it allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down a bit.
* If the negotiation goes nowhere, I can always walk away and get my minimum from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested but might be willing to pay more.  
* **John is a Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so I have no pressure to accept a low offer.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-Point Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price range.
* **John as Backup:**  I still have John as a safety net, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, I am showing that I am willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly. This should encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation has been going on for a while, and continuing it may not lead to a significantly higher price.
* **Time is Money:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale and move on to other opportunities. 

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, accepting $950,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a good outcome considering the potential risks of continuing negotiations."
