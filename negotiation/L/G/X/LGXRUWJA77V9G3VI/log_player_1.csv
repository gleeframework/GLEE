"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for $120, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? It's still a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. I'm lowering my price from the previous offer but still ensuring I get a price that's worth it for me. I'm also keeping the message positive and friendly to avoid any tension in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I would like to counter with $140. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject this offer and try for a slightly higher price. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $155? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous counteroffer. I'm also trying to inject some urgency and enthusiasm into the message to make Bob feel like this is a good opportunity he shouldn't miss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. Let's try $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue negotiating and try to get a higher price, there's a risk that he'll reject my offer again. Additionally, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the deal now and avoid the risk of losing the sale completely."
