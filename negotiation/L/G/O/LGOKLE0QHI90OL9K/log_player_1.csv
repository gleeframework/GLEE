Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you, and this offer reflects a fair price given its potential value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing you a significant profit.
* **Backup Plan:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more ambitious initial offer to Bob."
