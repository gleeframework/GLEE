"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I expect to get from the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this price is more reasonable. What do you think?",12800.0,Bob,4,
