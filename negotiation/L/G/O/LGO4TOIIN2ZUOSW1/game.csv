"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident it would benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $15,000. I'd like to make a serious offer at this price.",15000.0,Bob,4,
