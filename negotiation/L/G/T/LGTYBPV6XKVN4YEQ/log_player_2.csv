```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $14,000 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a lower price, especially since you have multiple rounds left."

Round 4

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I can do $13,500, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. This is my final offer in this range.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,500, which is $13,000. This is my final offer in this range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above your budget, and you only have three rounds left.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000, as it's the best deal available and ensures you get the product within your budget."
