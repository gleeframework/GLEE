"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $5,000 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in seeing if she'll budge.  There are also 9 more rounds to negotiate, so I have time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see how far she's willing to go.  I'm aiming for a significant discount, but I'm still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. Since I'm still within the early rounds and have time to negotiate, it's worth trying to get a lower price. I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $3,500 to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from $3,000 to $3,500. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Alice than my previous one and we can start closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,200 is getting closer to my desired price range, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. We've only had five rounds, and I'm confident we can reach a better deal.  I will try to make a counteroffer that's a little more aggressive, but still within a reasonable range.  I need to find a balance between being firm and being willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has moved down slightly, so I'm adjusting my counteroffer up to $3,800. This signals a willingness to compromise while still keeping the pressure on Alice to lower her price.  With only four rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to get closer to a deal.  I'm hoping this offer will be tempting enough for Alice to accept, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is inching closer to my desired price range, but it's still not where I want it to be.  We have only three rounds left, so the pressure is mounting, but I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap.  If it's rejected, I'll have to weigh the possibility of buying from John or accepting Alice's final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, I'm making a more significant increase in my counteroffer.  I'm hoping to get closer to Alice's price point and find a compromise.  $4,000 is a reasonable middle ground considering our previous negotiations.  If Alice rejects this offer, I will seriously consider buying from John, as the potential savings are diminishing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price point.  While I could counteroffer again, the risk of getting stuck with a price that's too high for me is significant.  Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees me the product while staying within my budget.  While it's not the ideal price, it's a safer option considering the limited negotiation rounds remaining."
