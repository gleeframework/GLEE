"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $950,000.  While this is a better price than John's, Bob should try to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850000 doesn't quite cover the value this product offers you. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still leaves room for you to profit.  This is my final offer, let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $900,000. This means Bob can still make a profit of $100,000.
* **Risk:**  Rejecting the offer risks going back and forth with Alice, potentially ending up with a higher price or losing the deal altogether.  Buying from John would result in a lower profit. 
* **Finality:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, suggesting further negotiation may be futile.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to secure the product while maximizing profit."
