Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you're making a decent profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still room to come down if Bob counters, allowing for potential for a mutually agreeable price.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By starting high, you demonstrate the value of the product and signal your intent to negotiate seriously. 

Remember,  the goal is to maximize your profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a higher price. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob recognizes the product's value and is willing to pay more than John. There's a good chance you can get closer to your initial asking price with some negotiation.
* **Strategic leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that you're not desperate for a sale and are willing to walk away if necessary. This can strengthen your position in the negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that might lead to a more favorable outcome than selling to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value this product offers you. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for you to profit.  This is my final offer, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** You're acknowledging Bob's budget limitations while still pushing for a higher price than his initial offer.
* **Finality:**  Stating this is your ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to seriously consider accepting.
* **Benefit Highlight:** Emphasize the profit Bob can still make,  further motivating him to accept.

This counteroffer offers a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful sale while still securing a higher price than selling to John."
