Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay  $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Would you consider $1,550,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**  Alice is very slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's unlikely she'll go below $1,500,000 which is John's offer. It's better to secure the product at a known price than risk further negotiation."
