"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to its true value. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This gives you a good price and me a fair return. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a reasonable compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $12,500 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this. How about $13,000? That's a strong offer, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
