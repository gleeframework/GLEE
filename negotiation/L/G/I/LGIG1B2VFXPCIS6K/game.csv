"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're bringing to the table, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
