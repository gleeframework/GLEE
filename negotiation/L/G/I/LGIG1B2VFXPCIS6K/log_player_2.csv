"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're bringing to the table, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's price of $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject further offers, leaving Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a purchase at a price that is both reasonable and less than John's."
