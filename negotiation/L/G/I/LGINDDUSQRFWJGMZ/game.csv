"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $15000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's my final offer. Can you do any better than that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. How about we meet in the middle again at $13250? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $13250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $13000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000",13000.0,Bob,6,
