Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point.** It's a significant profit for me and still leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** I want to establish a positive rapport with Bob and motivate him to accept the offer. 
* **I highlight the value of the product to Bob.** This is a subtle reminder of what he stands to gain by purchasing it.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and my desired profit margin.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but the product truly is worth more than that.  To make things work, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I acknowledge Bob's offer:** This shows respect and keeps the negotiation positive.
* **I emphasize the value of the product:** This reminds Bob of the benefits he'll receive.
* **I propose a compromise:** $12,500 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. 
* **I remain open to negotiation:** The message concludes with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation alive, while still showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,750 is less than my desired price, it's still significantly higher than selling to John.  At this point, it's likely that we've reached a point where further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the potential for a breakdown in negotiations."
