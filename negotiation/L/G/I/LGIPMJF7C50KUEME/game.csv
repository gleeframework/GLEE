"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its worth and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but the product truly is worth more than that.  To make things work, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
