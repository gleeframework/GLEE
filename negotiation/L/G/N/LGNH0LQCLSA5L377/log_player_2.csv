"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,350,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's new offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to risk another counteroffer to try and squeeze a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget limit. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one last concession. I can meet you at $1,300,000. That's the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's final offer is still $100,000 above my maximum budget.  At this point, it's more financially beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, even though it's my maximum. I've already tried to negotiate with Alice and reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price."
