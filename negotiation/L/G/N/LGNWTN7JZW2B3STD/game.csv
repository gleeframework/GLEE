"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. However, to be transparent, your current offer is simply too far below what I can accept.  Let's try this â€“ I'm willing to consider a price of $1,800,000.  This is a significant move on my part, reflecting my willingness to make a deal. What do you say?",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I think I can do even better than that. I'm offering $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
