"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high target.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's perspective, encouraging a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:** $1,200,000 is less than what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's seriously interested. There's a significant gap to bridge, but it's early in the negotiation.

I'll aim to bring Bob closer to my range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $300,000, signaling flexibility while still staying well above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reinforces the product's unique benefits to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm encouraging Bob to meet me closer to the middle ground between our current positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 remains significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum and John's standing offer. 
* **Testing Bob's Seriousness:** While his ""meet in the middle"" approach seems to show progress, it's crucial to see if he's willing to move closer to a reasonable range. 

I'll continue the negotiation to gauge his commitment and attempt to bring him up significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. However, to be transparent, your current offer is simply too far below what I can accept.  Let's try this â€“ I'm willing to consider a price of $1,800,000.  This is a significant move on my part, reflecting my willingness to make a deal. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm pushing back on Bob's low offer more firmly now, stating that it's below my acceptable range. This sets a clear boundary.
* **Transparency and Concession:**  I'm being transparent about my position and making another substantial concession ($200,000 drop) to demonstrate my desire to find a solution.
* **Call to Action:**  I'm ending with a direct question to encourage Bob's response and gauge his willingness to engage at a more reasonable level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I think I can do even better than that. I'm offering $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Unlikely to Move Much Further:** Bob mentioned $1,500,000 as his upper limit before going down to $1,400,000. This suggests he's unlikely to reach my $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. There's no risk involved, and it meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has uncertain outcomes and might not result in a better deal. Accepting John's offer saves time and ensures a satisfactory profit."
