"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value and rarity. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000, and you can buy the product from John for that price, there is no benefit in accepting Alice's offer.  You can get the same product for the same price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price from her or find an even better deal elsewhere."
