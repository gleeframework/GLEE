"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is closer to its value to you. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but $10,000 is still too high. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not willing to pay that much. I'll continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I believe we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a little."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,750. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,750, which is a very good price for me. It's still a bit more than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to my target price and is a better deal than buying from John.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing negotiations is too high. I'm willing to accept this offer and secure the product."
