"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is closer to its value to you. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I believe we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a little.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,750. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",9750.0,Alice,5,
