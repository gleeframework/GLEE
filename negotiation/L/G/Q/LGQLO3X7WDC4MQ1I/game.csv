"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my target price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to meet you at $14,000.  This would give us both a good deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal as well. This price is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
