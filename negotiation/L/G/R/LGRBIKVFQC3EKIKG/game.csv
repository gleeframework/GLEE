"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $10,750 is a good deal for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $11,250? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
