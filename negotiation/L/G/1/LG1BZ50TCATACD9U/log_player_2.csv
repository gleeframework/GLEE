"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth exploring negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $850000 is a good starting point, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. There are still rounds available, so I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. I believe this represents a fair compromise, allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to go down to $1000000, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached her ""absolute minimum"" of $1,000,000, which is still higher than my budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up.  

It's more beneficial to lock in the guaranteed price from John at $800,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget without further negotiation."
