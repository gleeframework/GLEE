Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another buyer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows for potential profit maximization.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation while still netting you a substantial profit.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision."
