{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to go down a little. How about $110? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

I've decided to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it seems we can't reach a price that works for both of us.  John's offer is my minimum and it's time to move on."
