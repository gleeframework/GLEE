Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:**  $19,000 gives you room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interest and a limited-time offer might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Justification:** While you don't want to reveal John's offer, implying the product's high demand and value might make Bob more receptive to the price. 

**Important:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always adjust your price downwards, but never go below your $15,000 safety net."
