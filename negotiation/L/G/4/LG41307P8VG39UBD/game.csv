,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer represents a substantial compromise on my end, while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $1,250,000 for this product. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the value I place on it. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your desire to close this deal, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'm prepared to move on to another vendor.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
