"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $120, and Alice's offer is $90, you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you consider $75?  "", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, you still have some room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a price closer to your desired $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $82.  Would you be willing to come down to $78? This is really my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 78}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $78 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $81. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $81, which is very close to your desired price of $78 and significantly lower than John's price of $120. It's likely that continued negotiation won't get you much lower, and you risk running out of rounds. Accepting the offer is the best option to secure a good deal."
