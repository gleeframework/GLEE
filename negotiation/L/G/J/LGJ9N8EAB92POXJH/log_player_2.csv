"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $9,500. I believe it offers exceptional value, especially considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  He has room to negotiate since he's willing to pay up to $10,000.  By rejecting, Bob signals he's serious about getting a better price and opens the door to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $9,250 is a good compromise. Bob can save $750 compared to buying from John, and it's only $250 more than his own counter-offer.  It's a fair deal that allows both parties to benefit."
