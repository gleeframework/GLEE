Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it might be worth more than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob. It weakens your negotiating position.  

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob."
