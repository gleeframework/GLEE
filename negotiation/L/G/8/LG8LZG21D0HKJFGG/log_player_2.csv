"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $125. This price reflects the product's worth and my desire to ensure you receive a fair deal. I trust you'll find it to be a valuable investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $125 is lower than John's price of $150, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal.  She might be willing to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale."
