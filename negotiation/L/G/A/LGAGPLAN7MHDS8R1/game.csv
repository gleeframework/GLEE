"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go down to $1,050,000. How about we split the difference and settle for $1,100,000? It's still a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,075,000? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to move forward with the deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from $1,087,500. I'd be willing to go up to $1,075,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
