"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussions.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer reflects the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my best offer and represents a significant discount from my initial asking price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your price, but $1,800,000 is still far beyond what I'm able to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I need to see some real movement on price for this to work for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I also have other interested buyers.  To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,500,000. I'm willing to honor our negotiations and drop my price to $1,600,000, but this is my absolute floor. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about other buyers, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  To be completely upfront, my absolute maximum is $800,000. If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, but I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
