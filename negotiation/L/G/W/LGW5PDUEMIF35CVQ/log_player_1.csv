Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty about other buyers, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  To be completely upfront, my absolute maximum is $800,000. If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, but I'll have to explore other options.

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his absolute maximum price ($800,000), and it's significantly lower than what John is offering.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll move much higher, and we risk losing John's offer. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome for you."
