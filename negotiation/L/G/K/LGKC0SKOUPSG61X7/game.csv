"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $875,000?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.",875000.0,Bob,4,
