"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $120 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. This would allow me to purchase it while still staying within my spending limit.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider a price of $105 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If this works for you, we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
