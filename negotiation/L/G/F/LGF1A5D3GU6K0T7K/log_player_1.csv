**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a consistent unwillingness to meet Alice's price expectations. While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's clear from the negotiation pattern that Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  

Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is her minimum acceptable price. It makes more financial sense for Alice to take the guaranteed deal rather than risking further negotiation with Bob, which may not result in a significantly better outcome."
