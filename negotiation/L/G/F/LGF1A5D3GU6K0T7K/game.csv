"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what this product can offer you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. I'm still working within my budget constraints. Could we meet somewhere closer to $900,000? This would allow me to consider your offer more seriously.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While I'm motivated to find a solution, $900,000 doesn't reflect the market value or the potential return on investment this product offers. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
