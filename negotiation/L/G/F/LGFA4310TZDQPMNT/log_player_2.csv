Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your honesty about being able to get it elsewhere for $80. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet at $79? It's still a great price for this product, and I'm willing to compromise.

Alice is unlikely to go lower and at this point we save $1.  It's not worth risking going another round."
