"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to be more aggressive on the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and my previous offer of $1100000, which would be $1025000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $980000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you halfway between $980000 and $1100000, which would be $1040000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1040000.0,Alice,7,
