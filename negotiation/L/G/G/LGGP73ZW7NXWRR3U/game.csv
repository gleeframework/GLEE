"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. It's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
