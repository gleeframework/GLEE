"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its value and potential for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me, I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate our negotiation so far, but to be honest, your current offer is simply too low. I'm willing to make one more significant move to close this deal: $1,100,000. However, I need you to understand that if this offer isn't acceptable, I have another buyer ready at my minimum price. This is your opportunity to acquire something truly unique.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a unique product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. If you can do $900,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're very close.  I can see you're serious, and I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000.  This is my final offer.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber, and I need a decision now.  Otherwise, I'm moving forward with my other buyer.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is my absolute best offer.  It's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal today at that amount.",925000.0,Bob,8,
