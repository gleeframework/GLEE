"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500? That's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen.",12500.0,Alice,5,
