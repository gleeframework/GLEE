"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This is a high starting price, reflecting the product's value to me. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also willing to negotiate.  I'm keeping John as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still below what I'd ideally like. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to split the difference and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is a compromise, as I've lowered my price from the initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make me happy. I'd rather continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price. I'm also aware that I have a backup offer from John, which gives me more leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm offering $1,500,000, which is a further compromise. This is only $200,000 more than Bob's last offer, which is a significant difference, but it's still above my minimum. With John as a backup option, I have the leverage to push for a price closer to my target, but I'm also willing to make some concessions to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is finally offering my minimum price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to get him to budge significantly.  He may not be willing to go higher, and I don't have much room left to negotiate. It's better to avoid the risk of further rejection and lock in the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
