Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still provides substantial value to Bob (saving him $50,000 compared to its worth to him).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product. 
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message avoids appearing desperate or overly aggressive, which could make Bob wary."
