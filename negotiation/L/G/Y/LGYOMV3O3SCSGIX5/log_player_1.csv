"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential for your specific needs are significantly higher.  I could consider coming down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, the gap is closing slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach my $1,000,000 minimum without significant further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk of Bob stalling or ultimately not meeting my valuation."
