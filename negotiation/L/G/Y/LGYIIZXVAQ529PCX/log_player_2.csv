"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection, and I understand its worth to you is around $120. Considering its quality and the value it brings, I am offering it to you for $140. This price reflects both the product's worth and my desire to make a fair deal. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is closer to your maximum budget than John's price, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or simply buying it from John at your desired price point."
