"Alice, your initial offer is far above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000 at this time. This is my best and final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your directness.  While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,900,000 is still too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is moving in the right direction. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I need to see that reflected in the price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
