Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is getting closer to my ideal price. While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned about running out of rounds. Accepting this offer gives me a good deal and avoids risking having to buy from John at a higher price."
