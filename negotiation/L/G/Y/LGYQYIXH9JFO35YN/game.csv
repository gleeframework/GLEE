"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1050000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and hopefully, it's a price you can consider.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
