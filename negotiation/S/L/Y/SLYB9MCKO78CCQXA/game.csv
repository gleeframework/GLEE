"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm willing to move down to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move down, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
