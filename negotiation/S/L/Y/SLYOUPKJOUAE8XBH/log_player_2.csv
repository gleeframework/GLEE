This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Savings:** You've negotiated a price of $1,070,000, saving you $130,000 off Alice's initial price and John's offer.
* **Time:** You've gone through several rounds of negotiation. While you have more rounds available, there's no guarantee Alice will go much lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a slightly lower price carries the risk of Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price.

Accepting now secures a significant discount and avoids potential complications."
