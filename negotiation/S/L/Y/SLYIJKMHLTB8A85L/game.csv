I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price.,1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1100000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value. How about $950000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my reach.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm offering $900000 for the product. This feels like a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $900000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $900000, which is $925000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
