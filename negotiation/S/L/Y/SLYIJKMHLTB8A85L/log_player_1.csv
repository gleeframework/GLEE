Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1100000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
