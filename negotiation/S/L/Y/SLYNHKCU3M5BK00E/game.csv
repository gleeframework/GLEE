"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $9,500? That would work much better for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $10,200, which is still a good compromise. It's a small step back from my original offer, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the product's value.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,200 is getting close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $9,750? I think that's a fair offer.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $10,150, which is a small step back from my previous offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",10150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. This is a fair price considering your previous concessions and my budget.  If you don't accept, I'll have to go with another seller.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, I'm willing to accept your offer. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,9,
