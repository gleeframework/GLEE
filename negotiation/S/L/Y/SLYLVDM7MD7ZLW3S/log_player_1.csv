{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that you're willing to work with Bob to find a price that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand that you're open to negotiation, and I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is above your minimum price of $100, and it shows he's interested in the product. Accepting his offer is the most financially beneficial option in this scenario."
