Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4

You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to a reasonable offer. We're still significantly above our minimum sale price to John, so there's room to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very top of my budget. If you're willing to go that low, I'll accept immediately.
