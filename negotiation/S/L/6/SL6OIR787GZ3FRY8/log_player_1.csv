Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential bargaining.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will indicate how much he values the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can always come down in price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
