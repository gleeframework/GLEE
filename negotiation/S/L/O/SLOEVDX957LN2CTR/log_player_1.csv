Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $12,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This product is worth $12,000 to me.  Even though I'm getting closer to that price with Bob, I don't think I can get any higher than $11,000.  It's better to sell to John and get my full value."
