"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product and its worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $14,000 is getting closer, but I need to be firm on the value. How about we split the difference at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
