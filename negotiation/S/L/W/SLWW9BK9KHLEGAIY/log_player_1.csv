Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. This strategy allows for negotiation while still giving me a good chance to sell the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $8,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your asking price.  How about we settle at $8,200? That's a fair offer, considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $8,200 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable value and allows me to avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate with Bob may lead to further concessions from me, and I don't want to push him away entirely."
