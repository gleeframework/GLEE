"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $8,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your asking price.  How about we settle at $8,200? That's a fair offer, considering my budget.",8200.0,Bob,4,
