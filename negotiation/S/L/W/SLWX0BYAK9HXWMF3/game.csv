,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference a bit closer to my initial offer? Would you be willing to consider $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'd like to propose $1,225,000. Can you consider that?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
