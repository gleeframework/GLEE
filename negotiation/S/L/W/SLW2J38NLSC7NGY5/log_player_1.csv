Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as I believe you'll find great value in it. I'm asking for $20,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more than selling to John.
* **Justification:** By mentioning Bob will ""find great value"" it suggests the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Open Communication:** The tone is friendly and encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

**Important:**  This is just one possible offer.  There's always a risk Bob will reject a higher price. A different strategy could involve a smaller markup to increase the chance of a quick sale."
