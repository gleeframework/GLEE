Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential counter-offers while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Alice can afford to be a bit bolder in her initial offer to Bob."
