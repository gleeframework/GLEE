"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its potential value. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is simply too low for me. Given the unique qualities of this product and its potential for you, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still out of my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential value and the fact that I have another seller willing to provide the product for that amount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
