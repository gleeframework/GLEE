"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Could you consider a price closer to that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living. I can do $100, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a high-quality product like this.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100. How about $97.50?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92.50?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really trying to get the best deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $95, but I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $10. That way, you'll be getting an even better value for your money.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer of the free accessory, but I'm still not sure if I can stretch my budget to $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've already given you a great deal with the accessory, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm going to have to draw the line at $95. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",95.0,Alice,9,
