"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
