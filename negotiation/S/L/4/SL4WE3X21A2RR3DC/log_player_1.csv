Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price increases the chance of a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is still significantly more than Bob values the product for ($120), but it's a tempting offer that might sway him, especially if he perceives the product as having some extra value.
* **Time Value of Money:** A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.  Even though I make slightly less profit, selling to Bob quicker means I get the money sooner and can use it for other things. 

This approach aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
