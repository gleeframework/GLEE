Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price that's still lower than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I mention the value the product offers, reminding Bob of its potential worth.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll also be prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired value.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us. I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations become too difficult or if I feel like I'm being undervalued."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price but still above Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Value Focus:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll receive.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I use language like ""let's find a solution"" to emphasize that I'm open to reaching an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll weigh his next offer against selling to John.  I'm confident that with continued negotiation, we can arrive at a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for your product. I believe this brings us closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting this offer keeps the door open for potential future negotiations with Bob if other opportunities arise.
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation might take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal, while keeping John in mind for future opportunities. I'm satisfied with this outcome, as it allows me to secure a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
