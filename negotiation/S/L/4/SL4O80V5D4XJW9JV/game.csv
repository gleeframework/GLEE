"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm looking to make a more significant saving. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects its value to me, but it's a more reasonable one for me to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a good price. While your offer is tempting, $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product brings. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that considers your savings while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
