"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is still a good profit for you, and it's the highest I can go at this time.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
