"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,100,000. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, you have room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and closer to Bob's target price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge again. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures a good deal."
