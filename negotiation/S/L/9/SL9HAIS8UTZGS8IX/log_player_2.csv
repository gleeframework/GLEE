"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a good price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a significant profit while staying within my spending limit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get her down to my target price, and I risk wasting more time. It's more efficient to buy from John at the fixed price of $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
