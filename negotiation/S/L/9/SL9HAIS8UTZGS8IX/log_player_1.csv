Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a good price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about selling.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal to make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Keeping John in mind:** This offer gives me some leverage as I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a significant profit while staying within my spending limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is a significant profit for him, it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Since Bob is willing to negotiate, rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John is a backup:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect again, hoping to convince Bob that this is a good deal for him too.
* **Building pressure:** This counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm serious about negotiating and not willing to settle for his initial offer."
