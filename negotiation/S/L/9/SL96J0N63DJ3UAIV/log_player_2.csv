"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is slightly better than her first offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price and there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject and try to get a lower price again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,500?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $13,000 is a fair price for both of us. It's a compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product, and it's still a good deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get close to your minimum price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,500, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get to at least $14,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm thinking $13,750 is a fair price for both of us. It's a compromise that acknowledges the value you place on the product, and it's a good deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get a better deal.  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's ideal price, $13,750 is still more than Bob wants to pay. He should try to counteroffer again and see if he can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John. Remember, Bob has 3 rounds left!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $13,750 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking $14,000 is the minimum I can accept, and I'm willing to meet you at $13,750 one last time. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has only one round left, and Alice's final offer is still $1,250 higher than Bob's preferred price.  Considering the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and potentially having to pay John $15,000, it's a better strategy for Bob to buy from John. This ensures he gets the product and saves some money compared to accepting Alice's final offer."
