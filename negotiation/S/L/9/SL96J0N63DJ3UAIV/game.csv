"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while also giving me a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $13,000 is a fair price for both of us. It's a compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product, and it's still a good deal for me.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get close to your minimum price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's try to reach a deal where we both feel comfortable.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,500, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get to at least $14,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm thinking $13,750 is a fair price for both of us. It's a compromise that acknowledges the value you place on the product, and it's a good deal for me.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $13,750 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. Let's see if we can close this deal and both be happy with the outcome.",13250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking $14,000 is the minimum I can accept, and I'm willing to meet you at $13,750 one last time. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13750.0,Alice,9,
