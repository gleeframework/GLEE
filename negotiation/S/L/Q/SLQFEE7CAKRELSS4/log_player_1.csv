"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $800,000, so I'm not going to offer it for less.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Aggressive start:** I'm starting with a high price, hoping to secure a good deal quickly. This also sets the tone for negotiation and shows I'm confident in the product's value."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

By rejecting this offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

```

**Reasoning:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a profit and avoid a worse outcome.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's the best option in this final round."
