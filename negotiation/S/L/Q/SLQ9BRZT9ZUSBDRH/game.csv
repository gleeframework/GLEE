"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That would still be a good deal for you and give me a fair price for the product.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's try one more time.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Can you accept that?",135.0,Bob,6,
