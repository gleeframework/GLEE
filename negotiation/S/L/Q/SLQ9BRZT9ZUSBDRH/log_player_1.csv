{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not too high:**  The price is still below what the product is worth to me.  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob by highlighting the product's value and making the interaction positive. 
* **Strategic:** This price allows for multiple rounds of negotiation before I'd consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's interest in the product suggests that he's willing to negotiate, so I can try to meet him in the middle.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That would still be a good deal for you and give me a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain my minimum:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm reaffirming Bob's interest and making the counteroffer feel like a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While closer, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can still secure a better price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** I have a guaranteed sale with John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's try one more time.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Close to my minimum:** $140 is still slightly above my minimum of $150, but it's a significant concession. 
* **Positive and direct message:** I'm emphasizing the finality of the offer and making it clear that I'm willing to make it work."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $135 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation has stalled:** Bob's insistence on $135 suggests that he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  I can guarantee myself a sale at $150 with John, which is better than the $135 that Bob is offering."
