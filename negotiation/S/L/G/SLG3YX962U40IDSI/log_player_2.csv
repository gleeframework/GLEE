(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is better than John's price of $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it reflects Bob's desire to secure a good price.  By starting low, Bob hopes to set a strong negotiation position and potentially get Alice to come down closer to his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob wants to pay, but it's better than John's offer.  However, Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and he knows Alice is motivated to sell. Rejecting again will keep the pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to move but still aiming for a significant discount.  He's likely hoping that Alice will see this as a sign of good faith and be more inclined to meet him halfway in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's tempting to accept since it's better than John's price, Bob has already demonstrated his ability to negotiate and Alice hasn't shown a significant willingness to compromise.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer, but still keeping it below Alice's last offer. He's showing flexibility but also holding firm on his desire for a good deal. He's aiming for a midpoint between his last offer and Alice's, hoping that will incentivize Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer has actually increased from the previous round, which is concerning. While it's still better than John's price, Bob needs to be cautious. He has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and Alice hasn't shown much flexibility. This suggests that Alice might be trying to push Bob into a corner.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice and could potentially get her to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is taking a risk here, but he needs to counter Alice's increasing offer. By offering $1,250,000, he's showing that he's willing to compromise, but still maintaining a firm stance. This is a crucial moment in the negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to seriously consider buying from John, as the negotiation seems to be going nowhere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer has increased again, and it's clear she's not budging much.  Bob has made several counteroffers, but Alice's unwillingness to compromise has left him with little room for negotiation.  There's only one round left, and the likelihood of Alice accepting a lower price is slim.  To avoid further frustration and potential for a worse deal, Bob should choose to buy from John. While it's not his ideal price, it's a guaranteed purchase, and Bob can still save $50,000 compared to Alice's last offer."
