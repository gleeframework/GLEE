"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I believe the product could be beneficial, the price point is currently too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the value. However, my original asking price reflects the true value and potential this product holds. I could consider coming down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $700,000 is still too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $1,700,000 is still a bigger investment than I had in mind. If you're truly motivated to sell, I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $850,000.  That's a significant offer on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,6,
