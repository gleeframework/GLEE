Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential surplus of $500,000 to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob before going to John.

**The Offer Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his $1,500,000 valuation) but also maximizes your gain.  

Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a limited opportunity can make it more appealing.
* **Value Emphasis:** Mentioning ""potential value"" subtly reinforces that it's worth more than your asking price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you ($350,000 above your minimum) while still saving Bob $150,000 compared to his valuation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly more generous offer could be beneficial. 

**Remember, this is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of the situation.**"
