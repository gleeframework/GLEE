You have three options:

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $11,500, and save money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $10,500 is a fair offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

While $11,000 is closer to your maximum price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a possibility that Alice will accept a price closer to your desired range."
