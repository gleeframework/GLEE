"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's within your budget, it's still a significant markup from her value ($800,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **There's no immediate urgency.** You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John.  This gives you leverage to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's price but still leaves her with a profit. It shows you're serious about buying but are willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on fairness:** Highlighting the product's value to her and your budget emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Leave room for counteroffers:**  The offer is not your absolute bottom line, allowing for potential compromises in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm putting on this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While she's come down from her initial offer, she's still asking for $100,000 more than your initial counteroffer and significantly more than her stated value.
* **There's still time to negotiate.** You have 7 rounds left, and the option to buy from John provides a safety net. 
* **A slight counteroffer is appropriate.**  You can show that you are willing to compromise but still want a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, which is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's reach an agreement and avoid going back and forth any further. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  This offer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing flexibility but still pushing for a better price. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  The message reiterates that the offer is fair for both parties and suggests reaching a quick agreement. 
* **Avoid Stalemate:**  The message implies that further negotiation might not be fruitful, subtly encouraging Alice to accept."
