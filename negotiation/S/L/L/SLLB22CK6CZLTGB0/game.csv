"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it could be a game-changer for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Given its value, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident you'd see a strong return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer to what I need, I can't accept anything less than $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident this is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
