"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product is quite unique and valuable, which is reflected in my pricing. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our two offers.  Would $1,375,000 be agreeable?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,325,000. This represents a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.  What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,325,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,312,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1312500.0,Bob,6,
