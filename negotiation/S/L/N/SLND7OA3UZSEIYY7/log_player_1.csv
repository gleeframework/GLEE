"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price, which allows for some back and forth to potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:** While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I can still potentially get a better price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Time and Rounds:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob I'm willing to compromise by lowering my price a bit.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, emphasizing that $125 is still a good deal.
* **Motivation:** By stating it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price, I'm motivating Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Could we possibly meet at $120? This would allow me to stay within my spending limit while still acquiring the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We're already in Round 4, and Bob is insistent on his $120 offer. 
* **Value to Me:** While $120 is my minimum, I've already compromised twice.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit that's significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price or wasting valuable rounds. 

It's best to secure the guaranteed profit with John and avoid the potential for further concessions."
