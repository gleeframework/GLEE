"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you making a move. However, $6,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. Could you do $10,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,4,
