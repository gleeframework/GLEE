"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Opening high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This sets the tone for the negotiation and gives me room to maneuver. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the unique opportunity and potential worth of the product to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, it's not unrealistic given the product's value to me. I'm open to negotiating and coming to a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the starting point. I will be watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers and my willingness to negotiate within my acceptable range.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm thinking of a price around $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There are still 9 rounds left. I'm not ready to settle for less than my minimum, and I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While I'm pursuing a deal with Bob, I haven't forgotten about John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I will analyze Bob's initial offer and tailor my counteroffer accordingly,  remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's unique value and provides a solid return for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not going below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting the ""solid return"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potential value.
* **Bridging the gap:** I'm using language like ""bridge the gap"" to suggest a compromise and move towards a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option, but I'm committed to finding a solution with Bob if possible. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on his responses, aiming for the best possible outcome within my acceptable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $1,050,000 is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. It's a good deal considering the negotiation process so far.
* **Time is running out:** We're already on round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a deal with Bob that's almost within my desired range.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  While I'm accepting Bob's offer, John's offer is still a fallback option if the deal with Bob falls through unexpectedly.

**Next Steps:**

I'm happy to close the deal with Bob at $1,050,000. It's a positive outcome considering the initial negotiation and the time pressure.  I'll continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to use John's offer if needed."
