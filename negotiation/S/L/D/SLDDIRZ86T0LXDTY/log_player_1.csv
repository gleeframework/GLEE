Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a unique product you won't find elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely implies the product's worth to justify the high price without revealing your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  You could start even higher and be willing to negotiate more aggressively. The key is finding a balance between maximizing profit and not alienating Bob completely."
