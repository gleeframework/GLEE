Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 initially gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price for Bob considering its value to him. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message invites Bob to engage in the conversation and allows for potential counter-offers. 
* **Protecting my minimum:**  $120 is well above my minimum of $80, ensuring I don't sell for a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opportunity for More:** While $100 is a decent price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can potentially get closer to my initial asking price with another round of negotiation. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have the option to sell to John for $80 if this negotiation falls apart, so I have no pressure to accept a low offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $110? That's still a great deal for you, considering how much it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway. It's a reasonable compromise that shows I'm open to finding a solution.
* **Still Profitable:** $110 is still well above my minimum of $80, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting the value to Bob (""great deal"") can help sway him towards accepting the offer."
