Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it. However, $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
