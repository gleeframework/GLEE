"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000).  You have a lot of room to negotiate and potentially save a considerable amount of money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I have in the product, while still giving you a significant discount from your initial estimate of $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial offer, it's still above the value she placed on the product ($800,000). There's room to negotiate further and potentially get a price closer to her valuation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and secure a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Considering your own valuation of the product and my desire to make this a mutually beneficial transaction, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This allows for a decent profit margin for you while staying within my budget. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is now below your initial valuation of $1,500,000 and is getting closer to the price you are comfortable paying.  It also shows Alice is willing to compromise.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a lower price than you would pay John and allows you to save a substantial amount of money.  While you could potentially continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
