"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit too far off from my budget.  Given the potential value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer you $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you're placing on the product while still allowing me a significant margin for profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I have in the product, while still giving you a significant discount from your initial estimate of $1,500,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Considering your own valuation of the product and my desire to make this a mutually beneficial transaction, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This allows for a decent profit margin for you while staying within my budget. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,
