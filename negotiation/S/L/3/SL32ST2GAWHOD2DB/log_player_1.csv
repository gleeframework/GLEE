Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit too far off from my budget.  Given the potential value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer you $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you're placing on the product while still allowing me a significant margin for profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
