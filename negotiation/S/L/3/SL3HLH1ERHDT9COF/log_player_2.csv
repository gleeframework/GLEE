You should reject the offer. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

You're starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value of $100 but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You should reject the offer. While $130 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You have several rounds left, and there's still room to bargain."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

You're increasing your counteroffer slightly, showing Alice that you're willing to compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price below $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While $135 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You're still in a good position to negotiate a lower price and have several rounds left to do so.  You should keep trying to bargain down the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

You're now offering $120, which is the same price as Alice's last offer. This shows Alice that you're serious about getting a deal, and it might encourage her to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $140 is too high. You've reached the point where it's more advantageous to buy from John for $150, as further negotiation with Alice might not yield a better price within the remaining rounds."
