Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $600,000 is far below the product's true value.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth to you.  What do you say?

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.  Let's finalize this deal and make this a win-win situation.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
