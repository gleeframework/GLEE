"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $90. This is a fair compromise, and it'll allow us both to get a good deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $92. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",92.0,Alice,5,
