Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing that it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  I'm confident that if Bob rejects, I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to split the difference with Bob and see if he'll accept a price closer to my ideal.  It's a compromise, but I still stand to make more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my ideal price that it's worth accepting.  While I'd prefer $9,500, I'm confident that negotiating further would likely only lead to more back-and-forth with no guarantee of a higher price.  It's better to lock in this sale and avoid the risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away."
