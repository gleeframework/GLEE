Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $150, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price, giving you some profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures you get more than his perceived value.
* **John as Backup:**  You have the security of John buying it for $150 if Bob refuses, so there's a low risk in aiming a bit lower with Bob."
