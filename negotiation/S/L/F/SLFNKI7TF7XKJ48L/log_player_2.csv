# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to reject and start negotiating. You can potentially get a better price from Alice or simply buy from John if negotiations fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This recognizes the value of the product while still providing a gain for you.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price point or potentially convince Alice to accept a price closer to my budget."
