"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it would be equally beneficial to your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000, which reflects its high value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This reflects a fair compromise and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is below the minimum I can accept for this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for both of us and gives us both a chance to make this deal work.  Let's find a solution that's mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is within my budget and is a good deal compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
