You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer is too high. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a good deal for me, but it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price. I will reject her offer and continue negotiating.  I'm not yet willing to buy from John at $1,200,000 as I believe I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying, but still staying below my maximum price.  I believe this will encourage her to come down in price."
