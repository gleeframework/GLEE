"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $1,000,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe the product holds more value, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is close enough to my desired price point.  While I would like to push for a higher price,  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer is the best choice for maximizing my earnings in this scenario."
