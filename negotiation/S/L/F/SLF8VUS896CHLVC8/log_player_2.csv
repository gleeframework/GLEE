"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have no information about Alice's minimum selling price. Accepting her offer means paying the maximum you are willing to pay, with no potential for saving money.  Since you can buy the product from John for the same price, it's better to go with John. There is no upside to negotiating with Alice in this scenario."
