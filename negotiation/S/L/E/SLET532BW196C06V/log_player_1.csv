Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price.  While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a little, and I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that leaves us both with a good deal. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,000,000 is a good deal and a significant profit. I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid further risk of losing the deal altogether."
