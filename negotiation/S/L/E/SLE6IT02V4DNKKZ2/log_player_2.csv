"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $1,500,000, which is your maximum price. However, John is also willing to sell it to you for the same price. 

Since both options cost the same, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. Rejecting it gives you the option to potentially negotiate with Alice later or explore other sellers in the future."
