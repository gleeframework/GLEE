We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While we could push for more, Bob is clearly trying to meet us somewhere in the middle. Accepting $1,220,000 is a significant gain over John's offer and a reasonable compromise at this stage."
