"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than our goal. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  We start with an aggressive counteroffer at Alice's value ($100). This gives us the most room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is crafted to maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $115 is still above our target. We have rounds to spare and can try to negotiate further. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about a lower price and encourage her to make further concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $105?  That's a good compromise."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We increase our offer by $5, showing Alice we are willing to negotiate, but we are still aiming for a price below her initial offer.
* **Finding the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer nudges the negotiation towards a potential agreement point.  It's important to make incremental progress. 
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The message continues to be respectful and solution-oriented to foster a collaborative atmosphere."
