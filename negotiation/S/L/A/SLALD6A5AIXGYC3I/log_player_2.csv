{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $170. It's clearly not a good deal for you. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You're offering Alice the maximum price you're willing to pay. This shows your sincerity while still getting the best possible deal for yourself."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still $15 above your maximum. You can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

You're offering $125, which is still within your budget and a reasonable compromise between your previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but also have a firm limit."
