Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) but lower than what it's worth to Bob ($120). This gives Bob room to negotiate and incentivizes him to try to reach an agreement rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price from $170 to $135, which is still higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but closer to Bob's offer of $120. This shows flexibility and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price ($150), so I'll accept his offer. It's a good compromise and ensures I make a profit."
