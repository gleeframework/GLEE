{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also sets a clear limit for what I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as it's likely he won't go higher. Selling to John at $150 is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirement."
