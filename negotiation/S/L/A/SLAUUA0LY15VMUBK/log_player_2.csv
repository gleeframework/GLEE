{""message"": ""Alice, your product is fantastic, but $1,400,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?
