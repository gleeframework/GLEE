"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is fantastic, but $1,400,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,300,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
