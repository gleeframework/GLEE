"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. I suggest $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. I propose $1,250,000. This still allows for a healthy profit for both of us.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $1,250,000 is slightly above my budget. I would like to suggest a price of $1,150,000 for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows me to achieve my goal while ensuring you get a great deal. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
