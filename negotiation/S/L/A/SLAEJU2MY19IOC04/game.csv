"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible product. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $650,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to let go of this product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
