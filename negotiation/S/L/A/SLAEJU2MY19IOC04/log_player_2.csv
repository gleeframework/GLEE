Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to let go of this product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $675,000.

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $650,000. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk she won't budge further. Accepting at $675,000 ensures we get the product at a significant saving compared to John's offer."
