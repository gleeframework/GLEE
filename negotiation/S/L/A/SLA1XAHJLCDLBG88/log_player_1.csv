**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has consistently shown a willingness to negotiate and meet me closer to the middle ground. Accepting $13,000 provides a $1,000 buffer over John's offer.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
