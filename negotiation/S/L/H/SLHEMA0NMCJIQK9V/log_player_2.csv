"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal.  There are 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm aiming to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've done my research and I believe the product is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Is this a more reasonable price for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's price, but there's still room for further negotiation. Bob should continue to push for a lower price. He has multiple rounds left and can still get a better deal than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the effort to find common ground, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but Bob is still further away from her price than she is from his.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob should continue to push for a lower price. He has a chance to get a better deal than the $1,075,000 offer, and buying from John for $1,200,000 is still a worse option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to make a final move. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,050,000. I've already made concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is firm:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Time is running out:**  There are only 3 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.
* **John's price is higher:**  Accepting Alice's offer is still cheaper than buying from John.

While Bob would prefer a lower price, accepting the $1,075,000 offer secures the product at a price that's within his budget and better than John's offer.  It's the most sensible choice given the current situation."
