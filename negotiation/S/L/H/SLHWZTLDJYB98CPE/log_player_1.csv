"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $100 for it. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I am still not able to pay more than $100 for the product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, it's clear Bob is unwilling to budge above $100.  Since you have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John, it makes the most sense to take that offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
