"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $850,000 is more than his maximum budget, and there's room to negotiate. He can try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $800,000? That's the minimum I can accept, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge again, and he risks losing the product. Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at his desired price point."
