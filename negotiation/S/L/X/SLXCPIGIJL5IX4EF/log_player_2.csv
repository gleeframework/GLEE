"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I believe you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, it's always worth trying to negotiate. There's no information about the value of the product to Alice, so there's potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $1,500,000 to $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction and represents a good deal for Bob. While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower, given her statement that this is her ""best price"".  Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John, and still gets him the product within his budget."
