Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer, which might encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further, but I'm not giving away the entire profit margin in the first offer. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or go too low, I can always switch to John.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** I'm prepared to negotiate and counteroffer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,450,000.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Selling to John would mean leaving $200,000 on the table. It's more strategic to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my ideal price, but still below his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This would give us both a fair deal, and we can close this transaction quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** I'm mentioning a quick close to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Balance:** I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a deal with Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still aware of John's offer, but I believe a higher price with Bob is more beneficial.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to adjust my counteroffer based on Bob's response, but I won't accept anything significantly lower than $1,350,000."
