"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is far too high. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. I believe this price reflects the value I've placed on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. There's room for further negotiation.  Bob should try to get closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1400000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $1500000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I've placed on the product and the potential benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's counteroffer of $1,700,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While there might be further negotiation, Bob has reached a point where the risk of further negotiation potentially pushing the price higher than his budget is too great. It's safer and more financially sensible to buy from John at $1,200,000."
