"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1300000. I believe this is a fair price, given the potential benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. I believe this price reflects the value I've placed on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1600000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1400000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $1500000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I've placed on the product and the potential benefits it offers.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
