Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground.  While I appreciate the value, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  This feels like a fair offer considering its potential worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

We're still very far apart in valuation. Bob's offer is too low, and we have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price significantly to $1,700,000.  This is a large concession on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair offer considering the value this product brings."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, anything much over $800,000 just doesn't make sense for me. I'm willing to offer you $750,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Bob has made it clear he won't go much higher than his current offer.  It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap between $750,000 and our minimum of $1,500,000.  John's offer guarantees us our desired profit."
