"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some middle ground.  While I appreciate the value, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  This feels like a fair offer considering its potential worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price significantly to $1,700,000.  This is a large concession on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, anything much over $800,000 just doesn't make sense for me. I'm willing to offer you $750,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
