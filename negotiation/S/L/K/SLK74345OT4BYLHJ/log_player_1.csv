Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and an example offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because John is guaranteed to buy the product for $800,000. This gives you leverage.
* **Bob's Perspective:** The product's value to Bob is also $800,000.  He gains no surplus value unless he can buy it for less.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $800,000 (your minimum) and $800,000 (Bob's maximum). This means there's no room for negotiation unless you create value elsewhere.

**Strategies**

1. **High Anchor with Justification:**  Start with a price significantly higher than $800,000, providing a strong justification for the premium. This anchors the negotiation in your favor.

2. **Value-Based Negotiation:** Instead of focusing solely on price, explore if there are other elements you can offer to sweeten the deal for Bob without lowering the price.

**Example Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This includes [mention additional services or benefits, e.g., priority support, exclusive access to related resources, etc., to justify the higher price]. I'm confident this represents a valuable investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Bob remains unwilling to meet a price that's acceptable to you, remember you have John as a guaranteed buyer. 
* **Build Rapport:**  A positive and collaborative tone can go a long way in negotiations.

**Remember:** This is just one approach. The specific price and message you choose will depend on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob's willingness to pay a premium."
