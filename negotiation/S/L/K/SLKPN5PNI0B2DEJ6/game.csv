"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth at least $10000 to me.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, considering it's worth $8000 to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, which is the highest I can go.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10200. This is my final offer.",10200.0,Bob,6,
