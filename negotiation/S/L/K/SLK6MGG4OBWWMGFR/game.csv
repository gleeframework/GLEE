"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This price still gives you a significant advantage, and I'm willing to compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to propose a price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point.  While I still feel $875,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's meet at $890,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose a price of $880,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",880000.0,Bob,6,
