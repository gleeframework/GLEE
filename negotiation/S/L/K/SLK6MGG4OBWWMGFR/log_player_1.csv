Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This price still gives you a significant advantage, and I'm willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to propose a price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

While $875,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to push for a bit more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point.  While I still feel $875,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's meet at $890,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose a price of $880,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.

While I'm a little disappointed not to get closer to my ideal price, $880,000 is a solid deal.  We're nearing the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer completely.  I'll accept his offer."
