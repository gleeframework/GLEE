"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is still a bit low for me. I can do $135, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
