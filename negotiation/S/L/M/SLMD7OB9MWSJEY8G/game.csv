"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and still allows for a healthy profit for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is tempting, I believe it undervalues some of the key benefits it offers.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
