``` 
 
This offer is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers, and leaves me a good profit if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I am willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that low. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  That gives you a good deal and keeps me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that John is a guaranteed buyer for $10,000. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
