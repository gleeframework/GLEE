Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price.

While $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still too high for my budget. I'll need to counter again to try and find a more agreeable price."
