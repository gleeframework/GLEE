Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $850,000 at this time.  This price reflects my current financial situation and my desire to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. I need to try and negotiate a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to facilitate this deal.  This price still leaves room for a profitable outcome for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. I believe it's a good starting point for finding a mutually beneficial solution. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to that number."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm committed to making this deal work, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my current budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.
