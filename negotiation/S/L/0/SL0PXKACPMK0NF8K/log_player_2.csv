Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is still a little below what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but $12,000 would be a fair compromise for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice is showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is a good price, saving me $3,000 from my maximum and likely close to the best I can do."
