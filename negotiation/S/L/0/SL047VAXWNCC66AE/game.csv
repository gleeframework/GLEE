"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's work together to make this happen.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While I do see the value in the product, my budget is closer to $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to negotiating, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,250?  It's a good compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to budge a little more. Would you consider $14,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
