{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $85? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, considering the cost and quality of the product, I am unable to accept $85. My counteroffer is $90. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to achieve a reasonable profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

You can save $10 by accepting Alice's offer of $90.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept a lower price, and you risk ending up buying from John for $100."
