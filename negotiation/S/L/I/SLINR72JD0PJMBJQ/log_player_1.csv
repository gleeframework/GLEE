Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,190,000. I believe it presents a significant value proposition at this price point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Knowing John acts as a price floor ($1,200,000), Alice should aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While close to the guaranteed sale price, offering it slightly lower  ($1,190,000) might entice Bob without significantly impacting Alice's profit. This approach seeks to capture the maximum possible value from Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. It hinges on his perception of the product's value and his willingness to pay a premium over his estimated worth ($800,000)."
