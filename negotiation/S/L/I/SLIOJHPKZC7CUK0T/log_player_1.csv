Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is close to the middle ground between our minimum acceptable price and Bob's potential value. It allows for some room to negotiate but still secures a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
