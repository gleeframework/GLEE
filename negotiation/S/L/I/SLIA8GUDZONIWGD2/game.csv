"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $175?",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $190. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",190.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $190. Would you be willing to consider a price of $180?",180.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $185. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $190, so I'm offering it to you for $185. This is my final offer.",185.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $185. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm sorry to say that $120 is way below my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell it to you for that amount. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $120, so I'm offering it to you for $135. This is my final offer.",135.0,Alice,9,
