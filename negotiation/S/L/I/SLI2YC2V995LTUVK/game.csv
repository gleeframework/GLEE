"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. It's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you meet me in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600000 is far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1200000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I can do $900000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession - let's settle at $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd like to make one last offer of $950000. If you can meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",950000.0,Bob,6,
