"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle and offer $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I get a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer and offer $9,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $9,375. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,375 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to finalize this deal at $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this happen.",9250.0,Bob,8,
