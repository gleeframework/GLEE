,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's try to make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. ",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $107.50 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $109? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $109 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $108?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. ",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $108.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll get us both out of this negotiation. Let's close this deal!",108.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  Would you be willing to come down to $107? This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's finalize this now.",107.0,Bob,8,
