"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the fact that I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to walk away if we can't reach an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1025000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1025000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $980000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
