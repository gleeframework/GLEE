"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $22,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm looking for. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $18,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, but that's my absolute floor. It's a significant discount and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Alice,5,
