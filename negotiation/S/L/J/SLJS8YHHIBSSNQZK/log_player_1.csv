Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $22,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.
