Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.  I believe Bob will be motivated to negotiate since he values the product at $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe I can get. I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to secure a price that's closer to my initial asking price.  Hopefully this will be a sweet spot for both of us."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $10,000 below my initial asking price.  While I'd love to push for more, I'm not confident I'll get a better offer from Bob. Accepting his offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
