{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since your maximum budget is $15,000, Alice's initial offer is good, but there's room to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is significantly lower than her initial offer but still leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows me to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate but still trying to get a price closer to my target.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my target price, and we're already halfway through the rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation. It's unlikely I can get a much lower price from Alice, and I want to avoid buying from John at a higher price."
