Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.  It's also important to emphasize the value of the product to try and get Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will proceed with a counteroffer to try and find a price that is more beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $60 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
