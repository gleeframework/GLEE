"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget concerns, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? It's a fair price that allows you to stay within your budget while providing me with a reasonable return.  What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
