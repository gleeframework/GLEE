"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $1,050,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay.  There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  He's still within his budget and can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
