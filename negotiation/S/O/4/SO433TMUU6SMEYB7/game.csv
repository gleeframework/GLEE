"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However, $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
