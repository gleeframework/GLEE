Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to build rapport.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:**  This price allows for a counteroffer from Bob without me immediately needing to lower my price significantly.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm confident that I can get a better deal, or I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little bit more.  How about $135? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but not going back to my original asking price. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Compromise Language:**  I'm using language that emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" to make my counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if Bob isn't willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Significant Upside:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($130).  There's no guarantee I can push him higher, and I risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Further negotiation could drag on, and I'm not sure how much time I'm willing to invest in this. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but I'd rather get something now than wait. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that is almost at my desired minimum. It's a good outcome considering the back-and-forth."
