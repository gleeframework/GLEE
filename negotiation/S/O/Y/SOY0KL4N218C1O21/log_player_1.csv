Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset worth well over a million, and I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,200,000 is still a significant amount below my minimum, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to show my commitment to making this deal work.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and it's likely he won't go any higher.  I'm confident I can find a buyer who will pay more, but I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely.  $1,350,000 is a good compromise and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
