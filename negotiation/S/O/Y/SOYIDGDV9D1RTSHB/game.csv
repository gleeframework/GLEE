"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth $10,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $15,000. How about $14,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. ",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $14,250? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let me know what you think.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my limits. How about $13,750? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",13750.0,Bob,6,
