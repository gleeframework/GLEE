Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a relatively high price to see if I can get a quick deal. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  Remember, I have a safety net with John willing to pay $150, so I don't have to settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm happy Bob is interested, $100 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for anything less than $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$125:** This is a compromise price that is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($100). 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly but emphasizes that $100 is not acceptable. It also offers a specific counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. By offering $125, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate my options, potentially considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $125 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel it's a bit high. Could we perhaps agree on $110? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to my minimum price of $150, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $125. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob rejects that, I will sell the product to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a great deal, and I respect that.  However, I can't go lower than $125.  I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at this price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer, or we can unfortunately part ways."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$125:** I'm sticking with my previous offer as it's the closest I'm willing to go to Bob's price.
* **Message:** I'm being firm but still friendly. I'm letting Bob know that this is my final offer, but leaving the door open for him to accept.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm pushing for a deal close to my minimum. If Bob doesn't agree, I'm prepared to sell to John and walk away. It's important to stick to my minimum price to ensure I get a good deal."
