"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $125 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel it's a bit high. Could we perhaps agree on $110? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a great deal, and I respect that.  However, I can't go lower than $125.  I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at this price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer, or we can unfortunately part ways.",125.0,Alice,5,
