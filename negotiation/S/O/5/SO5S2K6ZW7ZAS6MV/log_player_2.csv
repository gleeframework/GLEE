"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny.  I know you're a discerning buyer, so I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is the same price as John's, there is no incentive to accept it. You can get the product from John for the same price, and by rejecting Alice's offer, you may be able to leverage the situation to get a better price from Alice in the future."
