This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting a $375,000 discount from Alice's initial offer and a significant savings compared to John's price.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice sticking to her price or the negotiation breaking down, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price."
