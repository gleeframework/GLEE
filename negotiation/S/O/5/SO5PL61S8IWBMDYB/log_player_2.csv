"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a truly unique item that I'm confident you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value of $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.  A counteroffer will allow Bob to try and secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal compared to what you could get elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved her offer up to $1,300,000, but that's still within the range of negotiation. Bob can likely get a lower price if he continues to counter. It's still cheaper than buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the value you'll get from it.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $1,300,000 to $1,250,000.  This is still a higher price than Bob's last counteroffer of $1,150,000, so there's room for further negotiation. It's also still cheaper than buying from John.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
