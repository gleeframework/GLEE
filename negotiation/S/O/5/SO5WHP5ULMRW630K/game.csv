"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,750,000 is still a little high for me.  Could you do $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
