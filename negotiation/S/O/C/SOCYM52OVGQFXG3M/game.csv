"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's closer to your last offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
