"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your valuation, this product holds significant value and potential beyond the $1,600,000 mark.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is my initial offer. I'm not willing to go above that price. Can we meet at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
