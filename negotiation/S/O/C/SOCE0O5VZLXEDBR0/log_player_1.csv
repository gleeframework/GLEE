Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This gives Bob the opportunity to counter without feeling like he's being pushed too hard.
* **John as a backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides me with a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is too low. While it's tempting to take it, I'm aiming to earn as much as possible. My minimum acceptable price is $12,000, and I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at that price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Negotiate further:**  Counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable compromise closer to my target. 
* **Use John as leverage:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is closer to Bob's initial offer but still above his desired price. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining some of my original asking price.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing reasons for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and the discount I'm already offering.
* **Keeping the door open:**  I'm not shutting the door on a deal with Bob, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,250. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still a bit below my ideal, it's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can still make a decent profit.  

Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Close to my minimum:**  $10,250 is within a reasonable range of my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for future business:**  Accepting this offer could build a relationship with Bob for potential future sales.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might have to settle for John's offer of $12,000, which would be less profitable. 

I'm willing to take a slight compromise to secure the sale and build a potentially valuable relationship with Bob."
