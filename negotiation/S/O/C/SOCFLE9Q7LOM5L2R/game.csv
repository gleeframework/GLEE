"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $1,300,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see the value of the product is high for you, but I also need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
