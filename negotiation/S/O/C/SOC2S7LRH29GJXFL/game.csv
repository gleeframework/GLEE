"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,500. It's a fair price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can finalize this.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle one last time. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,750,  which is a fair compromise for both of us. This is my final offer.",12750.0,Bob,6,
