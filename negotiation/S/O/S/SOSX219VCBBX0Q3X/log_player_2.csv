Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125, and it's not worth the risk of her ending the negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the product at your target price."
