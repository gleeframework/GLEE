"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I know I can get it from another seller for that price, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",14000.0,Bob,4,
