Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale to John at that price, I want to start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer of $1,900,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might try to haggle the price down, and I can then strategically concede a bit, potentially still landing above my minimum. 
* **Confident language:** The message aims to convey value and subtly create a sense of urgency (""unique nature"", ""significant investment""). This could nudge Bob towards accepting the offer quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on my knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, I might adjust my approach."
