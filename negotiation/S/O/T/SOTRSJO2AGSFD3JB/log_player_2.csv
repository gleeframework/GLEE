"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000) and a good deal.  There's no need to risk further negotiation, especially since you don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price."
