"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer allows space for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly anchoring the price in Bob's mind.
 
This strategy aims to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while leaving us options to adjust in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While selling to John is an option, we still have room to negotiate with Bob.  We'll counter with a price closer to our minimum, aiming to gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000. This is a fair offer considering the immense potential this product offers you."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection of Low Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, we demonstrate that we're serious about getting a fair price.
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** Our counteroffer drops substantially from our initial ask but remains significantly above our $800,000 minimum and John's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Reiteration of Value:** We continue emphasizing the product's value to Bob, justifying the higher price. 

This strategy balances firmness with flexibility, keeping the negotiation alive while pushing towards a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counteroffer at $825,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price and a reasonable profit above John's offer. While we might be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or become less flexible. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
