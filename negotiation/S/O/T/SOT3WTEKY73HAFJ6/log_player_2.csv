"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,000,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price. He has a strong position as he has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than his maximum budget. This counteroffer allows for some wiggle room in the negotiation, but also puts pressure on Alice to consider a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, Bob has exhausted his options for negotiation with Alice. He's better off purchasing the product from John for his maximum price of $800,000."
