Bob's offer is very close to my minimum threshold, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I've already negotiated for several rounds, and it's becoming clear that we might not be able to reach an agreement. To avoid further delays and ensure I get my desired price, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000."
