Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to get as much above that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still exceeding your minimum price. 
* **Justify the Price:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, aiming too high could make Bob immediately lose interest. This offer balances risk and potential reward."
