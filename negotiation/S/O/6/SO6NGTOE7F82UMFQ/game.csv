"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. To start the conversation, I propose a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to benefit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. To be honest,  $1,350,000 is a bit of a stretch for me right now. Would you be open to $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but that price point doesn't reflect the full potential of the product.  Let's settle on $1,250,000. This offers a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
