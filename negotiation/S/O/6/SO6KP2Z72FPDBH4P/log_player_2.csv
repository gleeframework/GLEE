# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is offering a price lower than her value, there's room for negotiation to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

We start with a significantly lower counteroffer to test Alice's flexibility.  There's a chance she accepts, but even if she rejects it, this sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle and offer the product for $65? This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, but we're still aiming to get closer to $60. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $63 is a fair offer, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 63
}
``` 

We inch closer to a price we find acceptable. This shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we could find common ground, Bob. Considering your offer, how about we set the product price at $64? This allows us to both feel satisfied with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $64. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $64
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we've managed to negotiate a price well below her value.  $64 is a good deal, and further haggling might risk losing the deal altogether."
