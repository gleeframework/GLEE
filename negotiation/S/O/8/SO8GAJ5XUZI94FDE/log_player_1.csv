Round 4

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving closer to a reasonable price point. We're still significantly above John's offer, so the risk of selling to John is low.  We have room to negotiate further and try to secure a higher price from Bob."

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could push for more, Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and this offer is a strong price. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or us accidentally pushing him away. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk ending up with John's lower offer."
