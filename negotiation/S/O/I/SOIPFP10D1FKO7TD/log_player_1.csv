{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $115, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still earning more than my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for you, and it still allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
