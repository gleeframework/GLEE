"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be upfront -  $975,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. This product is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment.  I'm willing to consider $1,000,000, but that's my absolute best offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and what I've offered so far.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position and I want to make this deal work. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Let's split the difference - $990,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $990,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $985,000, as I mentioned earlier. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting and the market conditions. I'd appreciate it if you could accept this offer.",985000.0,Bob,8,
