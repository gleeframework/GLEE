Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $990,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $985,000, as I mentioned earlier. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting and the market conditions. I'd appreciate it if you could accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000.

At this point, Bob is very unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's clear that we won't reach a deal that satisfies my desired profit margin. Accepting his current offer would mean a substantial loss compared to John's offer. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale."
