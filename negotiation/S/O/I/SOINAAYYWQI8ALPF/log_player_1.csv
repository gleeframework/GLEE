"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant amount less than Bob's estimated value, but it still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can secure a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,380,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but it's still a significant profit for me.  This should encourage Bob to come up a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not as high as I initially hoped, it's still above my minimum and is a good deal considering the limited rounds left. There's a risk of losing more ground in further negotiations, and selling to John would result in a lower profit."
