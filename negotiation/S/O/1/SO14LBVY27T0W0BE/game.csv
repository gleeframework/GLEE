"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to meet my minimum. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
