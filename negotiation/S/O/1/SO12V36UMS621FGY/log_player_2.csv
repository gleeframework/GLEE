"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than the $12,000 John is offering, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth trying to lower the price further before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $7,500. However, it's still a better price than what John is offering. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's possible to continue negotiating, but the potential savings are diminishing. At this point, it's not worth the risk of losing the product to John, who is willing to sell at a slightly higher price. It's more prudent for Bob to secure the product from John for $12,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
