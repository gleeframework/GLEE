Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  I'm offering it to you for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, the strategy is to aim for a price closer to your guaranteed sale. 
* **Urgency and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and introduces a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering slightly below your guaranteed price allows a small buffer for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit."
