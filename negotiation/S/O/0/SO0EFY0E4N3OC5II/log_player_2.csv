"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a much lower price from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but still higher than Alice's minimum value of $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a considerable amount of money. It's also a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. This price is significantly lower than the $15,000 that John is offering, making Alice's offer the better option.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there is a chance that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob might end up buying from John at a higher price."
