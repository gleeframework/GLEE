"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You want to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still get the product for a lower price than $100. You're better off rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $95?  I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it shows we're both willing to compromise. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal.  It's a good deal for you, and you're likely to save more money by accepting than by risking further negotiation."
