"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $85. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is asking for $85, which is too much. I'll see if I can get a better deal from John.
