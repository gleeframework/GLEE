Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm going to start high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping to get. I'll counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows some flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still staying above my minimum goal. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price, as it's significantly better than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm getting impatient. While I prefer to get a higher price, I'm confident that John will be willing to pay my minimum. It's not the best price, but it's secure and reliable."
