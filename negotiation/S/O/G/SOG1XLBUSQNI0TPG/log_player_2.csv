# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it hard to get a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

This seems like the time to take the deal.  Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line, and while another round *might* get it lower, it also risks her walking away. At $875,000 we're well below John's offer and saving a significant amount."
