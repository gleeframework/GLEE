"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it hard to get a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $850,000? That's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
