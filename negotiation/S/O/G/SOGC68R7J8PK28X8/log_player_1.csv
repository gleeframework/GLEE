"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening position, and allows for some room to negotiate. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us a chance to assess his interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer to try and find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $900,000. This is a substantial drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  I believe this price is a reasonable compromise and could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There are still rounds to go, and I don't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $850,000.  This price is still above my minimum acceptable value, and it's a significant increase from Bob's last offer.  I hope this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There are still rounds to go, and I don't want to settle too early.  I believe we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm now at my minimum acceptable value, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still not meeting my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
