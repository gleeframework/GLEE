```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value for the product is $150.  I'm hoping Bob is willing to pay a bit more, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer of $175 is higher than John's offer of $150. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option to maximize my earnings."
