"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a competitive price of $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While you could reject Alice's offer hoping for a lower price, there's a risk she won't go lower. Accepting her offer at $14,000 saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. It's better to secure a good deal than risk overpaying."
