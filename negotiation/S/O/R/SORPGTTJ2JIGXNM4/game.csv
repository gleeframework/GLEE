"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $108? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal.",108.0,Alice,3,
