"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my minimum price of $120 through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $125, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping Bob will come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counter-offering with my minimum price of $120.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, as it's a fair price for him considering the value he places on the product. This will allow me to reach my target price and avoid selling to John."
