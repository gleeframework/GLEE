"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  $1,500,000 is a significant markup, but it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for such a drastic discount, even considering the limited rounds. I need to try and push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with the minimum I'm willing to accept, $1,200,000.  This gives me a decent profit while also giving Bob a chance to come closer to my initial offer.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, even considering the limited rounds. I'm going to try and counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still securing a profit above my minimum acceptable price.  It's a compromise, but it's still a decent deal for me and leaves some room for Bob to counter if he's serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, his offer is still too low. I'm going to try to push for a better price by making another counteroffer. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and indicates a willingness to reach a deal. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my valuation.  With only a few rounds left, I need to decide if I'm willing to risk selling to John or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting down to the wire, and Bob's offers are still below my desired price. With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can get him to meet my expectations.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
