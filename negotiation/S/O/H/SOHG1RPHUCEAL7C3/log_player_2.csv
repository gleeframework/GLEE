"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $900,000 is still a bit more than Bob's budget, and there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

Bob is willing to pay $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and still within Bob's budget. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, but there's still room to negotiate.  Bob can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

Bob is willing to pay $860,000, which is a little more than his previous offer, but still below Alice's current offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is high.  It's more prudent for Bob to purchase the product from John at his guaranteed price of $800,000."
