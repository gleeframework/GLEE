"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and your interest, I propose a price of $9500 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can start a negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your interest in selling me the product.  However, I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a reasonable decrease from Alice's offer, but still within Bob's budget. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget and the value you place on the product, I am willing to adjust my offer to $9200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue the negotiation and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a little too high.  How about $9,100?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible.  He's only asking for a small decrease from Alice's offer, showing he's serious about buying the product but also wants to save a few more dollars."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if I can accommodate you further. My counteroffer is $9150 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,150 is very close to Bob's target price of $9,000, and significantly better than John's offer of $10,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to accept a worse deal from John.  It's a good compromise and a solid deal for Bob."
