"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
