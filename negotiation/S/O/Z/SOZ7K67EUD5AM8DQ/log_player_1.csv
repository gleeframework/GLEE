"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I know it's a valuable asset and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves room for negotiation, allowing for potential counteroffers and a win-win situation. 
* **Keeping John as an Option:** This price is still significantly higher than John's offer, keeping John as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. My counteroffer would be $1400000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,500,000, making it the more financially secure option.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  While rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not giving up on the deal entirely. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price that better reflects the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,600,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing that it's too low. 
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the benefit of the product for Bob, reminding him that this is a good deal. 
* **Setting Expectations:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation but won't go below a certain threshold.
* **Maintaining Option:**  This counteroffer still keeps John's offer in the background as a potential fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1500000. This is a fair compromise between our positions, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 exactly matches my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Upside:** There's no reason to believe Bob will increase his offer further, and rejecting it would likely lead to a lengthy negotiation with no guarantee of a higher price.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the desired $1,500,000, eliminating the risk of a failed negotiation or having to sell to John."
