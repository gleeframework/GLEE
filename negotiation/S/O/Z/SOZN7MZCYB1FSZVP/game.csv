"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,320,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,250,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,280,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems like we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,265,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",1265000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that splitting the difference is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to let it go for $1,265,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,280,000 and $1,250,000, which is $1,265,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,260,000.
