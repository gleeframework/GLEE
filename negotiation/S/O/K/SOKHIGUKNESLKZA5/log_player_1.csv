Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching up, but we're still far apart. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $1,300,000 or higher.  We're not in a rush, and selling to John is always a fallback option."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Bob's increases are getting smaller. He's clearly feeling the pressure.  We're only $25,000 away from our minimum acceptable price. Let's hold firm for one more round and see if he'll budge closer to $1,300,000."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has hit his limit and is no longer increasing his offer. Holding out for more from Bob risks losing both offers. John provides a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is our minimum acceptable price.  It's time to take the guaranteed win."
