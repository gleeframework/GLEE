"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me is significantly higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the item."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,500 is also below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob can get the same product from John for $8,000, so he should choose to buy from John."
