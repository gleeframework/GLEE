Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm open to offers, but I'm thinking around $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price above your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary. The friendly message encourages Bob to engage and provides a starting point for discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you're still aiming to make more. Rejecting allows you to counter with a slightly higher price and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer! While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I can only consider offers up to $90. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is below your minimum acceptable price. Since you can sell to John for $100, it's more beneficial to take that option rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
