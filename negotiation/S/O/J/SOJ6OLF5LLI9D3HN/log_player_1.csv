"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm being friendly and positive to build rapport.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message implies that I'm open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum ($150), it's still below my threshold.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I'm not desperate for a sale, and I believe I can secure a better price.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about $120? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm again leaving the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** While I could sell to John for $150, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's still a chance I could get closer to my desired price. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($95). This shows a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language like ""good deal"" and ""fair compromise"" to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price is good for both of us. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $107.50 is still above my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below my minimum price of $150.  At this point, the negotiations are going in a direction that's not beneficial to me. There's a high risk that further negotiation won't lead to a price I'm comfortable with. 

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150. This guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further rounds with Bob that might lead to a lower price."
