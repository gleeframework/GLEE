Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $11,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $13,000.  At this point, John's offer of $12,000 is the best deal and saves further negotiation."
