,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I was thinking more along the lines of 95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go up to $92.50, which would split the difference even further. This would still allow you to make a reasonable profit, while getting me a better price.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate the offer. However, I'm still a bit short on my target profit margin. I'm willing to meet you at 94, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $94 is still a bit high for me. Let's aim for $93, which is a reasonable compromise for both of us.  It gives you a good margin, and I get a better price.  What do you say?",93.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not quite there on my target profit margin. I'm willing to meet you at 95, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This would give me a decent profit and still be a good deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd consider.",95.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me. We're down to the wire here with only a few rounds left, and I'm still hoping to reach a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $94.50, which is a small increase from my previous offer and would allow you to make a fair profit.  Let's find a way to close this deal before time runs out!",94.5,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a deal. I'm still not quite there on my target profit margin, but I'm willing to make one final offer. I'm willing to meet you at 96, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This would give me a decent profit and still be a good deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd consider.",96.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still hoping to find a way to close this deal that works for both of us.  With just one round left, I'm willing to go up to $95.50.  This would give you a good profit while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",95.5,Bob,10,
