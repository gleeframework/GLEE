"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's perceived value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and lower the price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a critical point in the negotiation. Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $10,750, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since Bob has 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a worse deal than he could get from John.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $8,000 and secure the best possible price."
