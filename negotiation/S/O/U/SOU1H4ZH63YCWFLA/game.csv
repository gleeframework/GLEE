"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $8,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is the best I can do.",10750.0,Alice,5,
