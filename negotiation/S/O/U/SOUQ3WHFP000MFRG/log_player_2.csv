"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your desired price point. You have the opportunity to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John for a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to explore these options."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $950,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you are willing to pay.  John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is the most you're willing to pay.  It makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
