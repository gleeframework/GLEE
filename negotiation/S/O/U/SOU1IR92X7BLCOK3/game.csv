"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm not sure I can go that low right now. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the potential value, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident that you'll find the product to be worth the investment. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $750000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $795000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
