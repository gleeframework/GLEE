Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
