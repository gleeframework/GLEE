"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. Let's compromise further. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, my final offer. This is a fantastic deal on a product you won't regret owning.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a compromise. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, my absolute final offer. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
