You can do better than $95.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

I'm offering $85. This is a fair price, as it's still above Alice's value of $80.  Let's see if she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Let's try another counteroffer. $90 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial $85 offer."

I'm going to offer $88. This is a compromise,  a bit higher than my previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. I'm hopeful this will be agreeable to her."
