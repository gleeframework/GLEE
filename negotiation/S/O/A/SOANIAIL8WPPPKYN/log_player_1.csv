Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation but is still significantly higher than my minimum of $80. I believe it's a fair starting point that will incentivize Bob to negotiate without immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price of $90.  This demonstrates flexibility while still leaving room for negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $88 is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it.  It's more profitable than selling to John, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price."
