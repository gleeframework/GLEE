Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage with Bob. Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) aims to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Polite and Professional:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and inviting Bob to consider the offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above $15,000. A very high initial offer might discourage him from negotiating at all.
* **Market Dynamics:** This scenario assumes a simple market with only a few players.  In reality, there might be other potential buyers and factors influencing the price."
