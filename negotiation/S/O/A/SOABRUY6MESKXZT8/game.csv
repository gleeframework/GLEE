"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to compromise at $1,075,000, which is still a discount from my original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
