"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's true value of $1,200,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. He has a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,000,000, so he has room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While your product is intriguing, I'm going to need a lower price to make this work for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  The goal is to get Alice to lower her price considerably. 
* **Strong Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for his offer, making it seem less arbitrary. He acknowledges the product's value while indicating a need for a lower price to make the purchase viable.
* **Negotiation Space:**  By offering $950,000, there is still room for both parties to compromise and reach an agreement within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 lower than John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's minimal potential for further price reduction. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might not budge further, leaving Bob with a worse deal than John's.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Buying from John guarantees a lower price and eliminates the risk of negotiation.  

Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, and John's offer provides a guaranteed way to achieve that."
