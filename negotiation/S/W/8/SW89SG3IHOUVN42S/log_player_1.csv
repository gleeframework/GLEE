Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to increase his willingness to pay.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum as possible, while also leaving room for a few rounds of negotiation. 
* I'm prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low, as I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay my full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, there's a chance I can secure a higher price with Bob through further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, while acknowledging Bob's lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a price I can realistically work with."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but making it clear that it's not acceptable.  
* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a middle ground, splitting the difference between our two previous offers.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit to Bob of getting a substantial discount.
* **Staying firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still holding firm to a price that's closer to my minimum.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, as it shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the product for a drastically low price. 
* If Bob rejects again, I might be prepared to lower my offer slightly further, but I won't go below $1,200,000 without reconsidering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob is getting closer, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob yet.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between his current offer and my minimum. I might suggest $1,200,000 as a compromise, highlighting the value the product holds for him and emphasizing that this is my final offer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $1,150,000 is still too far below what I need. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, considering the value this product holds for you. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, hoping to incentivize him to accept.
* **Threat of Selling to John:**  I'm subtly threatening to sell to John if Bob doesn't agree, highlighting the potential loss for him.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm coming down slightly from my previous offer, showing flexibility but still remaining above my minimum.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a quick resolution. This offer is a compromise but still within a reasonable range. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll likely sell to John to avoid further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
