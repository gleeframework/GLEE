"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, at least $1500000. However, I believe it holds even greater potential for the right buyer. I'm offering it to you for $1800000.  This price reflects the value I see in it, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know if you're interested, and we can schedule a time to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.
