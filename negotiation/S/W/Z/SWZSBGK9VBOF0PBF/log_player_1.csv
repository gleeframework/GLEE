"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and suggesting the product is valuable to Bob. This helps build rapport and sets a positive tone.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, which encourages him to engage in the conversation and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $100.
* **More rounds to play:** I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price.
* **Value to Bob:** Remember, this product is worth $120 to Bob. There's still potential for him to increase his offer. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $90 and $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  How about $95?  That gives you a great deal, and it helps me get closer to my goal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counteroffering at $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate that $95 is a ""great deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth to him. 
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and positive tone, encouraging continued negotiation.

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between pushing for a higher price and maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the deal:**  Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my ideal price of $100, and I've already negotiated for several rounds. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly higher price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject his offer and continue negotiating, I risk Bob walking away entirely. There's also a chance I won't be able to get a higher price in the remaining rounds.
* **Safe and profitable:** Selling for $92 is a safe and profitable option, considering my minimum acceptable price is $80. 

This is a good point to finalize the deal and secure the profit."
