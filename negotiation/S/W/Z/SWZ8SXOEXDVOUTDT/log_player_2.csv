# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product for a price of $950,000. I believe it's a fair and competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to secure a lower price and save more money.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she values the product at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm aiming to pay a bit less.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects a significant discount while still offering you a fair price. I believe this is a good starting point for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. This price still represents a significant discount from the product's true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant discount from the original price and  leaves room for Bob to still save money compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting and then potentially asking for a higher price is a factor.  Accepting the offer guarantees a purchase at a good price."
