"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 9 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by showing Alice you are serious about buying the product but are working within a strict budget.  $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above your absolute limit.  This allows room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I can still get the product for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  That's a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about buying this product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to move the negotiation closer to your target price. $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, and it's still within your budget.  If Alice rejects this offer, you can use the remaining rounds to further negotiate a price closer to your desired $8,000."
