"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000.

"I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, but I'd like to discuss the terms of the sale. I'm thinking of negotiating a 2-year warranty and a maintenance package that would be included. Would you be open to including these in the sale?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the warranty and maintenance package, Bob. I'm willing to discuss the terms of the sale, but I'm not willing to budge on the price. However, I'm willing to throw in a premium support package that includes priority access to our technical team, regular software updates, and dedicated customer service. This package would normally cost $200000, but I'm willing to include it for free if you're willing to meet me at a price of $1600000.
