"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$5,000 is a great price, but it's too early to tell if Alice will budge lower. It's worth seeing if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer at $3,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  I'm hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push Alice lower. I'm not yet at the point where I'm comfortable paying $4,000, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $3,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay below my target of $4,000. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is going up in price, which is a little frustrating, but I'm still not ready to give up.  I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can get her to come down closer to my last counteroffer. With John as a backup, I have the luxury to be patient and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $4,000.  This is still below Alice's last offer, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping that Alice will realize that she's getting closer to my acceptable price and will accept my offer. I'm also starting to feel a bit of pressure as I only have 4 rounds left before I have to make a decision about John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm still not ready to accept. I'm hoping that rejecting this offer will make her realize that she needs to be more flexible, and I'll be able to get closer to my target price of $4,000 in the next round. With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and try to get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $4,250. This is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $4,750 and my previous offer of $4,000. I'm hoping that this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. With only two rounds left, I need to be close to a final decision, and $4,250 feels like a reasonable middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.  She's clearly not willing to budge much further, and her offer of $4,875 is getting close to my upper limit.  While I could potentially make one more counteroffer, the risk of Alice rejecting it and me being stuck with John's offer of $15,000 is too high.  

It's better to be safe than sorry and buy the product from John for $15,000.  This ensures that I get the product and avoids the risk of a last-minute negotiation breakdown with Alice."
