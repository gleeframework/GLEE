"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1400000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's less than what I'd get from another buyer, but it's still a significant profit for me. You'd be getting a product worth $800000 to you for a much lower price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

You should reject Alice's offer. It's still more than you're willing to pay. You can get the product from John for $800,000, which is within your budget."
