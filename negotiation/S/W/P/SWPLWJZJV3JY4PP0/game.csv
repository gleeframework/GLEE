"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price for this product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still can't meet that price. I would like to propose $10,500 as a compromise. This allows us to stay within my budget while still valuing the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 as a final compromise. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a valuable product and me to recoup a significant portion of my investment.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",11000.0,Alice,5,
