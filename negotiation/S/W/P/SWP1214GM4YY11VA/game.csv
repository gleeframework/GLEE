"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $800,000 for it. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is far below its true value and what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go lower than $1,200,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I still feel that $800,000 is the maximum I can afford. I propose we meet somewhere in the middle. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to my target price to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
