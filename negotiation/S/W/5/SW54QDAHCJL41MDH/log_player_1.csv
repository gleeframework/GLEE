"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$11,000 is still too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500.  This is another compromise, and it's getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will convince him to close the deal, as we are both getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value. It's a good sign that he's willing to compromise, but I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round.  The risk of missing out on a higher price from John is still a concern."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a slight increase from my last offer and closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value. With only a few rounds left, I need to decide if I'm willing to settle for a lower price or risk losing a potential sale to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  The risk of missing out on a higher price from John is too great at this point.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
