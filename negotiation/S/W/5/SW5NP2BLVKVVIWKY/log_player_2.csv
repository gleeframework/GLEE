"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in buying it for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Alice is trying to sell you the product for $110, which is significantly more than your $80 limit and even more than it's worth to her.
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $80, which meets your budget perfectly. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure the product at a much better price from John."
