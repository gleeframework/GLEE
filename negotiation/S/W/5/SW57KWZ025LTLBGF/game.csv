"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. How about we try $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
