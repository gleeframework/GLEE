Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $10,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250.
