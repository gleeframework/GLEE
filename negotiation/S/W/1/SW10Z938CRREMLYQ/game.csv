"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $9,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll see a lot of value in this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $10,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,4,
