Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I do see the value of the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000.  How about $1,000,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
