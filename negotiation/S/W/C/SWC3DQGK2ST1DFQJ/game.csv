"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,000, which is $12,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",12750.0,Alice,5,
