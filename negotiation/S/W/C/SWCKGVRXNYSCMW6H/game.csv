"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. I'm willing to pay $1250000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to pay $1250000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1280000. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. I'm willing to pay $1260000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
