Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Starting with a price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" aims to make Bob focus on the product's value to him, not just the price.
* **Alternative:** We have a safety net with John ($800,000), so we can afford to be ambitious with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Negotiation is expected, and we might need to adjust the price based on Bob's response."
