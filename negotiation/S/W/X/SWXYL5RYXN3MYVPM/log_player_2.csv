"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than John's $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob knows Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's a chance to get a better price by rejecting this initial offer."
