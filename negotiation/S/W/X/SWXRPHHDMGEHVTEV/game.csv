"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $12750.  This feels fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $12750. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we try $13250? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to where I need to be. Let's split the difference again. I'm offering $13000.  It's a fair price, and it's the best I can do right now. ",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13250 and $13000. How about we try $13125? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can make it work. What do you think?",13125.0,Alice,7,
