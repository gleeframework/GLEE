Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value and uses a phrase like ""fair price"" to make the offer seem reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $20,000, the tone leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate if he finds the price slightly high.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but doesn't guarantee Bob will accept. There's always a chance he'll reject the offer, and you'll sell it to John for $15,000.
* Observe Bob's reaction if possible. If he seems hesitant but interested, you might be able to negotiate a price slightly lower than $20,000 and still make a good profit."
