"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is more than John's offer, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I wanted to get closer to $1,050,000, $1,025,000 is a good price and a decent compromise. This is a better deal than selling to John, so I'm going to accept and close the deal."
