,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
