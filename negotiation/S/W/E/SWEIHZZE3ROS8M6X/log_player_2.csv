"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* This means you save $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though you could potentially haggle with Alice further, accepting her offer is the most financially beneficial option in this scenario."
