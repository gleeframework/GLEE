,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our discussion, $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $10500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still below my minimum value. I'm willing to make one final compromise - I'll accept $11500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and our ongoing discussions. If this doesn't work, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
