Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!
