"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer yet. I'll try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,000.  Let's try $10,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to still make a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $10,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm going to stick to my minimum price for now and see if Bob is willing to budge. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $10,750 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. This would give us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,875.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not quite there. I want to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $11,062.50?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11062.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost there! Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $10,968.75. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. I'm confident we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,968.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,968.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob isn't moving fast enough.  I'm concerned that I'm running out of rounds and may not be able to achieve my desired price.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John willing to pay my minimum, it's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure deal."
