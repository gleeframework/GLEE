It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $1,500,000, as your maximum budget is $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation."

This is a significant counteroffer, aiming to start the negotiation at a lower price point.  Alice is likely to reject this offer, but it will give you a starting point for further negotiation."

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it is still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can get closer to my target."

This counteroffer is a step closer to Alice's price but still below my maximum budget. Hopefully, this will lead to a successful negotiation."
