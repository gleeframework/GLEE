# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as the product is worth the same amount to you.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset.  Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since you are looking to save money, and Alice's offer is the same as what John is offering, you can reject her offer.  You will still get the product from John for the same price."
