Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident the product is worth it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees the best price."
