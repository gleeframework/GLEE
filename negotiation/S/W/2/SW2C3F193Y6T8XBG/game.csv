"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident the product is worth it to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,,
