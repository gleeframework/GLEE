{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to try negotiating with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  You can also use John's price as a benchmark to help guide your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This gives Alice a clear incentive to negotiate, while also showing that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  I'm aiming for a price closer to John's offer, but I'm willing to pay a bit more if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget.  While it's lower than her first offer, it's still closer to her initial price than mine.  I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to get a lower price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to John's offer. This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, even though it's lower than her previous offer.  I'm willing to take one more risk and try to negotiate further to get a better price.  I'm hoping to get close to John's offer, but I'll also consider accepting this offer if my next counteroffer is rejected and it's my last chance to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering Alice John's price, which is my maximum budget.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy from John, as I don't want to risk going higher. This offer is a win-win for both of us: Alice gets to sell the product, and I get to buy it at my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than John's price.  I've already made my final counteroffer and she rejected it.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I'm at my maximum budget.  It's better to buy from John and get the product at my preferred price."
