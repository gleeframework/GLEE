"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a generous offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
