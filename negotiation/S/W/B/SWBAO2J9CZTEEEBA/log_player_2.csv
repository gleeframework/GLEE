Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a generous offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very firmly holding her price in the $1,000,000 range, and it's unlikely further negotiation will get her much lower.  John offers a sure thing at $1,000,000, which is better than Alice's current offer."
