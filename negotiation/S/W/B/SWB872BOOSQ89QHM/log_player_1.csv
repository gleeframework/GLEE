I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired range. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between Bob's offer and my initial asking price, showing flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 less than my previous counteroffer. While I could keep negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a better price. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids potentially prolonging the negotiation."
