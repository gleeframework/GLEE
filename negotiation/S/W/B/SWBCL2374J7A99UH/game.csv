"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  While I understand the value of the product, $950,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $800,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects its true worth.",800000.0,Bob,4,
