"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I understand you value the product at that price, so I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 feels like a good compromise to me.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at that point.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, but I think I can do better than that. I'm counteroffering at $12,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",12250.0,Alice,5,
