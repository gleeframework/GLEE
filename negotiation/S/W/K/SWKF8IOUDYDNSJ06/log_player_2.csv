"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $12,000. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your understanding, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is still a better price than John's, Bob can likely still get a better deal. Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Bob is within his target price range.  He should counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to his ideal price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, but I think I can do better than that. I'm counteroffering at $12,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer and she's not willing to go lower. While Bob could technically continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice will walk away and he'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  $12,250 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's well within his budget and significantly lower than John's price. Accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures Bob gets the product at a fair price."
