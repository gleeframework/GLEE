Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,120,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional features and support. I think it's worth considering, especially given the potential benefits the product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she's not willing to go below $1,120,000.  This is still above Bob's budget, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Buying from John guarantees Bob a deal within his budget."
