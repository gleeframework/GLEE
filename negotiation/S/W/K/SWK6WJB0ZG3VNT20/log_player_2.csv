Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for that low. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is the highest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $80. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which meets my budget. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
