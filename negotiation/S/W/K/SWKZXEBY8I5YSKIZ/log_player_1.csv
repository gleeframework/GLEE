"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,100,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, but I'd like to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still early in the negotiation, and Bob is clearly willing to move closer to our desired price. Accepting $1,075,000 would be leaving money on the table. We can likely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,090,000?"",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a price Bob is willing to pay, but we still have room to negotiate. By making a smaller concession this round, we signal we're serious but also willing to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'd like to meet you halfway again. How about we try $1,080,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently moving towards our price point, even if it's in smaller increments.  $1,080,000 is a solid profit above our minimum and there's a risk Bob will walk away if we push too hard. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a worse offer later or losing the deal altogether."
