"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $650,000 for it.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the minimum I'm willing to accept.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a number that works for me, but $900,000 is still a bit high. How about we settle at $725,000? ",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $725,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close! I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? It's a fair offer that allows me to get a good deal while still recognizing the value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're very close, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
