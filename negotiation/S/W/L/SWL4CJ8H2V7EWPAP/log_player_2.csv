{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a fallback option to buy from John for $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately. It's always advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your last counteroffer. It's likely that you're getting close to her bottom line.  Accepting this offer secures a price that's significantly lower than what you could have gotten from John,  saving you a considerable amount of money.  With only three rounds left, it's not worth risking a further negotiation that might not lead to a better deal."
