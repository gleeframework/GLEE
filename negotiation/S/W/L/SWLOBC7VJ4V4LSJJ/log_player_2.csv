"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high. There's room to negotiate a better price. It's too early to buy from John at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming low:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $120 limit.
* **Polite and reasonable:** The message is framed positively, expressing interest while clearly stating our budget constraints. This helps maintain a good negotiating environment.
* **Leaving room for Alice:** A counteroffer of $70 allows Alice to counter back, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $85? It's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice moved closer to her value, but we're still a significant amount away from our target. Rejecting keeps the negotiation going.
* **Alternative exists:** We have John's offer of $120 as a backup, so we're not desperate to accept $85.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 10 rounds, we don't want to concede too quickly.  There's time for a few more counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $78?  That's a good compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's last offer ($85) and our previous offer ($70). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise. 
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:** By moving up slightly, we see if Alice is truly willing to negotiate or if she's stuck on a price closer to $85.
* **Maintaining a good pace:** We're making steady progress without conceding too much ground too quickly."
