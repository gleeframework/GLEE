"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  To make this work, I can go as low as $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
