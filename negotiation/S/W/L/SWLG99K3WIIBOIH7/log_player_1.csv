"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would still be a good return for you, and a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. This price still allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This will allow you to achieve a decent return while I acquire a valuable product at a price I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $950,000. I believe the product is worth that much, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to settle at $925,000. This compromise would allow you to secure a valuable asset at a reasonable price, while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
