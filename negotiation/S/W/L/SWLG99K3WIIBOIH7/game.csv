"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while I can still secure a significant return on my investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would still be a good return for you, and a fair price for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. This price still allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This will allow you to achieve a decent return while I acquire a valuable product at a price I can afford.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to settle at $925,000. This compromise would allow you to secure a valuable asset at a reasonable price, while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
