``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, making it appealing to Bob. However, it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price closer to my target.  I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,200 is tempting, I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum value of $12,000. I'll counteroffer one last time, and if Bob rejects, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $9,300?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,300. How about $9,150? It's my final offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's final offer is still too low for me. I'm not willing to compromise any further, and I'm confident I can get a better price from John.  I'll take the $12,000 and move on."
