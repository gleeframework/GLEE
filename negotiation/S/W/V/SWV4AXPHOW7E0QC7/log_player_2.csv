Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

While $16,000 is better than $18,000, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll stick with my original plan and buy from John for $12,000."
