"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** We want to anchor the negotiation high, significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" we provide a vague but plausible reason for the high initial price.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  It's important to appear willing to negotiate, even with a strong opening offer. This encourages Bob to counter and engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his counter was expected, accepting $600,000 would be a substantial loss.  It's time to steer the negotiation closer to your target range. We'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This takes into account its true market value and the benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reject:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly state it's too low. 
* **Significant Reduction (but above target):** We drop the price by $400,000, showing movement but staying well above both your minimum and his initial offer.  This keeps the door open for further negotiation.
* **Reiterate Value:** We re-emphasize the product's value, aiming to justify the higher price point in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that considers both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving in the right direction, but $750,000 is still substantially below your $1,500,000 minimum. You have the security of John's offer and some room for negotiation left. It's worth seeing if you can bring Bob closer to your target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a collaborative and understanding tone, acknowledging Bob's effort.
* **Significant Concession (but above minimum):** This counteroffer is a $300,000 reduction, a substantial move designed to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate. Importantly, we remain above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Emphasize ""Deal"" and ""Value"":** The message highlights the goal of reaching a deal while subtly reminding Bob of the product's inherent value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle - I'm willing to go up to $900,000 if that works for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, he's still significantly below your minimum of $1,500,000.  His increments are small, and he seems fixated on a price point far below the product's value to you. 

At this stage, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the deal with John."
