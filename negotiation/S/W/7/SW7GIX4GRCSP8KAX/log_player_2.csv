"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is at Bob's maximum budget, so it's not beneficial for him. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is halfway between his maximum budget and Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might further increase the price or reject future counteroffers. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
