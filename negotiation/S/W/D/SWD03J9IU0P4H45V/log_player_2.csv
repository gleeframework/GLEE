"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $10,500 is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $15,000. It gives her some room to negotiate while still making a profit.
* **Strategic Move:**  Bob is trying to get the price down to a point that's just above John's price,  to incentivize Alice to accept while still saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10500 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11250?  This would allow us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $11,250 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than Alice's initial offer and significantly less than what John is offering.
* **Negotiation Exhausted:** Alice has already moved closer to Bob's offer, so further counteroffers are unlikely to yield much more savings.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, it's possible that Alice will walk away from the deal. Bob might have to settle with John for the higher price.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob gets a good price while minimizing the risk of losing out on the product."
