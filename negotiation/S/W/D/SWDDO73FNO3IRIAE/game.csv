"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
