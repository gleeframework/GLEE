Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Reasoning:

* **Good Deal:**  Alice is firm at $825,000. This is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has risks. Alice might not budge further, and you'd lose out on this price. Even if she does, the potential savings might not be worth the risk of her walking away. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** You've both made concessions, and this price feels like a fair compromise."
