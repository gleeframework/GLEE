"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,3,
