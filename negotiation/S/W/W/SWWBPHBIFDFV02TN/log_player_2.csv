"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer of $20,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
