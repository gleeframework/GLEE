Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially lets me secure a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives me leverage. I don't *need* to sell to Bob, so I can be bolder.
* **Psychology:**  A strong opening offer can signal confidence in the product's value. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have some flexibility to negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer."
