"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I am offering it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the maximum he's willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain a fair price for my product. Therefore, I propose a price of $10,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still lower than Bob's maximum of $15,000, and it's a reasonable compromise.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John. While Bob could try for a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower, and the risk of further negotiation could lead to a longer process or even the deal falling through."
