{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not too high to deter him from negotiating. We'll see if he's willing to play ball!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still allows me to make a good profit, and it's a fair offer for the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, it's getting close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing more money by continuing. John is a safe bet at this point, as he's willing to pay my minimum price."
