"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be very valuable for you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering me. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the absolute minimum price I'm willing to accept. There's no room for negotiation upwards from there.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to potentially waste time negotiating with Bob and risk getting a worse outcome."
