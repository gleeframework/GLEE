"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $97.50. Can you consider this price?",97.5,Bob,4,
