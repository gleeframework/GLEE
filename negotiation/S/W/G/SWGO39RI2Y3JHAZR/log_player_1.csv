Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $10,000 is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:** Highlighting the value proposition for Bob and framing it as a ""great deal"" encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message doesn't close the door on negotiation, allowing Bob to counter if he feels the price is too high.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can use John's offer of $12,000 as a benchmark for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob is on a tight budget, his offer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  There's potential to find a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, giving me leverage during the negotiation with Bob.  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't risk losing out on a sale altogether.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $8,500 but lower than $10,000, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I can come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the offer as a good deal, even at a higher price.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I phrase the message to leave room for further negotiation, indicating willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Plan B:** I still have John's offer of $12,000 as a fallback if Bob is unwilling to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $9,250 is close to my minimum desired price of $12,000. While it's not ideal, it's a significant improvement over Bob's initial offer of $8,500.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Further negotiation could be time-consuming and might not yield a substantially better price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  There's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely if I reject his offer again.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of selling to John, which could be delayed or fall through. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision. It allows me to secure a sale at a price that's close to my minimum value, minimizing potential losses and reducing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
