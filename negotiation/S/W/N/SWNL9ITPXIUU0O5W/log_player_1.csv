Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,450,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and potential, while also being mindful of my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $1,250,000 or lower. I believe this is a reasonable price that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

``` 

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to budge past $1,250,000. Accepting this offer nets me a $50,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer. It's not worth risking losing the deal entirely for a relatively small potential gain at this point."
