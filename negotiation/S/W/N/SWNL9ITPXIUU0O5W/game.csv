"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This price reflects the true value and the return on investment you can expect.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,450,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and potential, while also being mindful of my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,380,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1380000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $1,250,000 or lower. I believe this is a reasonable price that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
