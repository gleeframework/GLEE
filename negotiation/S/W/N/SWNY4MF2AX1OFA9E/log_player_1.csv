{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. It's likely Bob will find this price attractive since it's still below his perceived value. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on John's offer."
