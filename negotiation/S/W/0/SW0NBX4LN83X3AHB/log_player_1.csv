Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving room for a deal:**  There's still $500 of potential profit for Bob, making the offer attractive. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on the price he proposes.
* If the negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I'll cut my losses and sell the product to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:**  Selling to John immediately would secure a profit, but I'm hoping to maximize my earnings.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, attempting to find a compromise between his offer and my desired price. 
* I'll be mindful of the risk of losing the deal entirely if my counteroffer is too high or if Bob is unwilling to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which I believe is fair considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle on this one!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly hinting that $9,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation open and avoid an impasse.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his response carefully and potentially adjust my counteroffer further.
* If the negotiations stall or become too time-consuming, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to go above $8,500. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unclear if Bob is willing to move further. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that continued negotiation will drag on and I may not be able to secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

*  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $10,000, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's current offer. 
* This decision minimizes the risk of getting stuck in a protracted negotiation that may not result in a favorable outcome."
