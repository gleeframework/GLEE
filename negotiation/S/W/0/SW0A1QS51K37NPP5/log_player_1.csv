"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving some room for Bob to feel like he got a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is a decent profit, I'm not satisfied with it yet.  I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $135, which is still a good profit for me, but is closer to Bob's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility and signals my willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my target. I'm willing to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  It's a good profit margin, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for the lower price from John."
