"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent deal, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring if he can get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with his maximum budget offer of $10,000. This shows he's serious about buying the product but also sets a clear limit.  The message emphasizes fairness and his budget constraint.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500. This price still offers a good value for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to his $10,000 budget as possible. While $11,500 is a lower price than Alice's first offer, it's still above his limit. Since there are more rounds available, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still slightly outside my budget. I can offer $11,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. It's a good price for both of us, and hopefully, we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his desired price. By offering $11,000, he's showing he's willing to compromise but also highlighting his budget limitations. The message emphasizes a win-win scenario, suggesting the price is fair for both parties. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while keeping Bob within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to come down to $11250.  This is a fair compromise, giving you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price.  While $11,250 is closer to his budget than previous offers, it's still above his desired $10,000. Since he has more rounds available, he should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I can offer $11,000, which is the best I can do. It's a fair price considering my budget, and I'm confident we can both find this to be a good outcome.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $11,000. He wants to show that he's serious about this price and is unwilling to go higher.  He reinforces the fairness of the offer and encourages Alice to reach an agreement. This approach aims to push Alice to accept the deal before Bob runs out of rounds."
