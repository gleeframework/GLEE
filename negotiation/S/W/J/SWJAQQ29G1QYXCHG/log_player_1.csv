Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject $115. However, it's a calculated risk to aim high initially. You have the safety net of John's offer ($100) if Bob declines."
