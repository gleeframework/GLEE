Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows for some potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at this price point ensures a substantial profit above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John gives us a strong fallback position. We don't need to be desperate in our negotiation with Bob."
