"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a bit far off from that price point.  How about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
