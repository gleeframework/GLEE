"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it still represents a great value for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That's my absolute minimum, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
