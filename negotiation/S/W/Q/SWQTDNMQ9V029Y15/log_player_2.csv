Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $7,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,500. It's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

It's clear Alice is stuck around a $9,000-$9,500 price point.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get her much lower, and it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000 which meets your needs."
