"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite high. This item would be valuable to me, but I need a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $7,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,500. It's the best I can do at this point.",9500.0,Alice,5,
