Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly closer to my valuation, but I still have room to negotiate. I'm not willing to accept a price that low this early in the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming a bit higher. Would you consider $1,650,000? This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and recognizes the value you see in the product."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $1,550,000 is tempting, I believe I can still push for a higher price. Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my desired range. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to $1,600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair deal considering the product's unique value."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,580,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'd like to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge past this point, and it's a strong offer. Accepting $1,580,000 is a significant profit, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether.  It's time to close the deal."
