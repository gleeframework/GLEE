"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and go with $80.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'll be happy to take it off your hands.",80.0,Bob,4,
