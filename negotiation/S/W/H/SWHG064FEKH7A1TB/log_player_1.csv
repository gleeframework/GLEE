"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a quick win, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This price would still allow you to make a good profit, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. I believe this price is fair to both of us and could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to settle for anything less than $9,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still too far from what I need to get for this product. Let's meet at $9,000. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to come out ahead."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm sticking to my guns and making a final counteroffer at $9,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's most recent offer. I'm hoping he'll see the value in this price and we can finally reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I have to say that I'm getting a bit concerned about the price and I'm starting to consider buying from a competitor. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is showing signs of wavering, and although he's coming back with a price that's only slightly higher than his first offer, it's clear he's not going to budge much further.  I'm not willing to risk losing even more time and potentially ending up with a price I'm not happy with.  I'm going to take John's offer and sell the product for $12,000."
