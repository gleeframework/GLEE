"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $120 for this exceptional item? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still above my maximum budget of $80.  It's worth exploring if I can get a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be happy to pay $85, which is a fair price considering my needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a strong opening move that signals my serious interest while setting a clear boundary on my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering our previous discussion, how about we meet in the middle at $97.50? This respects both the value I place on the product and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $97.50 is still above my budget. While she's shown a willingness to negotiate, I believe I can still push for a lower price.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $97.50 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm happy to pay $90.  This price reflects the value of the product for me and allows for a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my strategy of gradually increasing my offer while keeping it below my maximum budget of $80.  $90 represents a significant compromise for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a price closer to $100. How about $95? This respects the value of the product while making it more accessible for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still above my budget. While we're getting closer, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement within the 10 rounds. To avoid the risk of losing out on the deal entirely, I'm going to buy the product from John for $80. This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, even if it means missing out on a potential lower price from Alice."
