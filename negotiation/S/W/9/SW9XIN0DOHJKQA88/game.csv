"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get you started. I'm offering it to you for $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to come down to $900000, but that's as low as I can go. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. Can you consider that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I still think the product is worth more than $875000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm going to counter with $920000. That's my final offer for now.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $920000. I'm willing to go up to $890000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $920000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $20000, so the total value you'll be getting is $940000. That's my final offer.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $905000. Can you consider that?",905000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm going to counter with $915000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",915000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your last offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $915000. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other options. I appreciate your time and effort, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere.",0.0,Bob,10,
