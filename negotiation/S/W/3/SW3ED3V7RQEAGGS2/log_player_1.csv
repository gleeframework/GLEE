"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a great deal for me, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a great price for you. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still above my minimum of $800,000.  While I would ideally like a higher price, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and prevents me from potentially needing to sell to John at a lower price."
