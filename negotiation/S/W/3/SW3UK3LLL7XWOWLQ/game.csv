"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm interested but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than that. How about we start at $1,050,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us and would allow me to make this purchase work within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really close to accepting, but I need to see that $1,100,000 price. It's a fair deal for both of us and will allow me to move forward with the purchase. I'm hoping you can see my perspective and agree to this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,125,000. I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which will add significant value to the product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000, and I'm confident this is a fair and competitive offer. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,7,
