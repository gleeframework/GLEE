Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its value to him.
    * I make $100,000 more than John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting other interested parties encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value."
