Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $10,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
