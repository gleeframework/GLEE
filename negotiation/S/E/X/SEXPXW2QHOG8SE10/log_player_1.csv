Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob is clearly trying to drive the price down too low.  At this point, I'm concerned I'm not going to get a good deal with him, and I'm running out of rounds. It's best to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,000,000.  This will ensure I get at least my minimum desired price."
