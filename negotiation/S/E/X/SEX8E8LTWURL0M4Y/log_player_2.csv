"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is already above her value for the product. This leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates your willingness to compromise while maintaining a favorable price point for yourself.  Since Alice values the product at $80, there's a good chance she'll find this counteroffer attractive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110.  This is a good deal for you, as it's well within your budget and significantly lower than John's price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for you at a favorable price."
