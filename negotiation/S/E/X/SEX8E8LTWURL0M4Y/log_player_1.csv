Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. It also reflects the value of the product to Bob, giving him a potential benefit for buying from you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is more than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, and you have room to negotiate higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, showing that you're willing to negotiate, but it's also lower than your initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. This approach aims to find a middle ground and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
