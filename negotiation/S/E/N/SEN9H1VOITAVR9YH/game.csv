"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for someone like you who understands its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'm offering $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant investment but allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's not miss this opportunity.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a successful transaction. Let's work together to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Considering the value of this product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain, and it's a reasonable compromise for me.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
