Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'm offering $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant investment but allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's not miss this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a successful transaction. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Considering the value of this product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain, and it's a reasonable compromise for me.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I have time to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
