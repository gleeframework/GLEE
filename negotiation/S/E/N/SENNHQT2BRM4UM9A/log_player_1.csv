Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something you value highly."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You have valuable information â€“ Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives you significant bargaining power.
* **Targeting the High End:**  Starting with a strong offer of $12,000 aims to capture a large portion of the value difference ($15,000 - $8,000 = $7,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is strong, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $11,000) and for you to still come out ahead of your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything. You can proceed with selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
