Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat?  I'd be willing to let it go for $1,700,000."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate you moving a bit, but $1,700,000 is still more than double what I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, anything over $800,000 and I might as well explore other options. How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to budge much above $800,000 and I have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000.  It's time to move on to John."
