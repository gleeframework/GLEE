"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat?  I'd be willing to let it go for $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate you moving a bit, but $1,700,000 is still more than double what I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, anything over $800,000 and I might as well explore other options. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
