"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. Considering the product's value and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $2000000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
