"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $13,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at that price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $15,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
