"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and meet at $7,750?  I think that's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,750 is still too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,125?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal.  What do you say?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $7,900.  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",7900.0,Bob,6,
