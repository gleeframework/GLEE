Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with selling it for that amount. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,750 is still too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,125?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8125}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $7,900.  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I would like to get more from Bob, I've been negotiating for a while now and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement.  It's important to remember that time is money, and I can't afford to waste too much time haggling with Bob.  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay a fair price, so it makes sense to go with him."
