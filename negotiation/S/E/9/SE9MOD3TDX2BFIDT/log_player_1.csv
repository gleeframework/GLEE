Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, knowing the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $10,000 is a good starting point because it leaves enough room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. 
* **John as a safety net:** I have John's offer of $8,000 as a fallback, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $8,000.  

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $7,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, so I'm not giving away the product for too cheap. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and how flexible he is on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's not ideal, there's still a chance I could get a slightly better price if I reject his offer. However, the risk is that Bob might walk away completely. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a profit. It's better to secure a good deal than to risk losing the sale altogether.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $8,500. It's a good deal for me, and it minimizes the risk of losing the sale."
