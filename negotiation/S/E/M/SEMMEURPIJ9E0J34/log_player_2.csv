"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $150 is above your maximum budget of $120.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to try and get Alice to come down from her initial price. $100 is a substantial reduction, making it clear I'm serious about negotiating. This allows room for potential compromise throughout the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $125 is still above my maximum budget of $120.  I'm going to continue to negotiate, aiming to get the price down further.  There's still room for a counteroffer before I have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $125 is still just a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $115. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'd get a lot of enjoyment out of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my goal of saving as much money as possible.  $115 is a good compromise,  leaving room for Alice to accept and still get a decent price.  I'm also reiterating my interest in the product to make her more inclined to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $125 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm now offering the product to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally met my maximum budget of $120.  This is the best possible price for me, considering I have the option to buy from John at the same price.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the purchase."
