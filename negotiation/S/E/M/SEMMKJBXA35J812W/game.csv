"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a fair agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $925,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll recognize the value of this deal. If you decline this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John instead.
