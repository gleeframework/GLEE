This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. This price is attractive to Bob, as it's below his perceived value.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price through another counteroffer. I'm starting to feel like John might be a better option at this point, but I'll give Bob one more chance."

I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $925,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll recognize the value of this deal. If you decline this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John instead. "", ""product_price"": 925000}
