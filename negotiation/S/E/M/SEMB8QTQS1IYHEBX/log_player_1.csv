Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob has made his final offer, and it's still below my desired value. We've been negotiating for a while, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will lead to a better outcome.  To avoid the risk of not reaching a deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
