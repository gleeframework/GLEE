Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product and the initial offer. While I agree that it holds potential value, the proposed price of $2,300,000 is significantly above what I'm currently prepared to spend. I would be willing to consider purchasing the product for $1,100,000. I believe this offer reflects my genuine interest while recognizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,900,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product while acknowledging the need for a price that makes sense for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
