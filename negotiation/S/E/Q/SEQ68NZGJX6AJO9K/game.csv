"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I believe this price would be fair for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,750. However, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you consider $10,600? It's a small difference, but it would make a big impact for my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10600.0,Bob,4,
