Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is above Bob's valuation but below your minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially earn more than from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum valuation. I'll try to get closer to my goal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $92 is still below my minimum valuation, it's a good compromise.  I'd rather sell to Bob and avoid the risk of losing the sale to John."
