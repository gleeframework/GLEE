"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. While I would like to accommodate you, the current offer of $750,000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $850,000 for the product?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to adjust our price slightly. My counteroffer is $840,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",840000.0,Alice,5,
