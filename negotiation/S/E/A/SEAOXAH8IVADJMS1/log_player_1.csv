{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great addition to your business. My initial price is $2,000,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  While $2,000,000 is well above Bob's estimated value, it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making it clear that it's worth investing in. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy is intended to:

* **Test the Waters:**  See if Bob is willing to engage at a high price. 
* **Set a Strong Baseline:** Establishing a high starting price gives me more room to negotiate down.
* **Maintain Control:** By offering a high price, I'm in a position of power and can dictate the pace of the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the potential value it brings to my business. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not desperate for a deal and maintains my leverage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm:

* **Setting a Firm Boundary:**  Demonstrating that I have a minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
* **Encouraging Further Negotiation:**  Giving Bob an opportunity to revise his offer and potentially reach a more mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Keeping My Options Open:**  If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
