"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the potential value it brings to my business. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below what I need to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which reflects the true value of the product and provides some room for compromise. I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to gain something from this transaction.  Let's work together to finalize a deal!",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident that this product is a great investment for me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,250,000. This shows a significant commitment from my side and provides an opportunity for both of us to make a good deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000, which reflects a compromise on my part.  This price is fair and gives us both an opportunity to achieve our goals. Let's find common ground and make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  $1,600,000 is still higher than my budget, but I'm getting closer to a deal I can accept. I'm offering $1,400,000, which is a significant commitment from my side and a fair reflection of the value this product brings to my business.  Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us!",1400000.0,Bob,6,
