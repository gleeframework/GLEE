"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $140.  You can get it for $150 from John, so there's room for negotiation to get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her value of $120, giving her some incentive to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still higher than the price you're willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."

You've already shown Alice you're serious about getting a better price.  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous one, suggesting you're willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

Alice's offer is now higher than what John is selling the product for. Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to buy the product from John at $150."
