Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  I'll be closely watching his response to gauge how motivated he is to buy."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a bit more.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm going to counter with $12,500.  This is a compromise that's still above my minimum, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more.  While Bob has come up a little, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and we're nearing the end of our rounds. I don't want to risk losing out on a deal altogether. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
