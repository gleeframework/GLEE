"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference at $12,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
