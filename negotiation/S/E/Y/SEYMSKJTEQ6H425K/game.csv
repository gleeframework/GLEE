"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that figure?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $13,000 is still out of reach. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that's the best we can do. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that's the best we can do. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,750. It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our target. Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $10,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,9,
