"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's a good starting point for negotiation but far from acceptable. Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that figure?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue negotiating and aim for a price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $13,000 is still out of reach. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that's the best we can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's getting closer, Bob should try to push for a lower price. He has 5 rounds left, and the option of buying from John for $8,000, so he has leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that's the best we can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $2,500 higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob has 3 rounds left and can still buy from John for $8,000.  There's room for further negotiation.  He should try to push for a price closer to $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,750.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $10,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still $2,250 more than Bob is willing to pay.  This leaves only one round left.  Given the limited time and the risk of Alice not accepting a counteroffer, the best course of action for Bob is to buy the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees Bob the product at the best possible price within his budget."
