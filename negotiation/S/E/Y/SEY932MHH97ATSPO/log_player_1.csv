I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $1,200,000."
