Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves him with a potential ""deal"" if he values it higher or sees future benefits.
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages dialogue, giving me insight into Bob's position and potential for negotiation."
