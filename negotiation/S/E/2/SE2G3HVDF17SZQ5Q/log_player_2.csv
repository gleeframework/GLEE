"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and Alice's own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $150 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a positive negotiation experience.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial counter-offer will help gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand it's a bit of a difference from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down significantly, the price is still above your maximum and her valuation.  There's room for Alice to go lower. You could try countering closer to $100, or consider if you want to walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  We're incrementally increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good deal.
* **Staying Below Max:**  It's important to remain below your $100 maximum.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  Continuing the conversation with a respectful and appreciative tone encourages continued negotiation."
