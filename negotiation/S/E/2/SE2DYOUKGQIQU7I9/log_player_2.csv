"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
