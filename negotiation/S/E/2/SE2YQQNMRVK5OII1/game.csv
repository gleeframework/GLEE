,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $200 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $150? It's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $175? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to do $160? It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $165? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",165.0,Alice,5,
