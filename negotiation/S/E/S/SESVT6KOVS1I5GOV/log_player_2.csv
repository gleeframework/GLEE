"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're proposing a special introductory price of $100 for you. Considering its worth to you is $120, this offer represents a great opportunity to acquire it at a slight discount. We hope you find this proposal attractive and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you have an alternative option with John for $120. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further in a subsequent negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you might be able to secure a better deal."
