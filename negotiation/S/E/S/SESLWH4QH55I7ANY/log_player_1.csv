"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to Bob, and it still leaves me with a profit margin higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. It's a compromise that still leaves me with a decent profit margin, while also being closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $125. It's still a decent profit margin, and I'm worried that if I reject this offer, I might not be able to get a better price, and I could risk losing the sale entirely.  It's better to secure a profit than to risk getting nothing."
