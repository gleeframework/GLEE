"I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price is still fair considering the potential benefits you'll gain. I'm open to further discussion if you'd like to explore options.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 again, but I'm also willing to throw in an additional $20000 if you're willing to meet me halfway. Can you consider this revised offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the added incentive. However, $1220000 still falls short of what I consider a fair price for this exceptional product.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $1275000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's finalize this deal and unlock the benefits this product has to offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your efforts. However, at $1250000, we're still not quite there.  This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and its potential benefits far outweigh that price. I'm willing to go down to $1200000, but I need to be sure I'm getting fair value for something this exceptional.  Let's make this happen, Bob.  This is our last chance to secure this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand the product's uniqueness, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1190000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal, and I'm not willing to compromise further. Can you consider this revised offer?",1190000.0,Bob,8,
