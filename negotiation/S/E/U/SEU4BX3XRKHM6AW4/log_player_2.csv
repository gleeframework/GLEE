"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is below your maximum budget, you can likely do better. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price. This might encourage Alice to make a second, lower offer. If she doesn't, you still have the option to buy from John for $15,000."
