Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $12000? I believe this is a fair offer, considering my budget and the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
