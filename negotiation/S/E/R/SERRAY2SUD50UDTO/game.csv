"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for $1,900,000? This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a significant step down from what I believe is a fair valuation.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,625,000.
