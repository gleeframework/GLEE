Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down.  $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  It's a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget and hopefully still gives you a good deal.
