"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on a valuable product at a price that's still beneficial for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
