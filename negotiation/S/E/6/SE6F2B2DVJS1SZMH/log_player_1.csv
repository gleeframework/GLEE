Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I value the product at $12,000, so anything below that is a loss.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so any price above that is a loss for him. 
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves a range of $2,000 for negotiation.
* **First offer:** I'm offering $11,500, which is a good starting point within the negotiation range. It gives Bob room to counter-offer, while still being significantly higher than his minimum.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to:

* **Start the negotiation strong:**  By offering a price closer to my value, I signal that I'm serious about maximizing profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Bob can likely counter-offer, which gives us space to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Knowing that I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000, I can walk away from the deal if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $10,500 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Potential gain:**  I can likely get closer to my target by counter-offering. 
* **John as backup:** Having John as an option for $12,000 provides a safety net if negotiations fail. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Continue negotiations:**  I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Avoid immediate loss:** Selling at $10,500 would be a loss for me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous offer:** Bob offered $10,500, which is still too low for me.
* **Compromise:** I'm willing to lower my price to $11,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer of $11,500.
* **Negotiation space:** This gives Bob some room to counter-offer, while still being significantly higher than his initial offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** By lowering my price, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The price is still higher than Bob's initial offer, giving me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Increase chances of a deal:**  A price of $11,000 might be more attractive to Bob, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
