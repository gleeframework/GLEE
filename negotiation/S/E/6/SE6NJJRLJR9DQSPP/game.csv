"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 is its true value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $16,500? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,500 is still too far from what I had in mind.  To be honest, I can't justify going over $12,000 for the product. If you're willing to work within that range, I think we can make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I can go as low as $14,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that final offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to it.",13000.0,Bob,6,
