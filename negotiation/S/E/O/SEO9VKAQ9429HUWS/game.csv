"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  How about $160? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a profit.",160.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $170. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a decent profit on this sale.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $170 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $165. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",165.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $165. I'll meet you at $167.50, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",167.5,Alice,5,
