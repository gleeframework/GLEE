"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Meeting in the middle at $90 is a good starting point. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer it to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
