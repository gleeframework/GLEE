Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a lower price. It's worth another counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Meeting in the middle at $90 is a good starting point. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer it to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $90, and we're getting close to our maximum budget. Accepting at $92 secures a decent deal without risking the price going up again."
