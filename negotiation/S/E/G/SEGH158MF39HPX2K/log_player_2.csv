"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do much better than $900,000. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for a potential compromise.  It's a reasonable starting point given Alice's likely minimum price is $800,000. This counteroffer shows you are serious about getting a good deal, but are also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still too high.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get a lower price.  It's likely that Alice will be more willing to compromise after my previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing from my previous offer but staying below Alice's current offer.  I'm assuming Alice is likely to accept this offer, as it's closer to her value than my previous offer and still allows her to make a profit. It also shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still not a good deal for me.  At this point, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with Alice might result in a stalemate, and I don't want to waste any more time.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed way to get the product, even if it's not the best price.  I'll need to factor in the additional cost later, but right now, it's the most efficient option."
