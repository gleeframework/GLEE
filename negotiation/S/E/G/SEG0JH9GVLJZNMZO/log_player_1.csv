Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000 (because it's worth that much to me).
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $12,000.
* **John's price:** $15,000.

I'm offering $14,000 to Bob. This is a good compromise: 

* It's higher than Bob's maximum, so he'll need to consider it carefully. 
* It's lower than my minimum, but still a good profit for me.

If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for my desired price. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product at a price lower than John's offer."
