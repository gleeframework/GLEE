"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your maximum price:** You're willing to pay up to $100.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering the product for $90.
* **John's price:** John is selling the same product for $100.

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price and John's price, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $10."
