"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, and Bob might accept outright. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. His response will give you a better sense of how much he values the product and how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low. Accepting $80 would be a significant loss. While his message suggests some room for negotiation, it's unlikely he'll immediately jump to a price acceptable to you.  You'll counteroffer in the next round to steer the negotiation closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly below the product's value. I could be flexible, but I need a price that's fair for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Acknowledging Bob's budget shows you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Significant Drop:** By dropping the price by $60, you demonstrate a willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $140 is still comfortably above your minimum and provides room for further negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Offering to ""meet halfway"" can encourage Bob to act quickly before you consider other options (like selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $120 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** You're still making a profit of $40, which is better than nothing if negotiations stall or break down.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better offer. Accepting now secures the sale. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a chance Bob could walk away entirely. Accepting eliminates that risk. 
 
Overall, $120 is a decent offer given the circumstances."
