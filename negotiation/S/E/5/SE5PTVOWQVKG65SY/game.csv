,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives us both a good deal and allows me to stay closer to my own valuation.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $950,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this gap.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to offer $910,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. It's a significant move from my last offer, and we're getting closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer of $910,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $917,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",917500.0,Alice,7,
