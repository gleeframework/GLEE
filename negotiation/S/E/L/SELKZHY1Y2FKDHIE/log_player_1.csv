Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows for room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's important to be aggressive in the first round to establish a high baseline."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  I've reached my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower. There's a risk Bob might come up to $13,000 in the next round, but I'm too close to the deadline and I'm not sure he's willing to go that high.  I'd rather secure a sale at my minimum and avoid any further risk."
