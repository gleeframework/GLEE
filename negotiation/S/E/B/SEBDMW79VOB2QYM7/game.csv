"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,350,000. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your perspective and willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the potential benefits it holds for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This reflects a fair compromise, recognizing its worth while acknowledging your initial offer.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
