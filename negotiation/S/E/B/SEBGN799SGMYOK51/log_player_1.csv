Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product, which I believe holds immense value.  I'm confident it would be a great asset to your business. My initial price is $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in it, my budget is quite limited. I am willing to pay up to $1400000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, it's still below the minimum value I've set for the product ($1,000,000). I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Selling to John at this point would leave money on the table."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I'm confident this product will bring substantial value to your business, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the market value and potential benefits, I am willing to pay $1425000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I still have a few rounds to go. There's a chance that he might offer a higher price if I hold firm. Selling to John now would mean walking away from potentially earning more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,425,000 is still slightly below what I believe is a fair price for this product. I'm confident this product will bring you significant benefits. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,437,500? Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1437500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience. After careful consideration, I am willing to pay $1430000 for the product. This amount reflects the value I believe it brings to our business while staying within our budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead us to a successful conclusion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,430,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,430,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,430,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,437,500.  We are only $7,500 apart, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by pushing for a higher price. We're in the 6th round, and there's a good chance that Bob won't budge further.  Accepting his offer is the most sensible decision at this point."
