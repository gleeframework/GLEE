""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know its value to you is significant, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."",

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, making it more likely he'll be willing to pay a premium. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000 gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
