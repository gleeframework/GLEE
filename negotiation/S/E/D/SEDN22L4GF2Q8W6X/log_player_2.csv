"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this incredible product, valued at $10,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Tactic:** Alice is using a common sales tactic by inflating the perceived value to you ($10,000) and offering a ""deal.""
* **Your Advantage:** You know John will sell it to you for $10,000, which is already below your maximum price.
* **Potential Savings:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price or stick with John's $10,000 offer."
