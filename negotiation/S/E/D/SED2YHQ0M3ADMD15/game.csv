"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit above my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's right in the middle of our desired prices.",800000.0,Bob,4,
