Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're still a bit off on the price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not willing to sell below $15,000, that's my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so I'll make a new offer of $13,750. Let's meet in the middle and finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a bit more, it's not worth the risk of exceeding your $8,000 budget. John offers a guaranteed price that saves you significant money."
