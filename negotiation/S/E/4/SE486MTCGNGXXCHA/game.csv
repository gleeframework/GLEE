"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  Let's try $900,000. This still gives you a significant savings compared to the true value of this product, and allows me to earn a fair return.",900000.0,Alice,3,
