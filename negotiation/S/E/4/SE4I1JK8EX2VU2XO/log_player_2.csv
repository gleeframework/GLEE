"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $6,500?"", 
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a lower counter-offer aims to bring the negotiation closer to my desired price range faster.
* **Opens room for negotiation:**  While a significant drop from Alice's offer, it leaves space for her to counter and still potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time constraint:** With only 10 rounds, being more direct in my counter-offers can speed up the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $6,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $9,000?  That's a significant discount from my original ask. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $9,000 is still too high. We need to show her we're serious about a lower price point but also willing to negotiate. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** Moving closer to the middle ground demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a deal.
* **Still below the ""walk-away"" price:** $7,500 keeps the offer below the price at which I'd be willing to buy from John.
* **Simple and direct:**  A straightforward counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive hard bargain, Bob! I'm willing to come down slightly more. How about $8,750?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has declared this her ""final offer,"" and it's still above John's price.  While it's close, there's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and further negotiation might be fruitless. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing to avoid potentially overpaying or missing out entirely."
