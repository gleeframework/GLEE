"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm looking to spend a bit less, though. How about $8500? I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $8500. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and $9200 is closer to what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9000? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500, as I mentioned in our first offer. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9300? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",9300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9300 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9100. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's close this deal!",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9100. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9400. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. What do you think?",9400.0,Alice,7,
