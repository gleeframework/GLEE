"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? ",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm offering $10,125. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $10,125 is pushing my budget. How about $9,900, and we have a deal?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting close to my bottom line here. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is a very fair price for both of us, and I don't think I can go any lower. Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,7,
