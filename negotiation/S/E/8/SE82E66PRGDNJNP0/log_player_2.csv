"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You can get a better deal than $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer that's still within a reasonable range. I want to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal considering my goal is to save as much as possible.  It's a better price than I initially proposed, and I've already used a round of counteroffers. There's no guarantee I'll get a lower price, and it's risky to keep negotiating with Alice, as I could end up with a worse deal or run out of rounds.  It's time to accept and secure the product."
