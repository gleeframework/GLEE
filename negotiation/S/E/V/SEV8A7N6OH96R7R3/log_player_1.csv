``` 

This initial offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but not too aggressive. It leaves room for negotiation and signals that you value the product. By mentioning John, I'm subtly implying that I have other options, which can incentivize Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is closer to my desired price point, and I believe further negotiation may not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale that is within a reasonable range of my desired profit margin."
