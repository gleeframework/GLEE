"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 82?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $82 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? That's my absolute limit, but I'm confident this product would be a great addition to your collection.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 80 is your absolute limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already invested a significant amount of time and effort into this product, and I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than 85. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at 82.50?",82.5,Alice,5,
