Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 82?

Round 4

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 80 is your absolute limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already invested a significant amount of time and effort into this product, and I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than 85. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at 82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer of $82.50 is still above my budget.  Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, I'll take that option to ensure I get the best price and avoid further negotiation."
