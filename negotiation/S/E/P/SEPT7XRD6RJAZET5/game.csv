"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I can offer you a slight discount to $15,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is still a great value for the product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
