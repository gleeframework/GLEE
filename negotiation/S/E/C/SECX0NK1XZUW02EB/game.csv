"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $875,000. Can you consider this revised price?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $887,500 is still a bit above my target. I'll try to meet you halfway again. How about we meet at $882,500?",882500.0,Bob,6,
