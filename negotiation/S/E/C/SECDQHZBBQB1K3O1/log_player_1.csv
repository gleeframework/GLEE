"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still within a range where there's potential for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential benefits for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, showing that I'm open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal.** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not yet at a point where selling to John for $150 is the better option. 
* **Strategic rejection.** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. This still gives you a great price on a fantastic product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still remaining above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $140 still represents a good profit for me, and it allows me to continue negotiating without compromising my bottom line.
* **Staying Positive:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $130. Can we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob has moved closer, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean taking a loss.
* **Negotiation room:**  We're getting closer, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. There are more rounds, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Focus on maximizing profit:**  Selling to John at $150 is an option, but I'm motivated to see if I can close the deal with Bob at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $135. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this fantastic product into your hands. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** My counteroffer is only $5 below my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but not giving away too much.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the ""fair"" price for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and nudge him closer to my desired price.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the worth in my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I can do $128, can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Even though we are getting close, $128 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** While I am motivated to maximize profit, I'm also starting to feel the pressure. If I continue to reject offers, I risk Bob becoming frustrated and abandoning the negotiation.
* **Potential for a Better Counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. We've shown a willingness to compromise, and I think I can get a slightly higher offer in the next round.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can go down to $132. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession ($4 less than my last offer) to show flexibility and keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Remaining Firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, $132 is still a good price for me. 
* **Focus on Closing:**  I'm trying to  close the deal with Bob as we're running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $132 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to the final two rounds, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** If I reject his offer, I risk Bob becoming frustrated and abandoning the negotiation altogether.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, securing a guaranteed profit with John is the more prudent decision at this point in the negotiation."
