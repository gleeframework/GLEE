"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I am not able to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this is a price you can consider. Looking forward to your response!",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you, but also allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,650,000. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1,625,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
