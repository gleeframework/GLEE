Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you in the long run.  However, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $1,500,000 sets a high anchor, making the final offer seem more reasonable.  
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob ($1,500,000) aims to justify the high asking price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Presenting the offer as time-sensitive could encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John will purchase the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim for a higher price with Bob.

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale."
