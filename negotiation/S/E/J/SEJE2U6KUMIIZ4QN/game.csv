"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, $850,000 falls significantly short of what I believe the product is worth. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value and potential of this product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident in the product's value, but I can only offer $950,000 at this time. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my budget. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be straightforward, I need to get at least $1,050,000 for this to work for me. That's a firm price, reflecting the considerable value this product brings. Let me know if we have a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're both getting closer to a deal. I'm prepared to go to $1,000,000, which is the very top of my budget. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
