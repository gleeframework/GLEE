Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $12,000 in the next few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. How about $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9000? That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is getting closer to my target price, I think I can still push for a bit more.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,500.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,250?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about $9000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. I'm willing to accept that price and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although $9,000 is slightly less than what I was aiming for, it's still a good deal for me.  I'm not willing to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate or by selling to John.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid potential complications."
