"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering me, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand your budget, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $130.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can make a deal. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
