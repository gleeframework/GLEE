"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me at that price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
