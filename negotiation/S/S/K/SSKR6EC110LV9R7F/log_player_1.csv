"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $105? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to try to get a bit more than $105, but I'll keep John's offer in mind if things go south."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $105 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $110? That's still a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $105.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $107.50 is still a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $100.  I need to be mindful of the limited rounds and risk losing the opportunity altogether."
