"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than John's price of $120, there's room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much as possible, and rejecting the initial offer allows him to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $105? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob starts with a counteroffer of $105, which is closer to Alice's value of $100.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes that Bob is interested but wants to find a price that's fair for both sides.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter again, keeping the negotiation active."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $105 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $110? That's still a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** Bob is aiming for a price closer to $105. While $110 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get closer to his target by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to see how committed Alice is to selling at a higher price. It also puts pressure on Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $105.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Offer:** Bob proposes a midpoint between his previous offer ($105) and Alice's latest offer ($110). 
* **Building Momentum:**  The message emphasizes a desire to find a fair deal and close the deal.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer aims to put pressure on Alice to accept, as the gap between their offers is shrinking."
