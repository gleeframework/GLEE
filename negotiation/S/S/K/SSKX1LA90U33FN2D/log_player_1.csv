Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150, there's a chance Bob might reject it. Offering it slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($150) increases the likelihood of a sale and a higher profit than you'd get from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures you make a significant profit. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise, polite, and highlights the value proposition for Bob."
