Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You can potentially still secure a deal above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing specifics, the message hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while being aware of Bob's potential rejection and your alternative buyer."
