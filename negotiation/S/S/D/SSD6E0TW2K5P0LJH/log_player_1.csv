Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the higher price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but never go below your minimum of $1,200,000."
