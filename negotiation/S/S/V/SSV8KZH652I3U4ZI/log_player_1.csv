Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm aware that Bob may reject this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $105. This is still higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to his range, hopefully leading to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $92 is close enough to my minimum acceptable value ($100).  It's also higher than what John is offering, so it's the best option in this situation."
