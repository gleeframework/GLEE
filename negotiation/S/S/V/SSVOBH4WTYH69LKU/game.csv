"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $900000?  I'm genuinely interested in this product and believe it could be a great fit for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you think it could be a great fit for you. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident this price is fair given the value I see in this product. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,
