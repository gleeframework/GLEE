Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $900000?  I'm genuinely interested in this product and believe it could be a great fit for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
