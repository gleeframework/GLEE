,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $110?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this done.",125.0,Bob,4,
