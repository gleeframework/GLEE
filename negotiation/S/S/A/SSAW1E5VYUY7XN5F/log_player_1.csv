Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $1,400,000 offer leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. I won't be pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can push for a higher price, potentially even closer to my initial $1,400,000 offer.
* **John as a fallback:**  Knowing John is waiting to buy, I'm not desperate and can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $1,350,000 for the product.  This gives you a fair price, and it's still a profitable deal for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate, but still allows me to secure a decent profit. 
* **Midpoint strategy:**  The $1,350,000 is a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it appear like a fair compromise.
* **Pressure tactics:**  By mentioning a ""profitable deal"" for me, I subtly imply that this might be my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept."
