"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it would be a smart investment for your business. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details.  If not, I have another buyer lined up who is happy to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is below her stated value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice, or allows you to proceed with buying from John at your desired price."
