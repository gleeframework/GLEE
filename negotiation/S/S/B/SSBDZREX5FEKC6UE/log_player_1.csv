Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This price is higher than Bob's valuation of $100, but it gives him some room to negotiate. It's also lower than my minimum value of $150, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:** To maximize potential profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** To incentivize Bob to make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain a safety net:** By having John as a backup buyer, I can walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away or engaging in prolonged negotiations is not worth it.  Selling to John for the same price offers no additional benefit."
