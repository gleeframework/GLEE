"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John, as I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price of $8,000, hoping Alice might be willing to negotiate closer to my budget. This also sets a clear starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Alice. I'll continue to try and find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still staying within a comfortable range. $9,500 is a good middle ground, and I believe it's a price Alice might be more receptive to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10750.  This price is reasonable considering the product's value, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not ready to buy from John just yet. I'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. $10,000 is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a good compromise.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer as it's getting closer to her desired price while still staying within my budget."
