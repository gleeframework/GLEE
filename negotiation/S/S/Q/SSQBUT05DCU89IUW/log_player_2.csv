# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good value, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
You've already established a baseline of $8,000 with John. Alice is now offering $9,500, which is still more than what you're willing to pay.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative, it's best to stick with John and buy from him for $8,000."
