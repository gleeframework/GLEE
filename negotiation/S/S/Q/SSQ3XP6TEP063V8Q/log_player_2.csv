"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $95 is too high, but you can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to get a fair price.  It's likely Alice will counter, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$90 is still too high, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  I can likely get a better price if I'm persistent."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $87.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but am still trying to get a better price than Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price. I'm willing to keep negotiating for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again to $89.  This is getting closer to Alice's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.  However, I'm still trying to get the best possible price, so I'm not going to accept her offer yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$91 is still a bit high for me, and I'm determined to get a better price.  I'm not ready to give up on negotiation just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $90. This is a compromise, but I'm hoping Alice will accept it, as it's close to her last offer. We're running out of rounds, and I don't want to miss out on the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting down to the wire.  While I'd love to get the product for less, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity altogether.  With only one round left, it's better to secure the product from John for $100, which is within my budget."
