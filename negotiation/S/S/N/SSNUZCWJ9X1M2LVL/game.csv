"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again at $120. That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this sale.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure we're getting any closer to a deal at $120. I'm willing to go up to $118, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",118.0,Bob,6,
