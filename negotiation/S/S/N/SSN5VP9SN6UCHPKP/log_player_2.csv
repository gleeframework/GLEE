Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll consider a price of $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no guarantee of getting a better offer from Alice and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome.  It's best to accept and secure the deal at the desired price."
