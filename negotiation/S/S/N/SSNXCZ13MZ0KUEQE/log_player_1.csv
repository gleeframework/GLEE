Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies strong demand (""interest I've already received"") to justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob negotiates down, we can still aim for a price higher than his $8,000 valuation. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so any offer above that is a win."
