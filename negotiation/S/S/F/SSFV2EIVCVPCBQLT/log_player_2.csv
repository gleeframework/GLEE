"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering its value to me, I'd be happy to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15500? I'm confident you'll find the product worth that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and try to get closer to your target of $15,000."
