"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $17000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering its value to me, I'd be happy to pay $14000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15250.  This is a fair compromise considering both our positions.",15250.0,Bob,4,
