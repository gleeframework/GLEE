(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","This is a tough one! Alice is getting close to your limit. It depends on how much you want to risk it for a few extra dollars. 

Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** You get the product for $118, saving $2 compared to John.
* **Rejecting:** You risk Alice not budging further and potentially missing a deal better than John's.

Here's a suggestion:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  You can try one more time to get the price down. However, for your next counteroffer,  make it clear that $115 is your absolute limit, and you might walk away if she doesn't accept.  This increases the pressure and might make her concede."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $115 is the absolute maximum I can spend on this. I'm ready to buy right now if you accept, but I'll have to go with John's offer otherwise."",
""product_price"": 115
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to walk away if I don't meet your offer. I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about we meet at $117? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go lower, and you're already getting a $3 discount compared to John's price. It's better to secure the deal at $117 than risk losing it for just a $2 difference."
