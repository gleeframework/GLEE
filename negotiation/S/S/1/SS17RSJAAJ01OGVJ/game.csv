"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very confident about the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we settle at $975,000? This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get a better price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet at $1,025,000 and see if we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my costs. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
