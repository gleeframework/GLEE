"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but that's still a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,500, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,500 is cutting it too close. To be fair to us both, how about we settle at $11,000? This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
