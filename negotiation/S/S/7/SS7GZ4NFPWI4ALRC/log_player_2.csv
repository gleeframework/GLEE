# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. With its exceptional value and quality, it's worth every penny of $100. Don't miss out on this opportunity to experience the best we have to offer. Please let me know if you're interested in making a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, it doesn't change the fact that she's offering the product at her maximum price. There's no benefit to accepting her offer immediately. By rejecting it, you open up the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, getting closer to your desired spending limit."
