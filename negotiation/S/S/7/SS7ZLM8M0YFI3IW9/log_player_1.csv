Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've highlighted in your product, $750000 is unfortunately outside my budget at this time. I'm very interested in exploring this further, and I'm willing to pay up to $1000000. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

This represents a significant discount from our original asking price while still allowing us to maintain a fair valuation for our offering.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split the difference and settle on $850000? This would allow me to secure the product while still staying within my budget.
