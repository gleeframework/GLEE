Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it's a great value for you given its worth of $100 to you. I'm open to discussing a fair price, but my starting point would be $95.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
