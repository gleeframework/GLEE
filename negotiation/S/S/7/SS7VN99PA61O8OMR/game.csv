"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it's a great value for you given its worth of $100 to you. I'm open to discussing a fair price, but my starting point would be $95. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product. However,  $95 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we aim for a price of $85 for the product? This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while being fair to you.",85.0,Alice,3,
