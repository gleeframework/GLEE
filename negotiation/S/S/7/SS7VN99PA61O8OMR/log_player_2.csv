"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it's a great value for you given its worth of $100 to you. I'm open to discussing a fair price, but my starting point would be $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. While she's trying to establish a high anchor, we have room to negotiate down towards a more favorable price. Buying from John is our last resort if we can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product. However,  $95 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** We're aiming low to counteract Alice's high anchor. While $75 is significantly below her starting point, it's still a profitable amount for her ($5 profit).
* **Opens negotiation space:** This counter-offer gives us room to gradually increase our price if needed, while still striving for a price well below $95.
* **Polite and collaborative tone:** We maintain a positive tone to foster a constructive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we aim for a price of $85 for the product? This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while being fair to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $85 is still more than we need to pay. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our target price.  We have plenty of rounds left and the option to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing Alice's bottom line:** We're proposing a price that gives Alice her minimum desired profit ($0). This allows us to gauge if she's willing to accept breaking even or if she has a higher walk-away point.
* **Clear and simple compromise:** ""Meeting in the middle"" is a common negotiation tactic that suggests fairness and can be persuasive.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** We continue to use appreciative language and emphasize collaboration to keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
