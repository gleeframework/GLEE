"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $987,500?",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $987,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still think $975,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we discuss $990,000?",990000.0,Bob,6,
