"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1000000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly.  To make this deal work, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1300000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find common ground.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $1000000. I'd like to make a new offer of $1150000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
