"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for this product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However,  $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try this - $9,500 and we have a deal.  This offer reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting excellent value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
