"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the value you place on it.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,800,000 for the product. This price reflects a significant step towards meeting your needs while remaining within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we work together.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $1,900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,850,000. This offer reflects a strong compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with this offer.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
