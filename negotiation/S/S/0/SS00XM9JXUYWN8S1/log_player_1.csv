Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $1,900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,850,000. This offer reflects a strong compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is a good deal.  It surpasses my minimum by a significant amount and avoids the risk of negotiations failing."
