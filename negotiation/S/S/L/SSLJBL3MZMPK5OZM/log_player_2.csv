Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice or by buying from John. At this point, the price from John is only $250 more than Alice's offer, so there's not a lot of room for Alice to come down further. However, Bob might still be able to get Alice to accept a price closer to his target of $10,750."

# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and $11,000, so how about $11,250?

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is unwilling to come down to a price lower than $11,250, which is only $250 less than John's price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
