"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth considering a price of $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1200000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While she claims to meet you halfway, it's still $200,000 above your maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  You have 10 rounds and a backup option (John), so there's room to negotiate a better price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to discuss further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll counter with $1325000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's coming down, it's still $125,000 above your budget. 
* **Negotiation potential:** You're still early in the negotiation process, and it's clear Alice is willing to negotiate. By continuing to reject, you can potentially push for a better price. 
* **Backup option:** You have a backup option (John) to fall back on if you don't reach a satisfactory price with Alice."

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's continuing to come down, it's still $100,000 above your budget.
* **Negotiation potential:**  You've only had five rounds and both parties are showing flexibility.  There's still good potential to reach a deal closer to your budget.
* **Backup option:** You have a backup option (John) to fall back on, so you have the luxury of holding out for a better deal.
* **Potential for counteroffer:** You can counter with a lower price, showing your commitment to finding a solution that works for both parties."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, $1,300,000 is still out of my price range.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  She's not budging much, and even though she's coming down, it's still above your budget.
* **Limited rounds:** With only three rounds left, the potential for significant price reduction is limited.
* **Backup option is attractive:**  John is offering the product at your maximum budget, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Alice.
* **Time is a factor:** The longer you negotiate, the greater the chance of losing the product altogether. Buying from John provides certainty and avoids further risk."
