Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a strong opening position.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much, but I'm prepared to come down if necessary to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a strong position. This is a fair middle ground, and I'm confident he'll see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $920,000 is a good price and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from Bob.  It's also significantly better than selling to John."
