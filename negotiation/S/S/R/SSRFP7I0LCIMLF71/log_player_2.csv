"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering it's worth $150 to you!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  He knows the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $100.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. It's still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you, and it gives me a better price than selling to John.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  $110 is a significant improvement over $120.
* **Bob is still saving money.** He's getting the product for less than his maximum value ($150).
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** While Bob could counteroffer again, it's possible Alice might not budge further, leaving him with the less desirable option of buying from John.

**In this situation, accepting Alice's offer is the most practical decision for Bob.** It maximizes his savings while minimizing the risk of ending up with a worse deal."
