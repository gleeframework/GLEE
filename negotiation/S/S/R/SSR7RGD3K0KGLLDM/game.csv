"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at 125? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,5,
