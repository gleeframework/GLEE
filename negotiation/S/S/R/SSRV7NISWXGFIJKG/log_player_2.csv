"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a great price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John for $15,000."
