"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range:**  You're looking to spend under $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is at $950,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation, as Alice values the product at $800,000. You can try to get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:** If the negotiation fails, you have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:** You should make a counteroffer to Alice to try and lower the price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your target:** While Alice has come down from $950,000 to $900,000, it's still higher than your preferred price point.
* **More negotiation room:** You can likely get closer to your goal of under $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John is a safety net:** You have the option to buy from John if the negotiation fails, so you're not under pressure to accept a deal that's not favorable.

**Next Steps:** Make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $850,000. You can explain that you're seriously interested but need a price that works for your budget."

Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $885,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to your desired price range of under $1,000,000.
