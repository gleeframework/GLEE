Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and leaves room for a successful deal. Let me know what you think.
