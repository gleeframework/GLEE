"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and leaves room for a successful deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows me to purchase it while still giving you a good return. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",885000.0,Alice,5,
