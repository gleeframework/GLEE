Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900,000 to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not getting any younger. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your offer, which is $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm closer to her value. While ideally, we'd like to get the product for our ideal price, at this point, we're getting a $187,500 discount from John's price.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we risk her walking away entirely. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
