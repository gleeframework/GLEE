,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. Would you be willing to consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
