"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. This is my best offer, as it's my maximum limit.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to buy the product today.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $13,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise further at $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs.",15500.0,Alice,5,
