Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go any lower than $900,000.  This price still provides a significant benefit for you, and it's the closest I can get to your offer. Let's make this deal happen. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down considerably in price, and $900,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. While there might be a slight chance of getting the price lower, it's getting riskier. Alice seems firm on $900,000, and pushing further might lead to a breakdown in negotiation."
