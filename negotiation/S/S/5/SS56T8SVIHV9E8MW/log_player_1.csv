Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's slightly below Bob's estimated value, hoping to secure a good deal while leaving room for potential negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

While $13,500 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still keeping it below my desired price. I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's appealing to both of us."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous option.  It's better than my backup option of selling to John for $12,000."
