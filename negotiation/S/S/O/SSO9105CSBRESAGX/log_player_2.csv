"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Buying from Alice for $10,000 saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **It's a good deal for Alice:** Even though Alice values the product at $8,000, she is making a $2,000 profit. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
