"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a deal with you, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: While Alice's message is enthusiastic, $1,100,000 is significantly more than your $800,000 fallback option with John. You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
