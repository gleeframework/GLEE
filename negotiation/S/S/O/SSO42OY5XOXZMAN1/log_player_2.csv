"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's a good starting point, it's still well above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're making a significant effort to reach a deal, Bob. However, I need to consider my minimum acceptable price, and $900,000 is still below that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that we'll get stuck in a stalemate.  It's more efficient to go with the guaranteed price from John, even if it means losing some of the potential benefits of this product."
