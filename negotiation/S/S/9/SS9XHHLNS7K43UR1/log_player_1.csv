Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum value, but still a good profit for me.  I'm confident that Bob will find this attractive, but if he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than his initial value of $8,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $9,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to get closer to my desired price. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's initial offer and my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I would prefer a bit more, I'm confident that further negotiations might not result in a significantly higher price.  It's  a good deal for me considering the time investment and the risk of further negotiation. I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
