"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at a fair price.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price seems a bit high to me. I'm interested, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. How about we try $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not there yet.  To make this work, I'd need to see something closer to $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,125,000 is getting closer, but it's still a touch high for me.  Would you consider $1,090,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1090000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However,  $1,090,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to budge a little more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,105,000? That's a fair price that gives us both some room to work with.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,105,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you moving your price.  To make this work on my end, I could do $1,100,000.  That's a firm offer, but I hope it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. $1,100,000 is a good offer, and I appreciate your willingness to come up.  To be fair, I'd need to see $1,102,500 to close this deal.  It's just a small difference, but it allows me to meet my minimum.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,102,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,102,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very attached to that $1.2M valuation. While we could likely push her a tiny bit further, the difference at this point is negligible. Accepting at $1,102,500 secures a significant discount and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
