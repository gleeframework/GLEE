# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $150 to you. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? We're confident it will significantly enhance your experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and John is also selling the product for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. By rejecting it, you maintain the option of buying from John if you decide to purchase the product."
