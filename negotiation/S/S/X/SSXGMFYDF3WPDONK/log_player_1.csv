Bob's offer:

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $950,000 is too low.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  He's getting closer to my minimum, but I think I can still get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,005,000 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him completely and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
