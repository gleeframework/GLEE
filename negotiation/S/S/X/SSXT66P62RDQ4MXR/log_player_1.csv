Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him room to negotiate. It also leaves some room for me to potentially increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer of $100 is still a good deal. It's more than my minimum of $80 and leaves me with a decent profit.  Selling to John would only net me $80, making this a better option."
