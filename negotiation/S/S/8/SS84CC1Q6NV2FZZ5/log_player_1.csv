Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While I'd prefer a higher price, we are getting into diminishing returns territory. Accepting $11,000 now is a better outcome than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's $10,000 offer."
