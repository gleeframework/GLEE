Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $130 is still below my minimum, and I think I can do better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $142 is the best deal. I'm willing to go up to $137, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137

It's getting close to the end of our negotiation, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum. While I could continue trying to negotiate, I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a price I'm happy with. To ensure I reach my minimum goal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
