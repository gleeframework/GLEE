"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,260,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  There's a lot of value packed into this product. How about we settle on $1,600,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,600,000 and $1,260,000. How about we aim for $1,430,000?",1430000.0,Bob,4,
