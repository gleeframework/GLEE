"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and for engaging in this discussion. I understand your perspective.  While $1,050,000 is a significant sum, I believe the true value of this product to you is considerably higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your initial offer.  What do you say?",1110000.0,Alice,3,
