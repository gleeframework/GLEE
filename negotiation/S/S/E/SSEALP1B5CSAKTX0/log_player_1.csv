Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $90. Would you be interested in buying it?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that doesn't make me at least my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $75 is a fair compromise. It's above my minimum and shows Bob is willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
