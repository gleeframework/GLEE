Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $120 (John), I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a strategic move. It's just below my minimum acceptable price but still significantly more than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Potential for Acceptance:** There's a chance Bob might find the deal attractive enough to accept, especially if he perceives some urgency or additional value not factored into his initial $100 valuation.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential gain of $19 over selling to John makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
