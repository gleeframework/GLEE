"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my expected value and still leaves you a substantial profit margin. I understand this is a significant investment, so please let me know if you have any questions. I'm confident you'll find this offer compelling.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
