Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $160. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still potentially securing a price closer to your ideal.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone even higher. If he rejects it, his counter-offer will reveal how much he values the product. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives you leverage. You don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am only willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 matches John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, especially since his initial counter-offer is already a significant jump from his perceived value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $140, we're showing Bob that we're willing to negotiate and find a compromise. This can encourage him to do the same.
* **Profit Margin:** $140 is still a significant profit above our minimum of $120.
* **Pressure:** Offering a middle ground puts a bit of pressure on Bob. He now knows we're willing to walk away if he doesn't budge, especially since we have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to stick to my original offer of $120. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm on his offer of $120, indicating he's unlikely to go any higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further negotiation with Bob has a low chance of success and will only cost us time. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable profit of $120.

It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure a sure sale with John."
