"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $160? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $160. How about we meet at $145? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to compromise, but $145 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $152.50? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go up to $152.50. I'm sticking to my original compromise of $145. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about $150? It's the minimum I can accept, but it's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,7,
