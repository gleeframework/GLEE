"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to her value than mine. I should try and negotiate the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Starting Low:** I want to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price. While $65 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, it leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about buying but need a better price.
* **Polite and Open:** My message is respectful and avoids being confrontational. I want to keep the negotiation going smoothly. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  I haven't forgotten about John. He's my safety net if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $85 is closer to my limit, it's still above what John offers. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower, especially since she's showing flexibility. 
* **Strategic Counter-offer:** I need to make another counter-offer that signals I'm willing to compromise but also keeps me within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're finding some middle ground. How about we settle at $75? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Compromise but Stay Firm:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to compromise. However, I'm staying below $80 (John's price), keeping my options open.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I added ""ready to buy right now"" to signal I'm serious and potentially speed up the negotiation.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation polite and constructive, aiming for a win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Reached My Limit:** Alice's offer of $80 matches my maximum budget and what John is offering.
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:**  Further negotiation might not result in a lower price, and could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now saves me the time and effort of continuing the negotiation or switching to John."
