Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** $100 is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still gives him some room to negotiate.
* **John's offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, but I don't want to scare Bob away with an initial offer too close to $120.
* **Negotiation room:** Offering $100 leaves room for both of us to make counteroffers and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I can still try to negotiate with Bob to get closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $85 is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. 
* **Appealing to Bob's needs:**  Highlighting that it's still a good deal for Bob helps to keep him engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Progress towards agreement:** Moving towards the middle ground is more likely to lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're finding some middle ground. How about we settle at $75? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell for that low.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. Bob is showing interest and seems willing to compromise. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm confident I can get closer to my goal without jeopardizing the sale by going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  $80 is a final compromise offer. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still gives Bob a good deal.
* **Urgency:**  The message conveys urgency by suggesting a final price and suggesting that it's a good deal for both of us. This encourages Bob to close the deal.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone throughout the negotiation helps build rapport and keeps Bob engaged."
