"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's $15,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm coming down to $17,500. This is still above my minimum, but shows flexibility. Hopefully Bob will see the value and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$12,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. However, if the next round doesn't go my way, I might have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to come down to $16,000. This is a compromise, but still above John's offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable selling for $13,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. With only 4 rounds left, I need to start considering the possibility of selling to John if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $15,500. This is only $500 above John's offer, so it's getting risky.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about closing the deal and accept this final offer."
