"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a very high price, far above Bob's budget. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a significant counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also recognizes the initial price was too high. It gives Alice room to negotiate while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price point. It's better to continue negotiating and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
This counteroffer is Bob's absolute maximum price. It shows his commitment to getting a deal while giving Alice a chance to accept before he moves on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While this is a lower price than previous rounds, it's still above Bob's ideal price point and getting closer to his budget. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

Bob is willing to go a little higher than his maximum, showing a compromise, but still leaving room for Alice to come down. This price is a realistic midpoint between the two sides and could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice has been unwilling to come down to Bob's desired price range.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's not likely Alice will drop to Bob's price.  Buying from John for $12,000 is the most financially sensible option at this point."
