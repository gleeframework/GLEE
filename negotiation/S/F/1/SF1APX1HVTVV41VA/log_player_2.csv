Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This reflects a willingness to meet somewhere in the middle while still acknowledging the inherent value of what's on offer.
