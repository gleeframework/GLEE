"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This reflects a willingness to meet somewhere in the middle while still acknowledging the inherent value of what's on offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit much for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value you bring while working for me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
