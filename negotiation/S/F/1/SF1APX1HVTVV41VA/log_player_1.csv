"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value gives room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to frame the price in a positive light.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Indicating willingness to listen to Bob's thoughts encourages him to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** A strongly negative reaction might suggest he's not a serious buyer.
2. **Establish a high anchor:**  Even if this offer is rejected, it sets a high point in Bob's mind for subsequent discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is far below both my minimum ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,200,000). This suggests he's aiming for a very aggressive deal. While I want to negotiate, accepting such a low offer would leave significant money on the table. It's time to steer the negotiation closer to a more realistic range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This reflects a willingness to meet somewhere in the middle while still acknowledging the inherent value of what's on offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Shows I'm listening and taking his input into account.
* **Firm but Fair:** While I've come down from my initial price, I'm still holding firm above both my minimum and closer to the product's true worth to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  Framing it as ""fair to both of us"" emphasizes a win-win scenario, encouraging Bob to move closer to my range.

By taking this approach, I aim to:

* **Direct the negotiation upward:** Bob's aggressive offer needs to be countered with a strong position to shift the bargaining power.
* **Signal seriousness:**  This counter-offer indicates I'm serious about selling, but not desperate.
* **Maintain the option of John:** I'm still close enough to my guaranteed offer from John that walking away remains a viable option if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit much for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value you bring while working for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 now matches his own perceived value of the product. While it's still below my desired price, it represents a significant movement from his initial offer and is a reasonable compromise. 

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has skillfully negotiated up to his maximum price, demonstrating his commitment to acquiring the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push for a higher price could lead to Bob walking away. Accepting guarantees a good profit ($1,200,000 is a substantial gain) and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that can be put to use elsewhere. 

While selling to John is always an option, accepting Bob's offer secures a solid profit and brings a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiation."
