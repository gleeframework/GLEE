"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down from your original price. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11,000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $9,500. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",10800.0,Alice,5,
