"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,600,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,600,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. You have two options:

* **Counteroffer again:** You can try to negotiate further by sending a counteroffer closer to your budget.  This could be your final attempt before considering John's offer.
* **Buy from John:** At this point, you are very close to your budget with Alice's offer, so it might be worthwhile to simply buy from John at $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation. 

I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and will make a counteroffer in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,420,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,420,000 is still above my budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a good deal, I'm willing to walk away at this point and secure the product from John at a price that fits my budget.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get me to a lower price that I'm comfortable with."
