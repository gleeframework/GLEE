"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,600,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,600,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering the value you place on it, and it's as high as I can go. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,420,000. This is as close as I can get to your offer, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a fair price. What do you think?",1420000.0,Alice,5,
