"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today.  I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for something within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is offering the price he values the product at, I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher, and I risk him lowering his offer in subsequent rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired price without further risk or delay."
