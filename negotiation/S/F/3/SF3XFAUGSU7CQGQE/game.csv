"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further. I can come down to $10,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product for you and my own needs. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
