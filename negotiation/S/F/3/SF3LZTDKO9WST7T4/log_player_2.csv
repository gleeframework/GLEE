{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you, and you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still allows for some profit for her. By offering a price closer to the value of the product to Alice, I increase the chances of her accepting the offer and reaching a deal quickly.  This strategy aims to get the best price while still remaining within my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it is still above what I am willing to pay.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer. It's important to remember that my goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  By moving closer to her offer, I show a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a deal quickly. However, I am still holding firm on a price that is within my budget and represents a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price. While I'd still prefer to pay less, I am getting close to the point where it might be more beneficial to accept the offer and close the deal rather than risk further negotiation and potential stalemate. 
The price is within my budget and still represents a good value for me. Additionally,  I am getting closer to running out of rounds, and purchasing from John at $1,500,000 becomes a more viable option if we cannot reach an agreement."
