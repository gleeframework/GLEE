"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it could be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its potential value, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

This is a strong opening offer because:

* **It's ambitious but justifiable:**  The price is very close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **It emphasizes value:** The message highlights the product's benefits for Bob, making the price more palatable. 
* **It's open to negotiation:**  By using phrases like ""I'm offering"" and ""discuss,"" it sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,500,000). Accepting this offer would leave a lot of money on the table. While selling to John is an option, it's worth exploring if Bob is willing to negotiate closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below the value this product brings. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the fair market value and the substantial benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly higher than Bob's offer:** This demonstrates you're serious about getting a fair price and not willing to settle for a lowball offer.
* **Still within a reasonable range for Bob:** The new price provides a good profit margin for you while remaining below Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification and emphasis on value:** By reiterating the product's benefits, you remind Bob why it's worth a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but I'm working with a specific budget. Could we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate for more, it's getting close to the point where the potential gains might not outweigh the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
