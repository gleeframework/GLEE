"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1200000 to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1080000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your counteroffer. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1050000. However, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1080000 and $1050000. I'll offer it to you for $1065000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1065000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go above $1050000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to buy the product from John for $1000000, so I think we're at an impasse. I'll make one final offer: $1050000, and that's my last offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
