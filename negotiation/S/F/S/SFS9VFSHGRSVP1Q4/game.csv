"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, but I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
