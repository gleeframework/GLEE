"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great value for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,900. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9,900. I'm willing to meet you at $10,150. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10150.0,Alice,7,
