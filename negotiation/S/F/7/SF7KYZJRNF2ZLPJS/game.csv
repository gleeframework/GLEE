"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $8,750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,7,
