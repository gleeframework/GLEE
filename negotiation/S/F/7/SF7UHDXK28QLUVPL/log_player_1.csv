"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity to invest in something truly special. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number. I'm emphasizing the ""unique features and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, clearly signaling that I'm open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  While I'm engaging with Bob, I'm aware I have the option of John at $1,500,000 if negotiations falter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob meeting me ""halfway"" is a tactic, not a genuine reflection of the product's value. His offer is still significantly below my minimum. I'll counter in the next round to steer the negotiation closer to a price I find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate you meeting me on the price, the product's value is significantly higher than your current proposal. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000, reflecting its true worth and the potential it holds for your business. This offer stands as a testament to my interest in seeing this product benefit you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession to show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage more seriously.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value, anchoring the negotiation around its potential benefits for Bob's business.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The $2,000,000 price point keeps me well above my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Time Consideration:**  As we progress through the rounds, I'm becoming more conscious of the time constraint and the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches the price John is willing to pay. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate.
* **Uncertainty of Further Negotiation:** There's no guarantee that Bob would go higher, and continuing could result in a lower final price or losing the deal altogether."
