"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $125. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",110.0,Alice,5,
