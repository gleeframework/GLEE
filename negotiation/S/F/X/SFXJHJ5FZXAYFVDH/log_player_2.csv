"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $100. I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay something closer to $80."", 
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Realistic but Optimistic:** $80 is a price that would be a great deal for you while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates that you're interested but firm on your budget, encouraging Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $125. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $125 is still more than you need to pay. You can try to negotiate a bit further, knowing you have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice.  I appreciate it.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $90.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to buy."", 
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** You're increasing your offer, showing Alice you're willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Firm:** The increase is relatively small, keeping the pressure on Alice to move closer to your range.
* **Budget Clarity:**  By mentioning your budget, you're setting a boundary while still leaving room for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer and the lowest she will go. 
* **Minimal Savings:** Even if you could negotiate Alice down a little more, it would likely be a small amount. The difference is no longer significant enough to warrant the risk of losing the guaranteed $100 price from John. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a sure thing at your target price. There's no need to risk Alice walking away and leaving you with nothing."
