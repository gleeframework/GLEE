{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're still profitable if Bob accepts. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth that might lead to a more agreeable price for both of you. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy depending on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, you can always consider lowering your price a bit, but be cautious about going too low, as you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to settle for right now.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,250,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,225,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you're looking for.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a price we both agree on.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give it away for a price that doesn't make sense for me."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,225,000 is still a little low for me.  Let's try $1,240,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,240,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,237,500 for the product. I hope this revised offer is within your consideration.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to go any higher.  It's time to move on and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to have sold to Bob,  I'm confident that selling to John will ensure I get the best possible price for my product."
