"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for your use case.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your business. Let's find a middle ground - I propose $1,950,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still acknowledging your initial offer.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,950,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a substantial offer considering my budget and the need to secure a profitable return. Let's compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price point.  To demonstrate my willingness to make a deal happen, I'll come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my desire to see this product put to good use in your capable hands.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
