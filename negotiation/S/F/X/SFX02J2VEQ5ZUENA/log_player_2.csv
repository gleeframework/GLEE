Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your business.

Let's compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
