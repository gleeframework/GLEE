Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John, who will buy the product at our minimum acceptable price. This allows us to be more firm in our negotiation with Bob."
