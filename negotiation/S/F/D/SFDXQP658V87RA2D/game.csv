"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $800,000, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I've already met you halfway and compromised, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're still interested, I'm willing to continue the negotiation, but I won't budge from this price.",850000.0,Alice,7,,
