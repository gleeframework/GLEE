Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly better deal.  
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it too low might make Bob think the product isn't valuable or that I'm desperate to sell.

It's a balancing act between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob doesn't reject the offer outright."
