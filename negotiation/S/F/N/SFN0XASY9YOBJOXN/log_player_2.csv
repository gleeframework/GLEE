Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $775,000? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let's find a solution we're both happy with.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $740,000 is getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $745,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, let's finalize it!

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and this price is significantly below John's offer.  Taking the deal now guarantees the best possible outcome for Bob."
