"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $10,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $11,000?  That's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10750?  It's a fair price for both of us and would let us close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to $11,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $10,900. That's a fair compromise, and it lets us finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10900}
