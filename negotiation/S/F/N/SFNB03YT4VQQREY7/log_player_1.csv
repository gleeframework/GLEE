Bob's offer:

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a good deal, and I can still make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my target price and I want to avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely.  It's better to accept and secure the deal."
