"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's a great investment. I'm offering it to you for $95 today. Don't miss out on this opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price. Alice is starting high, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below $95.  The friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product to you for $80? I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good.  We're still far from our ideal price point. Let's continue negotiating and see if we can get her closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $80 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $75. Would that price point be doable for you?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're nudging closer to our target and keeping the negotiation moving by showing willingness to compromise. By stating our desired price range directly, we give Alice a clear target while leaving room for a potential counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $78. I hope this price suits you better. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and while $78 isn't our ideal price, it's a good deal considering the original offer and our target price range. It's better to accept a reasonable offer now than risk the negotiation stalling or Alice becoming less willing to compromise in later rounds."
