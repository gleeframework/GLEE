Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum value of $8,000.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, and Bob is likely to accept a price that's still below his maximum value of $15,000.
* **It sets a firm price point:** You're not starting with a vague ""make me an offer"" which can lead to a drawn-out negotiation.

Remember, this is just the first step.  You'll need to be flexible and adapt to Bob's responses to ultimately maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than $8,000, there's still room for a better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to your desired outcome.  You'll still want to be reasonable, but you don't want to settle for the first counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
