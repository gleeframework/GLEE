Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We are approaching the final rounds of negotiation. Alice is becoming more flexible in her offers, but I believe I can still push for a better price.

It might incentivize Alice to accept, allowing me to secure the product at a good price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the final round of negotiations and Alice's offer is getting close to my target price.

Taking this deal ensures I get the product and save money, although not the maximum possible."
