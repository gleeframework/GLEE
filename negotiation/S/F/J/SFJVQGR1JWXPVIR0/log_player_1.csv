"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to move a little on my price. How about $12,500?  That's a fair offer considering John is offering a similar product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can negotiate a better price. If Bob continues to be unwilling to compromise, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're moving closer to my price point. However, $12,500 is still a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch to $13,000, but that's really as high as I can go. I think that's a fair deal considering John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still hesitant to accept $13,000. It's only $2,000 away from my minimum, and I'm hoping to squeeze out a slightly higher price. I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  $13,500 is my final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to John's offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
