"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit below my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? ",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,500 is close, but I need to get at least $14,250 for it.  This is my final offer.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000?  That's a good middle ground for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
