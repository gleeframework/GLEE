"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that considers both its value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still providing you a good deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my ideal budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  I'm eager to reach a deal and feel this price is a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $825,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000 to get this done today. It's a strong offer and reflects my serious interest in the product.",780000.0,Bob,6,
