Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product ahead of other interested buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a better deal. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he might be willing to pay. If he outright rejects it, you can always counter with a lower price, moving closer to your minimum. 
* **Time Value:** While you have John as a backup, a quicker sale to Bob might be preferable even if it means slightly less profit. This offer factors in the potential for a faster transaction."
