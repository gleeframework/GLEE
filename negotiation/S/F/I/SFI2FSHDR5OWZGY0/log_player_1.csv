Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000). 
* **Strong Starting Point:** $12,000 is a significant markup from your minimum but still a good deal for Bob, potentially leading to a quick sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong offer, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, giving you the flexibility to potentially earn even more.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so you don't want to go below that price with Bob."
