"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,500 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for Bob. This is still better than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away or counter with a higher price. Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob."
