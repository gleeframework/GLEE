"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,500 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
