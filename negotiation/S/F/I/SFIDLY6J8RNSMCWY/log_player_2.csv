"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $100, which is still above your desired price. 
* There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my ideal $120 limit.
* $90 represents a reasonable compromise, giving Alice a profit while also saving me money.
* This counteroffer shows I'm serious about buying the product, but not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $105, which is closer to my ideal price of $120 than my previous counteroffer of $90. 
* While I'd still prefer to pay less, it's not a significant enough difference to justify risking further negotiation or paying the full $120 to John.
* Accepting the offer allows me to get the product at a reasonable price and avoid the potential for a drawn-out negotiation."
