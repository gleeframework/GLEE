"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to offer $1,050,000. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify right now.  To show my seriousness in acquiring it, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, considering I have other options available.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,225,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer - $1,150,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my bottom line. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm committed to making this happen, and I'm willing to offer $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going any lower. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
