"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear I'm open to discussion, showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Me:** $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's room for negotiation. Bob is showing interest, so I can try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Not Risking John:** Selling to John right now would secure $10,000, but I might be able to get a better deal with Bob.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $11,500, which is still above my minimum but closer to his offer.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair price considering the product's value.
* **Open to Agreement:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and closer to my desired price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows me to avoid further negotiation.
* **Risk of Losing Bob:** If I reject his offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only the $10,000 offer from John. 

This seems like a good deal, and it's time to close it."
