"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room to bargain. Rejecting the initial offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows my willingness to negotiate. It's unlikely she'll accept this right away, but it sets the stage for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a price closer to my desired range. There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving me time to work towards a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to compromise.  The new offer is still within my budget and is closer to the middle ground between our previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with $1,400,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a better price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially as we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but this time I'm getting closer to Alice's last offer. This shows her that I'm serious about closing the deal and that we are getting closer to an agreement. I'm also still within my budget and I believe there's a good chance Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is within my budget and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially reaching a stalemate is high. Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
