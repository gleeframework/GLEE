"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a significant value, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I value your business, $775,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,
