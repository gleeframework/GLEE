Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $119 is just below your guaranteed sale price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting while still securing a near-optimal profit. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
