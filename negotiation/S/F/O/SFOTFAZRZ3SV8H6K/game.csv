"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $12,000. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $12,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",12250.0,Alice,5,
