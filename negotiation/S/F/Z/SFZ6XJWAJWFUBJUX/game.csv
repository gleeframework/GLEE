"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Would you be willing to accept this price?",925000.0,Bob,4,
