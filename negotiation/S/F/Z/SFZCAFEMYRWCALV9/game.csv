"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is significantly higher.  I believe it's a price that works well for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to continue this negotiation in good faith. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,000,000. This would allow us both to walk away happy with a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
