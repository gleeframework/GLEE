"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's worth to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $925,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
