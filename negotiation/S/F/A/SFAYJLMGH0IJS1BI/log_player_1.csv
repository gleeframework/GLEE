Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $750,000.  Do you think that would work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, it's clear he's aiming for a significantly lower price. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
