"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $750,000.  Do you think that would work?",750000.0,Bob,4,
