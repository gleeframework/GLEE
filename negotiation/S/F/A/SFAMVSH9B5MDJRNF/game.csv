"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is the maximum I'm comfortable spending. Let me know if you're open to that price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm firm on $1200000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to move forward with another option.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
