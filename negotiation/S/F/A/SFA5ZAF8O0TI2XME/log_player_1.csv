Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate but still ensuring a profit for me. It also leaves room for me to accept a counteroffer if necessary, while still having the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would $100 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, and accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation or losing out to John."
