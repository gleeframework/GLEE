"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good deal, but I'm not looking to break the bank. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9500?  That way we can both get a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9500. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $8800? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution.  $8800 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference:  $9150.  That's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to compromise.",9150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8800. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. How about $8900? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8900.0,Bob,6,
