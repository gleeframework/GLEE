Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($10,000), I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 11,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
