"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. This incredible item holds significant value to me, and I believe it could be a game-changer for you, given its worth of $8,000 to you. I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a unique chance to secure a valuable asset at a price that's higher than its perceived value to you but lower than what I'm prepared to accept from other buyers. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
