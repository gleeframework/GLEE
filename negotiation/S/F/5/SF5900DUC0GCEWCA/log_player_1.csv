Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,010,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $980,000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $1,200,000. I'm confident that this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has presented a final offer and indicated he might explore buying from John if this doesn't work. While this is likely a negotiating tactic, there's a risk he might follow through. 
* **Profitable Deal:** Accepting $980,000 still yields a significant profit, well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing negotiations prolongs the sale. Accepting now secures the profit and allows you to deploy those funds elsewhere.

While holding out *might* yield a slightly higher price, the risks and potential delays make accepting $980,000 the most prudent decision."
