Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also sets a high starting point. I believe this strategy balances maximizing potential profits with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
