"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to keep the price at $100 if possible. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $105 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $108.  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us.  Let's get this deal done!",108.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to stick to my budget of $100 if possible. Would $107 be acceptable to you?",107.0,Bob,6,
