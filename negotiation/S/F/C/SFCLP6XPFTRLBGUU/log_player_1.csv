"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit.  Since I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'm setting the bar high.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is too low for me. It's less than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a profit.  $95 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to keep negotiating, but I'm also watching the clock and keeping John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is getting close to my minimum. I'm taking the offer. It's  a better deal than selling to John, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob."
