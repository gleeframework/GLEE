"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground and make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer the product for $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
