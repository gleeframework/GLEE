"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product at a price that I believe is fair for both of us.  I'm asking $1300000.  It's a significant investment, but I know this product will be incredibly valuable to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end and still allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You can likely negotiate further with Alice to try and get closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. To show my commitment to making this happen, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's the closest I can come to your offer while still covering my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point and you're already in a lengthy negotiation.  Given that you can buy the same product from John for a lower price of $800,000, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer."
