"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that has the potential to revolutionize the industry. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $600000 for it, but only if we can close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. Considering the product's potential and its value to the right buyer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its worth. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $700000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $650000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly at this price.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $650000. Considering the product's value and potential returns, I'm willing to offer it to you for $675000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this unique opportunity. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
