"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is significantly lower than what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is a fair compromise considering I'm willing to make a deal today.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob.  While $14,500 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking something a bit higher.  Would you consider $16,000? This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm going to push a little harder and offer $15,500.  This is a solid price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here.",15500.0,Bob,6,
