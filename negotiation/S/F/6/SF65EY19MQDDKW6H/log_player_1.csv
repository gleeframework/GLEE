Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than $80, giving Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. 

This strategy allows you to potentially maximize your profit while also keeping the negotiation open for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident this product is worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to stick to my budget of $85 for this product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already had two rounds of negotiations with Bob, and it seems unlikely he'll budge much further.  I'd rather sell to John for $120 and avoid further haggling."
