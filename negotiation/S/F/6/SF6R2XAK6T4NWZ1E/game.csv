,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it, as that's the maximum value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $175. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer if you're not willing to accept it.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $165. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",165.0,Alice,5,
