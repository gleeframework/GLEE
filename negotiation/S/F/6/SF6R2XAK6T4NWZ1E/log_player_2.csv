{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're only willing to pay $150 for the product.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price.**  You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it, as that's the maximum value I see in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $175. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While closer to your desired price, it's still above your $150 limit.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.** You can continue to try and push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer if you're not willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $165. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're only willing to pay $150.
* **You've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to get you a better price.**
* **Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price.** This is the most sensible option at this point."
