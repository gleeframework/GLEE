Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm aiming high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I believe there's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay more than my minimum, and this initial offer gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Back-up plan:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000, so I'm not risking losing out on a good deal."
