Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim for a price higher than that.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can potentially still secure a price higher than her guaranteed sale. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message positions the price as ""fair"" while highlighting the ""potential benefits"" for Bob. This framing might make the offer more appealing.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice will sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out on the product's minimum value to her."
