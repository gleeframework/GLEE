"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12500 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. This is my top offer, as it's close to what I'd pay elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000. It's my final offer, as I have other options available.",8000.0,Bob,4,
