Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, accepting $9,000 is a decent outcome and avoids the risk of him backing out entirely or me having to sell to John for $12,000."
