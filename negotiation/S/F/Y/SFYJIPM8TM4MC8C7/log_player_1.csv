Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $850,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000.  This is still a fantastic price for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and so am I.  $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'll see if I can push for a bit more.  I'll make another counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us closer.  I'm prepared to offer $910,000 to get this done today.  It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in closing the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $910,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $910,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $915,000.
