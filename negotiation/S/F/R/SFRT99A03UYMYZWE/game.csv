"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and agree on $800000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was hoping we could get closer to my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $800000, so I'm offering the product to you for $825000. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
