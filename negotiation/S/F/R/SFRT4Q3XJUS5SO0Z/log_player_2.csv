"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, and Bob has a maximum value of $120, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $105 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $97.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it agreeable."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $102.50. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings, and I think it's worth it for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob has rejected Alice's initial offer and countered twice. Alice has come down in price from $120 to $102.50.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might become unwilling to budge further, and Bob could end up paying $120 to John.  Accepting the $102.50 offer gives Bob a decent discount and saves him money compared to buying from John."
