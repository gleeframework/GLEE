"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $110.  While that's a good deal, you can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer was $110. This counteroffer at $100 is a reasonable compromise that still leaves room for negotiation. It's a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still above her value of $80.  This will hopefully encourage her to accept, but if not, you can continue to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is very close to your counteroffer of $100. You can save $15 compared to buying from John.  At this point, it's more worthwhile to accept and move on than to risk further negotiation."
