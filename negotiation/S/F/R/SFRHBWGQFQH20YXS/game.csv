"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $130, which is still a great deal for you and a good profit for me. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of meeting in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on profit. I can do $125, which is my absolute minimum. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I can do $122, which is my last offer. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,7,
