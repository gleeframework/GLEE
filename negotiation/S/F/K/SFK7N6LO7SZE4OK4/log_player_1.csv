Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, but still secures a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Strong Initial Offer:** A strong initial offer shows confidence in the product's value and can potentially lead to a quicker deal. 

**Why not ask for the full $1,500,000?**

While tempting, this could make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and might scare him off.  A slightly lower offer makes him feel like he's getting a ""deal"" while still maximizing my potential profit."
