"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. My asking price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob.  While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, he wants to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit below my desired price point.  Let's compromise at $950,000.  This price allows me to earn a good return on my investment and offers you a significant value compared to other options.  I'm open to discussing further, but I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target.  He wants to save even more money, so rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, giving him plenty of time to try and close the deal at a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and go with $925,000.  This offer gives you a solid profit and allows me to stay within my budget. It's a win-win situation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
