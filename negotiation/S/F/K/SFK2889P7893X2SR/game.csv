"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be interested if you were willing to come down to $13,000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price. Let me know what you think!",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $14,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $13,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $14,000? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,5,
