"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,600,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $1,550,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my absolute final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
