Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I'm in a strong position. I can aim incredibly high with Bob, knowing I have a safety net.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The prompt states the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  This doesn't mean he *wouldn't* pay more, especially if he perceives the product as unique or essential.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a very high price ($1,900,000), I'm ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, the starting point sets a high bar.

**Important Note:** This strategy is aggressive.  There's a chance Bob might be completely turned off by the initial high price. However, the potential reward of nearly doubling my profit outweighs the risk in this scenario."
