"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $8,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $8,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $7,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,500. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his target.  There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue working towards his goal of $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $7,250?  It's a good compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 7250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,250. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $7,400? This is a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,400 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's target price of $7,000, and it's a significant savings compared to buying from John. At this point, continuing to negotiate might not yield much more savings, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing."
