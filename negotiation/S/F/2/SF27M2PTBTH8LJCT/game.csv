"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $8,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $7,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,500. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $7,250?  It's a good compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,250. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $7,400? This is a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good compromise.",7400.0,Alice,5,
