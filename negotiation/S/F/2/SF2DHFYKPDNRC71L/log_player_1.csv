Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,100,000. I know its value to you is significant, and I believe this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially exceed that amount. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.  This price is:
    * Substantially higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000)
    * Lower than John's guaranteed purchase price ($1,200,000)
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes a ""special price"" and a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this initial offer. If that happens, we can always negotiate down towards his perceived value, keeping in mind our guaranteed sale to John."
