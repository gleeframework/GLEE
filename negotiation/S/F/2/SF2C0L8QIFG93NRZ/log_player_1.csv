Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with $2,000,000, you establish a high reference point.  Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it might influence his counteroffer to be more favorable to you.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Remember, you have John willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This knowledge allows you to be more confident and potentially walk away from a lowball offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000 for this product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Engaged:** Bob's counteroffer at $1,800,000 shows he's seriously interested and willing to negotiate. This is a positive sign.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between Bob's offer and John's guaranteed offer ($1,800,000 vs. $1,500,000). It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further with Bob. 
* **Don't Settle Too Quickly:** Accepting the first counteroffer might leave money on the table. By countering, you demonstrate that you're also looking for a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to see it closer to $1,900,000.  This is a unique product with a lot of potential upside, which I think justifies the price."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Justifying the Price:** Highlighting the ""unique"" aspects and ""potential upside"" reinforces the value proposition to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** There's still some space between this counteroffer and your minimum acceptable price, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not your initial asking price, $1,700,000 is still a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely. Bob's offer is reasonable, and pushing further could make him walk away.
* **""Bird in Hand"" Principle:** It's often better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it by hoping for a slightly better one later."
