"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1400000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $1500000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You're getting the product for $1,400,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price. 
* **You're still getting a good deal.** The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and you're paying less than that.

While you might want to try and negotiate further with Alice, the current offer is the most advantageous to you."
