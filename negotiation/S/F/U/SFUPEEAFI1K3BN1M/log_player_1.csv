I'll reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's better to secure the $100 from John now than risk getting a lower price from Bob or not closing a deal at all."
