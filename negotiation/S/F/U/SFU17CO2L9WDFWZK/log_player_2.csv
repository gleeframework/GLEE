{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can definitely get a better deal than $900,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer is well below Alice's minimum acceptable price, but it's a starting point for negotiation.  This offer shows Bob is serious about getting the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a good deal for him.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might get stubborn or walk away entirely.  Accepting this offer is the safest and most practical choice."
