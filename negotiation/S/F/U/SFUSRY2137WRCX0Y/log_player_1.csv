{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This offer stands until [Set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll be moving forward with another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's always wise to aim higher initially. Bob's valuation of $1,000,000 gives you room to negotiate.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a strong offer that represents a significant profit for you while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for him to counter-offer while keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Setting a deadline creates urgency for Bob to act, preventing him from delaying the decision indefinitely.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning another buyer subtly reinforces the value of your product and the fact that you have other options if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price slightly downward, but remember your bottom line is $1,500,000."
