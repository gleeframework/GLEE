"Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800000 is below my minimum value, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product for $1200000. This price reflects the significant value the product can bring to your business, and it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still too high for me.  Considering the market value and my budget, I can offer $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1050000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this deal and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's try to reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
