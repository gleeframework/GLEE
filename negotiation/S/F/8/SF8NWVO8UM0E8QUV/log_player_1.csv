"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. I'm confident this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I will counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is below my minimum value, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still too high for me.  Considering the market value and my budget, I can offer $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still slightly below it. I'll try to push for a higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this deal and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
