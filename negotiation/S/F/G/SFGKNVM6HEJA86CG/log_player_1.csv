"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the negotiation higher and leaves room for concessions. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will give us valuable information for our next move. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the safety net of John's $1,200,000 offer, ensuring we never settle for less than our product's worth to us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price.  While his counter-offer was a substantial increase from his initial valuation, we have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the price you proposed is considerably below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,275,000?"",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession to signal flexibility and move the negotiation forward. However, we're still aiming for a price well above Bob's initial offer and closer to our desired value.
* **Justifying the Price:**  By mentioning ""true value,"" we subtly reinforce that our product is worth more than Bob's initial assessment.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** We're still open to John's offer if Bob doesn't meet us closer to our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below our guaranteed sale price with John.  We're willing to negotiate further, but we won't go below $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a fantastic product and a fair price.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're signaling that this is our final concession, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Slight Concession:** We're showing flexibility by dropping slightly below our previous offer, but staying firm above our guaranteed price with John.
* **Highlighting Value:** We reiterate the product's value to incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Direct Close:**  We end with a clear call to action, encouraging Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting your offer. I would like to propose a price of $1,180,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to meet our minimum price. We've made several concessions, clearly signaled our bottom line, and he's still significantly below. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk further time and potentially lower offers from Bob."
