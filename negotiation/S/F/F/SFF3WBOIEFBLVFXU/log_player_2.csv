"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject it and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

You're aiming for the $8,000 price from John, but you're willing to pay a little extra to see if Alice will budge. A counteroffer of $8,500 is a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price. Rejecting this offer and counter-offering again gives you another chance to potentially get a better deal without risking buying from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

You're still aiming for that $8,000 price, but you're willing to go slightly higher to see if you can find a middle ground with Alice. $9,000 is a good compromise, showing that you're serious about buying but still keeping your budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now offering $10,000, which is still higher than your ideal price. While you could continue to counteroffer, there's a chance she'll keep rejecting your offers. To avoid potentially getting stuck in a long negotiation with no guarantee of a better price, it's best to accept John's offer and buy the product for $8,000. You've saved yourself $2,000 and secured the product."
