Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but not that much. I'm offering the product for $10,500. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

At this point, it's likely Alice won't go much lower. Accepting at $10,500 secures a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price."
