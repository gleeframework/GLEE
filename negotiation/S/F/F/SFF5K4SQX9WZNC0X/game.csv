"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but not that much. I'm offering the product for $10,500. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
