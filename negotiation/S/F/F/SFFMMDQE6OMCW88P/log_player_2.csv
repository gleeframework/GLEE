"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer is too expensive.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, so he's starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This gives him room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than what he wants to pay.  He has the option to buy from John for $10,000, so he should keep trying to negotiate with Alice."

Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, and it's still within Bob's budget."
