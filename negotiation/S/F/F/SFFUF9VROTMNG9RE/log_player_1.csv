Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be immensely valuable to you, potentially saving you significant time and resources. Its value to you is easily $1,000,000.  I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,900,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a high anchor. This makes the final price seem like a better deal, even if it's still above Bob's initial valuation.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's benefits and potential ROI helps justify the high price, making it seem less arbitrary. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the product's value and the offer can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk:** There's a risk Bob might outright reject this high offer, pushing you to John (your guaranteed $1,000,000). However, the potential reward of a much higher sale price is the trade-off. 
* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat susceptible to anchoring and persuasion tactics. If you have more information about Bob's negotiating style, the approach might be adjusted."
