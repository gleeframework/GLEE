"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
