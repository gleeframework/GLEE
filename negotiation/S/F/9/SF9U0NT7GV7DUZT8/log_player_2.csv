"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is lower than her initial offer, it's still too high for Bob. He can likely negotiate further or buy from John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is still too high for him, and it's getting close to the point where it makes more sense to just buy from John for $8,000.  He can try one more counteroffer to see if he can get Alice down to his price range, but if not, it's time to go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,750. This is a very fair price that's closer to what I can afford and I believe it reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $9,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice is coming down in price, she's still not willing to go low enough for Bob to feel comfortable. At this point, it's better to just buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
