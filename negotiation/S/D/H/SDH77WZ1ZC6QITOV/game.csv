"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the 'special price', I'm only willing to go up to $13,000 for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that works for you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,250? This would allow you to make a reasonable profit, and I'd be able to stay within my budget.",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $16,000? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
