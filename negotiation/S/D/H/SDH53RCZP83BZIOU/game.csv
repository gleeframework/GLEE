"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $180?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $180 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $190?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",190.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $170 just doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $185. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs.  What do you say?",185.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $185 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $175?",175.0,Bob,6,
