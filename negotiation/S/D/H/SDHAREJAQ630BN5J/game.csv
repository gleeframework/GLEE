"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value the product brings to the table.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,075,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,062,500.  That's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both within our desired price ranges. What do you think?",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,062,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
