"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The offer from Alice is still too high. You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your best offer. It's the maximum you're willing to pay.  Alice may reject it, but it establishes your price point early in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your desired price. While it's tempting to accept as it's lower than the initial offer, it's still not within your budget. You can still potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice. If you reject this offer, you can make another counteroffer and keep trying to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you are determined to pay no more than $800,000, it's important to show Alice you are willing to compromise slightly.  $850,000 is a reasonable increase from your initial offer, while still leaving room for Alice to make some profit. This could incentivize her to accept the deal and avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on the price, $1,025,000 is still a significant amount above your desired price.  You have several rounds left, and with each round, you increase your chances of getting a better deal from Alice. By rejecting this offer, you maintain your position of not accepting anything over your maximum limit and put pressure on Alice to make a more favorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by lowering her offer. It's time to raise your counteroffer again, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still staying below your maximum price.  A $900,000 offer represents a significant compromise for Alice, potentially leading to a successful agreement. If she rejects it, you can still consider buying from John as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high for your budget.  You have three rounds left to potentially negotiate a lower price.  By rejecting this offer, you can continue to try to get closer to your desired price.  It's worth noting that buying from John for $800,000 is always an option, so you have some leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and the gap between our prices is shrinking. It's time to make a final push with a substantial counteroffer. $950,000 is significantly closer to your maximum price and represents a strong compromise. If she rejects it, you'll only have two rounds left, making buying from John a more likely outcome. However, this offer shows your commitment to reaching a deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round.  While Alice has continued to lower her price, it's still above your budget.  You have already pushed your offer as far as you're willing to go.  The risk of further negotiation with Alice is that you might not reach an agreement, leaving you with no product.  

Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price. It's the safest and most reliable option at this point."
