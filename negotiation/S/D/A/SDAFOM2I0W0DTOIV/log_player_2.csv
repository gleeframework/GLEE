This is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Alice met Bob's price limit:** She's come down to $1,000,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* **John offers the same price:** While Bob could buy from John, there's no financial advantage at this point.
* **Negotiation risk:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might withdraw her offer or harden her position, leaving Bob with a worse outcome."
