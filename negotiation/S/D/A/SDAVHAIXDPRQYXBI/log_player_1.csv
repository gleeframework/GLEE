Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and represents a great investment for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strategic Justification:**  The message doesn't just throw out a number, it emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is positive and ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation rather than just giving a flat yes or no.

**The Goal:** While the initial offer is ambitious, the strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  See if he's willing to pay a premium.
2. **Maximize Profit:**  Ideally, secure a deal significantly above your minimum.
3. **Secure a Sale:**  If Bob declines, you still have John as a reliable fallback option."
