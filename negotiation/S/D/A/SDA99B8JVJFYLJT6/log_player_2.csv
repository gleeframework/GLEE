{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a slight improvement over her previous offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He has more room to negotiate a better price, and should continue doing so. Buying from John right now would cost him more."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his preferred price, there's still room for negotiation. He's willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $10,000. There's a good chance they can find a price somewhere in between. Buying from John now would cost him more."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, he should still reject it. There is a good chance they can reach a mutually agreeable price with continued negotiation. If they can't find a middle ground, Bob can always opt to buy from John for $15,000. However, there is still room to potentially save money by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is making a final push, increasing his offer to $12,000. This is still below his maximum price, but it demonstrates his seriousness in wanting to reach a deal with Alice. This is likely his final counteroffer, and if Alice rejects it, he will probably opt to buy the product from John."
