"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,075,000? This reflects my product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,075,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a better price. Let's try $950,000. This shows my commitment to this deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be realistic about the value I'm offering. How about $1,025,000? This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",975000.0,Bob,6,
