"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your company.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
