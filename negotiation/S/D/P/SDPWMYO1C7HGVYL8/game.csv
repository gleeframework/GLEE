"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $125, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is getting closer, but it's still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $127.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",127.5,Alice,5,
