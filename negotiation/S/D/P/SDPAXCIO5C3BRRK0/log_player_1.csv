Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a bold opening move that allows room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.  I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer, but I'm willing to negotiate down if needed. I'm also ready to move on to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get more.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to get a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than what John is offering, and I'm confident it's the best deal I can get at this point.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
