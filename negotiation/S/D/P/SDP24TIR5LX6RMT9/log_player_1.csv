Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a higher price than John's offer, giving me the potential for a better profit. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a higher price. If Bob accepts, I make a larger profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John and ensure a decent return. 
* **Potential Value to Bob:**  While I don't know the product's exact value to Bob, there's a chance it's worth more than $1,500,000 to him. By offering a price that's significantly higher than John's offer, I increase the odds of him accepting.

It's a gamble, but with a potential for a significant payoff."
