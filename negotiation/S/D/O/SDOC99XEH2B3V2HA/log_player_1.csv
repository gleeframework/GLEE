"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe its value is significant, and I'm aiming for a price around $1,200,000.  What are your initial thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still potentially secure a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer is as much about understanding Bob's perception of value as it is about setting a concrete price. His response will help determine how aggressively to proceed in future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping the offer to John ($800,000) in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, Alice can always walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both Alice's minimum ($800,000) and his own stated value of the product ($800,000). Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for Alice. 

It's still early in the negotiation, and there's room to negotiate a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer and providing a counteroffer, Alice can try to steer the negotiation towards a more mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is considerably below what I can accept.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 is more reflective of that. This is a smaller step than your initial offer, reflecting my willingness to find a compromise."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice is making a substantial concession from her initial offer ($1,200,000 to $1,000,000), demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Anchoring:** By keeping the price above Bob's initial offer, Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation closer to her desired range. 
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth. 
* **Pressure:** By mentioning it's a smaller step than Bob's, Alice is applying subtle pressure for a more reasonable counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $700,000 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to the middle ground, Alice still has some leverage. 

* **John's Offer:** Alice has the security of selling to John for $800,000. This means there's no pressure to accept an offer below that price.
* **Time:** With several rounds remaining, Alice can afford to continue negotiating. 

It's worth making one more counteroffer, but Alice should be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't significantly increase his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I must be upfront â€“ $700,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for this product. I'm willing to consider $900,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to reach an agreement with you."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Alice is setting a firm boundary by stating $700,000 is not acceptable. However, she softens this by emphasizing fairness and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Midpoint Pressure:**  Offering $900,000 puts the negotiation very close to Alice's walk-away price while still being above the midpoint between the current offers. This applies pressure on Bob to make a more significant move.
* **Time Sensitivity:** While not stated explicitly, implying that this is a significant concession creates a sense of urgency, suggesting time is running out for Bob to secure a deal below $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I can see you're serious about making a deal.  To show you I am too, I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  I think that's a fair compromise at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, his pace is too slow, and he is still significantly below Alice's minimum. 

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's increase from $700,000 to $750,000 is relatively small. This suggests he might be unwilling to reach Alice's minimum price. 
* **Time Value:**  With each round, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob diminish. Alice has a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob. He might never reach Alice's minimum, and she would lose the opportunity to sell to John. 

Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to accept John's offer of $800,000. It's better to secure a sure profit now than to risk ending up with a lower offer or a stalemate after further rounds."
