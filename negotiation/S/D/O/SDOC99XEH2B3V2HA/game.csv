"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe its value is significant, and I'm aiming for a price around $1,200,000.  What are your initial thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is considerably below what I can accept.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 is more reflective of that. This is a smaller step than your initial offer, reflecting my willingness to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I must be upfront â€“ $700,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for this product. I'm willing to consider $900,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to reach an agreement with you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I can see you're serious about making a deal.  To show you I am too, I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  I think that's a fair compromise at this point.",750000.0,Bob,6,
