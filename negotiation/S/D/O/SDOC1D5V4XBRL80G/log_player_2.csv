"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than John's offer, you can likely get it for less.  Let's see if we can negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the product's value and the benefits it offers, I am willing to negotiate at $110. This still represents a premium, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering our previous discussion. Please let me know if this meets your requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate further, $110 is a good price and the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you being forced to buy from John at $100 is too high.  Let's take the deal."
