"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I believe $850,000 is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  This offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, but it demonstrates my willingness to work with you. Let's keep the conversation going.",850000.0,Alice,3,
