"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $110 is within your budget, you can potentially save more by counter-offering.  You know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's offer but still likely within her acceptable range, considering she values the product at $120.  It leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $107 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial price and only slightly higher than what you could get from John. Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, accepting this offer is the best option. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
