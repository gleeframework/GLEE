"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I anchor the negotiation higher. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, suggesting it's worth the high asking price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" signals willingness to negotiate without immediately dropping the price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how eager he is to buy and how flexible he might be on price.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a high benchmark for subsequent negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

I'm willing to negotiate further, but accepting this offer would leave a substantial amount of money on the table. I'm confident I can secure a better deal by strategically countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the value this product brings to the table is truly unique. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's capabilities."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from $2,300,000 to $2,100,000, demonstrating my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm not dropping below the $2,000,000 mark just yet. This keeps me within a reasonable range of my target price while encouraging Bob to make further moves.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message again emphasizes the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake.

The goal here is to signal flexibility while remaining firm on achieving a price that reflects the product's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you're placing on the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,050,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and represents a significant profit. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that:

* **Bob might walk away:** He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but pushing too hard could backfire.
* **Time is valuable:**  Prolonging the negotiation means delaying the sale and potentially losing other opportunities.

Accepting this offer secures a very favorable outcome and allows me to move forward."
