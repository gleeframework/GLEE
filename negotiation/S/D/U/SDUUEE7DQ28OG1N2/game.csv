"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to consider a purchase, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $1100000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly special.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of $750000. It's a fair price for me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $950000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly special.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $950000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at the price I'm comfortable with, which is $800000. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $1000000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly special.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
