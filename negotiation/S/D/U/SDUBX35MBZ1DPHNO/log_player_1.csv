Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm confident that John will purchase the product for $100 if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm not afraid to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than selling to John for $100, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to negotiate a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105, which is still a fair price for both of us and closer to my minimum acceptable value. I believe this offer is compelling enough for Bob to consider, but I'm still willing to accept John's offer if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $90 is getting too low.  Since I know John is willing to pay $100, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
