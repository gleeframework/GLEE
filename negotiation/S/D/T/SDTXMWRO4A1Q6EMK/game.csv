"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and what I'm willing to pay.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair, the product's value is quite high, and $6,000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,4,
