Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need to make at least $100 to consider the sale worthwhile. 
* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so I can aim for a price closer to that.
* **John's backup:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed $100 from John, so I don't want to go too high and risk losing both buyers.

Offering $115 gives me a good chance of selling to Bob, maximizing my profit while also ensuring I get at least my minimum if he declines."
