Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to the price I'm looking for. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500 yet. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go down to $9,800, but that's as low as I can go. This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm not willing to give it away.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is only $300 away from your ideal price.  It's unlikely she'll move much further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal. Accepting at $9,800 is a good compromise."
