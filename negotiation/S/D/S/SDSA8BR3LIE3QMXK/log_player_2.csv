# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000.  This is a fair compromise and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the product's value and my other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's final offer is still higher than your maximum budget.  Even though it's closer, you are better off purchasing from John for a guaranteed price within your budget."
