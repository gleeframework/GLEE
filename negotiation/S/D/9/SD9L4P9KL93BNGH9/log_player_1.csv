"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially offering it to you for $14,500."", ""product_price"": 14500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still achieving a price you'd be happy with.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $14,500, I'm setting a high anchor. This might influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving a substantial gap between my asking price and both Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This allows for several rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($10,000). Accepting this offer would be a significant loss. It's clear we have room to negotiate, so I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I could consider letting it go for $13,000."", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** I'm reiterating that Bob's offer was too low by mentioning ""market value."" This strengthens my position.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down $1,500 from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate but also demonstrating the value of the product.
* **Targeting Above Goal:**  My counteroffer is still $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation while aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his true valuation of the product ($10,000), and his offer of $10,500 is only $500 away from that. However, it's still $1,500 below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from his side before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be realistic about the value.  Would you consider $12,000? This would be my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my best price and I won't go lower.
* **Meeting Minimum:**  I'm now at my absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **Pressure:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm putting a bit of pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Alternative Reminder:** While not explicitly stated, it's implied that I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my desired price."
