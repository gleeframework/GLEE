{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Enthusiastic message:**  A positive message can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not being too aggressive with the pricing, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high allows for the possibility of getting closer to my desired price.
* **Control the negotiation:**  By starting high, I set the tone and control the early stages of the negotiation.
* **Keep the door open to John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer. This will show him that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $9,750? It's a great deal for a product of this quality!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  $9,750 gives me a better chance of getting closer to my target while still showing flexibility.
* **Positive message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  Highlighting the quality of the product as a reason for the price can help justify my stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but higher than Bob's offer. I want to continue to show flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we settle on $9,400?  It's a fair price for both of us and a great opportunity to own this product."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer of $9,750 and Bob's latest offer of $9,200. $9,400 feels like a fair compromise and gives me a better chance of getting closer to my target. 
* **Positive message:** I'm continuing to be positive and emphasizing a win-win situation. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm offering a fair price for both of us to make it more appealing and show a genuine desire to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it's still not high enough to satisfy my goal of getting closer to my initial asking price of $10,000. 

At this point, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob isn't willing to pay much more.  Rather than continue to negotiate with Bob and risk getting stuck at a lower price, I'll take John's offer of $8,000, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. 

This decision prioritizes securing a sale and avoiding the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price."
