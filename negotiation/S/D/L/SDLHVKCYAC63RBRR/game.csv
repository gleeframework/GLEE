"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but hoping to find a price that works a bit better for me. How about we settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. To be honest, $11,000 is as high as I can go. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet your price of $11,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we aim for $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting stuck. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $11,200, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we aim for $11,500, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the extras you're including, but I'm afraid $11,200 is still my limit. I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price, but I understand if you need to consider other options.",11200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $11,200, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, and I'll throw in an additional service to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",11250.0,Alice,9,
