Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we aim for $11,500, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer and the extras you're including, but I'm afraid $11,200 is still my limit. I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price, but I understand if you need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 11200
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, it's clear Alice is trying to get as close to $11,500 as possible.  Bob is sticking to his price, but by reiterating it's his final offer and he's ready to close, he's adding a bit of pressure. It might be enough to get Alice to agree, or she might come back with a final counter offer very close to Bob's limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $11,200, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, and I'll throw in an additional service to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not Bob's ideal price, it's a solid compromise.  She's also adding additional value beyond the original offer.  By accepting, Bob secures a significant discount from John's price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away in the final round."
