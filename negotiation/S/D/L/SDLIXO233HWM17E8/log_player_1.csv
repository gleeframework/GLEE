"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get close to my desired value.  I'm aware that it's likely Bob will counter, but this gives me a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500.  This is a compromise, as I'm coming down from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping he'll see that it's a fair price, considering the product is worth $8,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's a good deal for both of us.  While I could technically sell to John for the same price, there's no point in adding extra steps to the process."
