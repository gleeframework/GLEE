Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,999 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John. This makes her less likely to accept a very low offer from Bob. 

By starting high, but just below Bob's perceived value, Alice maximizes her chances of a profitable sale."
