"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95.  This leaves little room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting the offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You have the option to buy from John for $120, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My counteroffer of $85 is a reasonable starting point, as it's closer to Alice's perceived value of $80 than her initial offer of $95.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate, making it more likely she'll accept.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  I'm aiming to buy from Alice, but I'm prepared to go to John if necessary, which gives me leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, $100 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.
* **Continuing negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to pay more than $85, but not $100. 
* **John's offer is still a fallback:** I can always go to John, so I have time to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm increasing my counteroffer to $90, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Middle ground:** This offer is halfway between my previous counteroffer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $100.
* **Pressure on Alice:** This offer puts pressure on Alice to accept, as she's already moved closer to my position. 
* **Avoiding John:** I still prefer to buy from Alice, but John remains a viable option if this counteroffer is rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price again, $105 is still more than I'm willing to pay. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's a possibility that with continued negotiation, Alice might lower her price further.
* **John's offer is still a fallback:**  I can still purchase from John, so I'm not pressured to accept an offer that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer of $90 and Alice's current offer of $105.
* **Showcasing willingness:** This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and move towards a deal. 
* **Maintaining pressure:** This offer continues to put pressure on Alice to accept, as she's already lowered her price twice.
* **Avoiding John:**  I'm still aiming for a deal with Alice, but I'm ready to go to John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $110 is still above my maximum willingness to pay.
* **Limited negotiation time:** We've had six rounds of negotiation, and we're running out of time.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  While $120 isn't ideal, it's the best available option at this point, as I'm unlikely to get a better deal from Alice within the remaining rounds."
