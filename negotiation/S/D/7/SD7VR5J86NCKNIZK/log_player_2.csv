"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's a good idea to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I am very interested in the product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is my absolute maximum, as I can purchase the same product elsewhere for that price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than Bob's budget, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate. It's worth trying to get the price down further, but remember that Bob can always purchase from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows you to make a profit, while still keeping the price within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $1300000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate further, and her offer is now getting closer to Bob's budget. However, Bob can still purchase from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further in price, and Bob has the advantage knowing he has a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate you coming down in price, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise, allowing you to make a profit while still staying within my budget.  Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm still interested in making a deal with you. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, which is the same price I offered in Round 5. I think this is a fair compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and she's indicating she's unwilling to go lower. While it's possible to continue negotiating, Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's a better strategy to save the time and effort and just buy from John."
