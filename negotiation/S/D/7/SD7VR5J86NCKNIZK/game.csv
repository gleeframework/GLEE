"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I am very interested in the product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is my absolute maximum, as I can purchase the same product elsewhere for that price.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000.  This is a fair compromise that allows you to make a profit, while still keeping the price within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $1300000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and uniqueness.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down in price, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is a fair compromise, allowing you to make a profit while still staying within my budget.  Let's reach a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm still interested in making a deal with you. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, which is the same price I offered in Round 5. I think this is a fair compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
