Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $10,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire it at a lower cost than its true value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $12,000, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale and still earn a significant profit.
* **Attractive Discount:**  Offering the product at $10,000 represents a $2,000 discount from my minimum acceptable price and a $2,000 gain for Bob compared to his perceived value. 
* **Urgency:** By highlighting the ""discounted price"" and ""great opportunity,"" I'm subtly encouraging Bob to act fast. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and ensuring I still get a good return on the product."
