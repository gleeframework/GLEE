Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $125 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $125 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $125 is less than the product's worth to Bob ($150), giving him a potential incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to $150. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $100, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $125. You can likely push for a higher price. You can do this in the next round by making a counteroffer that is closer to your initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach maximizes your potential profit while remaining engaged in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $115 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a good deal for you, considering how much value this product holds. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is getting close to your minimum of $100. While you'd prefer to earn more, accepting this offer is a smart move because:

* **You're guaranteed a profit:**  $110 is more than your minimum, so you'll still make money.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer from Bob or even a rejection, potentially forcing you to sell to John at $100. 
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows you to finalize the sale quickly and move on to other opportunities.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and profitable option in this situation."
