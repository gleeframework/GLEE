"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000? I think that's a fair offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you'd like to pay $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, but I'm not going any lower. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I like that you're willing to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
