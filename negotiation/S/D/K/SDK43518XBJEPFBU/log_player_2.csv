Alice's offer:

Alice is not negotiating in good faith. She rejected my offer of $11,000 and then counteroffered with $13,000, which is a step in the wrong direction. This suggests she's unlikely to come down to a price I find acceptable. It's not worth wasting more time and potentially losing out on the guaranteed price from John."
