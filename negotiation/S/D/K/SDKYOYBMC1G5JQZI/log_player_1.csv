Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. It's a steal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $100 as possible since that's my guaranteed profit with John.
* **Tempt Bob:** Offering the product at $99 is slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly below my minimum. This creates a chance he'll see it as a good deal and accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Optional):**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's still a tiny bit of wiggle room to go down in price if I want to avoid going to John. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit while still aiming to secure a sale with Bob."
