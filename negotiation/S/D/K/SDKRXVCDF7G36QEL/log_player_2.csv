"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even cheaper.  Since you are aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $100 to you, and you know Alice values it at $120, there's room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $85 is a reasonable starting point, offering Alice a profit while still being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's within your budget and offers a better price than John's $100.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
