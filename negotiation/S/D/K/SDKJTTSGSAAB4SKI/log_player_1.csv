Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  A $500 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value allows for potential bargaining. 
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:** It's not an outrageous price that would immediately make Bob walk away.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  By rejecting his offer and counter-offering, you keep the negotiation alive and have a chance to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above your minimum:** You're not settling for less than your absolute minimum. 
* **Shows flexibility:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Keeps the pressure on Bob:** By not accepting his first counteroffer, you've shown that you're not desperate for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to your minimum price, and you've already been through a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and keeps you from risking a deal falling through altogether. It's a good compromise that gets you close to your desired price."
