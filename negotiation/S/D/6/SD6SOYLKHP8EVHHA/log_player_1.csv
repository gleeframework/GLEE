Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value to me. I look forward to your response.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $10,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet because I have a chance to make a slightly better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I still think I can get a bit more. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I'm still hoping to close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,200 is still a little below what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,350? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10350}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $10,300 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable solution for both parties involved. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's only $300 less than my previous counteroffer and is getting closer to my desired price.  It's not worth risking another round and potentially getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for a lower price."
