"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $17,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm happy to offer $13,500.  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $15,000. How about we split the difference at $14,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $14,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,750.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm offering $13,800.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another seller.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I don't want to risk going through another round of negotiations and potentially ending up with an even lower offer.  It's best for me to sell the product to John for the guaranteed price of $15,000."
