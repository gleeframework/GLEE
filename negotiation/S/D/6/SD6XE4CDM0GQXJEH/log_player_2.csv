"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $17,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if we can get to a more acceptable price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $17,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above my ideal price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still leaving some profit margin for Alice. I've also added a friendly message to keep the negotiations amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is a better offer than the initial $17,000, it's still outside my budget.  I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further.  Since we are already in the third round, I don't want to take too long and risk losing the product to another buyer, but I still want to get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm happy to offer $13,500.  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a good deal.  I'm also reiterating my desire to reach a deal to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $15,000. How about we split the difference at $14,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,250 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $14,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,750.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. I'm also focusing on the benefits for both of us, highlighting how this price will lead to a positive outcome. I'm hoping that Alice will recognize the value in reaching a deal and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to get a decent return on my investment.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point. We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to rush into a deal without getting the best possible price. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm offering $13,800.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another seller."", ""product_price"": 13800}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a very slight increase from my previous offer, indicating that I'm nearly at my limit. I've also added a sense of urgency by saying it's my final offer, hoping to motivate Alice to accept. I'm also reminding her of my alternative option of buying from John,  to emphasize that I'm not desperate."
