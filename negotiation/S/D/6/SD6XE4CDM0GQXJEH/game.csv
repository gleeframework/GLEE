"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $17,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm happy to offer $13,500.  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $15,000. How about we split the difference at $14,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can make this deal work.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $14,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,750.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",13750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to get a decent return on my investment.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm offering $13,800.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another seller.",13800.0,Bob,8,
