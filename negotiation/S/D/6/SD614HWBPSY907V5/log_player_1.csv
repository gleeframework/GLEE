Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is guaranteed to pay $1,000,000, Alice wants to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice closer to her $1,000,000 goal.
* **Appeal to Bob's Valuation:** The message highlights the product's value (""significant value"") and exclusivity (""exclusive opportunity"") to make it more enticing for Bob, who values it at $800,000.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of getting the best possible deal from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
