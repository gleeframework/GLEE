"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000. This indicates there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can explore a lower price point that's more favorable to you."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is still within your budget and a good price.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you might end up paying the full $1,500,000 to John.  It's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
