Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 allows a small buffer if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Maintain Attractiveness:** While $120 is Bob's value, offering it at $149 might still be appealing compared to other options or the perceived value of the product.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
