"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm seeking.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
