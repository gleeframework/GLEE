Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is the best possible starting offer. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, he has no incentive to reject the offer right away. It gives me a chance to see if he's interested and potentially negotiate further. If he does reject, I have the option of either counter-offering or moving on to John, which guarantees me $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to both of us.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm seeking.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a good deal considering Bob's initial offer and the fact that selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and secure a significant profit."
