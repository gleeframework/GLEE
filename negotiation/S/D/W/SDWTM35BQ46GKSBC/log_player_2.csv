"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum, there's a lot of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $800,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a more favorable negotiation. If Alice rejects this, it will give me a better understanding of her willingness to compromise, allowing me to refine my offers in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a little, but the offer is still too high.  I need to see if I can push for a lower price closer to my desired range.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to keep the price closer to $900,000. This counteroffer of $750,000 is a slight increase from my previous one, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value. This should help gauge her willingness to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my desired price range, but it's still a little high.  There's room for further negotiation, and I believe I can get a better deal. Rejecting allows me to continue exploring a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to her perceived value of $800,000. My counteroffer matches this value, effectively calling her bluff and showing that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept. If she rejects, I can offer a slightly higher amount in the next round, but I need to be prepared to move on to John if she becomes too inflexible."
