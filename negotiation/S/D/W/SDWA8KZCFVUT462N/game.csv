"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a revised price of $750,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for meeting me closer to the middle. That being said, $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $700,000? That seems like a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
