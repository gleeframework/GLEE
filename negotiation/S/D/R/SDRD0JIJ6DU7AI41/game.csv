"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really not willing to go above $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make a decision today.",850000.0,Bob,6,
