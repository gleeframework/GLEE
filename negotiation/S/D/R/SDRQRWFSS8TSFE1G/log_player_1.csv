{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good starting point. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,000 is not acceptable. I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at a loss. I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John instead of risking further negotiation with Bob."
