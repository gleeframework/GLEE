"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
