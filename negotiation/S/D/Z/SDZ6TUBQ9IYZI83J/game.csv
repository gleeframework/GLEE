"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,001. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.",1200001.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, I'm not comfortable with that starting price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This offer reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price given the value I place on this product. It's a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $1,200,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,280,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
