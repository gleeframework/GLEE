{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $120.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range where a deal might be possible. 
* This sets the negotiation in my favor, forcing Alice to either accept a lower price or risk losing the sale. 
* I'm leaving room for some negotiation, as I'm willing to pay up to $120, but I want to see how far Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price of $120.
* While $130 is closer than her initial offer, I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a lower price.
* I have several rounds left, and I'm not desperate to make a deal right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm now making a counteroffer at my maximum price of $120. 
* This is a clear signal that I'm serious about getting the product but will not go higher.
* If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to buy from John, but I'm hoping she'll accept and finalize the deal."
