"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000). This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize profit. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The $18,000 offer gives me a good buffer, allowing for several rounds of negotiation before reaching my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There is a risk Bob will reject this high offer. However, if I start too low, I might leave money on the table. I'm willing to risk a rejection in the first round to try and get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still leaves room for improvement. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still potential to get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $12,000 would be my last resort, as I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $17,000 represents a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While lower than my initial offer, $17,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value, giving me some leverage.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay closer to my desired price point without completely shutting down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing in:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 away from my initial offer, and is very close to my desired price point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for another counteroffer, there's a risk Bob might get frustrated and walk away. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John at this point would leave $4,000 on the table. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option, maximizing my profit while minimizing risk."
