Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you first at $1,850,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""uniqueness"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, aiming to frame it as an investment rather than a simple purchase.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price significantly higher than my minimum allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $1,000,000.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer provides a safety net. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, I'm not losing out on the $1,000,000.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible profit while acknowledging the potential risks and rewards involved."
