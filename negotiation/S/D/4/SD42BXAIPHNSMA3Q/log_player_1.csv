Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still finding it difficult to meet that price point.  Could you consider $725,000? It's a significant increase from my last offer and would allow me to make this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

We're getting closer, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer from Bob. We're still above John's offer, and I think Bob might be willing to go a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this seems to be a sticking point for us.  $825,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to make my final offer at $760,000.  This represents a fair compromise and demonstrates my serious intent to purchase this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob is clearly set on not going much higher, and calling his offer ""final"" adds pressure.  While $760,000 is a decent price, John's guaranteed $800,000 is the safer and more profitable option at this point. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short."
