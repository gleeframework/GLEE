Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't meet my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering with $14,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves a good profit margin for me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price, $13,500 is a fair price that meets my minimum requirement and secures a sale. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer of $10,000."
