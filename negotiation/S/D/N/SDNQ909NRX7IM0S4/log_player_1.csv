Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Signaling that I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and increases the chances of a successful deal. 
* **Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and hints at a potential benefit for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response (whether he accepts, rejects, or makes a counteroffer) and adapt my strategy accordingly.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh it against my minimum value and the possibility of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 exactly matches my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Upward Negotiation:** Trying to negotiate further risks losing the deal entirely. Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with only the $12,000 offer from John.
* **Time is Money:**  Delaying the sale to continue negotiation could cost me valuable time and potentially lead to other opportunities passing by.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and efficient sale at my minimum acceptable price."
