"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price. However,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
