Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 as a final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
