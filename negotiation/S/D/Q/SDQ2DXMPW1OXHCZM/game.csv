"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your optimism, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000, reflecting the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a price that's mutually beneficial. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $1,000,000 falls significantly short of what I can accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $1,800,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds for your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 remains above my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects a fair price considering the value I see and my budget constraints. Let's find common ground to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 as a final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a mutually beneficial price in this round to finalize the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
