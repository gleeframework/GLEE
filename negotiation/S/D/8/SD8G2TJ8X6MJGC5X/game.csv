"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to me. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,025,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I hope we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
