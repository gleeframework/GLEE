Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession.  How about $110, and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, she's unlikely to go down to $100. You've already reached your maximum price point, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a better outcome.  It's better to secure the product at your target price from John rather than risk paying more with Alice."
