"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] at a price that is significantly below its market value. While I value it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial opportunity for you, and I believe it's a price that aligns with your needs. Please consider this offer carefully, as I have other interested parties who are ready to purchase at the full market price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below market value, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product for $1,000,000, saving him $200,000."
