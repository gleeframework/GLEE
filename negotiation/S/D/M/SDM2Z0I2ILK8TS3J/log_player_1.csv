Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible to maximize her profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above John's Offer:** The offer is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer, ensuring Alice doesn't lose money if Bob rejects it.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a sale above Alice's minimum price."
