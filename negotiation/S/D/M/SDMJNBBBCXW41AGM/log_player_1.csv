"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob sees that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not willing to accept that.  I'm still hoping to get a better price, and selling to John is still a viable option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than what he offered in the last round.  I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John. The negotiation with Bob is getting increasingly difficult and the price is going down rapidly.  I'm not sure if we will reach a deal with Bob in the remaining rounds, and selling to John is a guaranteed outcome that is better than Bob's last offer."
