"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $130?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it at that price.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm still aiming to get a bit more for the product. Would you consider $135?  It's still a good deal for you and would be fair for me.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you want to get a good price, and $135 is closer. I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $132?  It's still a good profit for you and a fair price for me.",132.0,Bob,4,
