Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a good starting point and allows for some give-and-take during the negotiation process.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. I also have the safety net of John's offer of $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not desperate and I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a higher price, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it above Bob's offer.  I'm confident this counteroffer will spark further discussion and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
