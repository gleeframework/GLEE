{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, aiming for a higher price with Bob is worthwhile. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is slightly below my minimum but above Bob's valuation. This creates a sense of a deal for Bob, increasing the chances of him accepting.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested.  

By starting with this offer, I have a chance to earn the maximum possible profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
