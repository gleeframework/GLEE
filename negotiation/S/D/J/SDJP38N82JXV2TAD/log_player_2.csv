# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a step closer to his budget, $1,100,000 is still above his desired price. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."

Bob should buy the product from John for $800,000.  While Alice has come down in price, she's still asking for more than Bob's desired budget.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed price from John and avoid further negotiation."
