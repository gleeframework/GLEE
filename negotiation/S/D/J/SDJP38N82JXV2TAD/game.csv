"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession to work with you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the concession, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which represents a significant compromise for me. This offer reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget. I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
