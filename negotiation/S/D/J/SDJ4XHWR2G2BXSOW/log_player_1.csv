Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Find the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and your minimum ($1,200,000) creates a potential win-win. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin above your guaranteed sale price. 

**Why this approach is better than offering a price closer to $1,200,000:**

* Starting higher might immediately turn Bob away.  By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, you increase the chance of him engaging in negotiation or accepting outright."
