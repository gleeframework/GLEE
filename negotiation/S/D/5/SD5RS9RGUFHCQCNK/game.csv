"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $11,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further,  let's meet in the middle at $11,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
