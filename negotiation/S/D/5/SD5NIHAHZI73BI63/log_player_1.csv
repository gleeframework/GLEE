Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net. This allows Alice to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
