(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal with Alice, but her offer is still too high. I've already made multiple counteroffers, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to my target price. To avoid further rounds of negotiations and potentially losing out on the deal, I'll buy the product from John for $800,000. It's a better option than continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially facing another rejection."
