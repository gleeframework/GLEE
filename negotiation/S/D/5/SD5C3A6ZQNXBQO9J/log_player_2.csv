"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's ample opportunity to explore better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your asking price and the product's value to me. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap between Alice's offer and his own valuation. This shows he's serious about buying the product, but also highlights his desire to save money. The counteroffer is within his budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and a price that still offers you a substantial benefit. Let's close this deal and make it mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $900,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He's still in a good position to negotiate further, given the remaining rounds and his willingness to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. It's worth trying for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's showing flexibility by increasing his offer. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation tactic that signals a desire for a quick and mutually beneficial resolution. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
