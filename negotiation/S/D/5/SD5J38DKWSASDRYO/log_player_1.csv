Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think you'll find it's incredibly valuable, even more so than you might initially realize."", ""product_price"": 170} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""value,"" I'm aiming to shift Bob's focus away from the high initial price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response (acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer) will reveal how eager he is to buy and give me a sense of his negotiation tactics.
2. **Maximize profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the high price, especially if my justification is persuasive. 

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, always keeping in mind my fallback option of selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $120 matches my absolute minimum. While I could accept and get my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to push him a bit higher before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I can't go as low as $120, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $145?"", ""product_price"": 145}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. The ""meeting halfway"" framing makes this concession seem more significant.
* **Maintaining a margin:** $145 is still a reasonable profit margin for me ($25 above my minimum) and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's flexibility. His response will reveal if he's willing to go higher or if $120 is his firm limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer to $130, which is a profit of $10 over my guaranteed sale to John. While I could try to push for a bit more, Bob seems to be anchored around the $120-$130 range. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I risk losing the sale altogether if I push too hard. Accepting $130 secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
