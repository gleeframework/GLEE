"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. $120 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. I can come down a bit to $95. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $85.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we settle on $87.50?  That's a good compromise and would allow us to make a deal.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $87.50 is closer to what I'm looking for. Let's go with $89. This is a fair deal for both of us and ensures I can make a decent profit.  Let's close this!",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down so much. $89 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $88.  That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you say?",88.0,Bob,8,
