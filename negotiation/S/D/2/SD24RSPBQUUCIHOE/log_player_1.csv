Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a high price, but it leaves some room for negotiation and still allows me to potentially make a significant profit.  It's also a price point that is above what I would get from John, so I have a strong incentive to try and reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Selling to John is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and reflects the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping to reach a compromise that allows me to achieve my desired profit while also keeping Bob as a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm confident that I can get my desired price from John.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
