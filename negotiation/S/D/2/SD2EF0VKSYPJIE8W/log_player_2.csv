Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $700,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000 and I can get it for $800,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
