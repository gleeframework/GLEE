"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business, and I believe it's a deal worth considering.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still too wide for me.  To make this work, I'd need to see the price closer to $700,000. Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $700,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,5,
