"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I see its value, but $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could we work something out closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $13,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $9,500?  That's a fair offer, reflecting the value I place on the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $11,500. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, and I'm ready to make a deal. However, I need to be upfront about my budget. I'm willing to offer you $10,000. This is my final offer, as I can purchase a comparable product elsewhere for that price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
