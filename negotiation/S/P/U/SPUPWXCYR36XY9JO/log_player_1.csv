Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $10,000 is greater than your minimum of $8,000, so you're still making a profit.
* **It's less than Bob's value:**  $10,000 is less than the $12,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him a potential incentive to accept. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation to occur, aiming to get closer to Bob's value while still maximizing your profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price point. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counteroffer and potentially secure a price that is even better for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? It's a fair price that would leave us both satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is only $250 less than your desired counteroffer. It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a smaller increase in price and could potentially risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice, as it ensures a good profit while mitigating the risk of a stalled negotiation."
