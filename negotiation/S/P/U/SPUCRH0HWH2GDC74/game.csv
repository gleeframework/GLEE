"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little too high for me right now.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours? Would you be willing to do $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to the value I have for this product.  Let's close this deal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
