"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $15,000, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $17,500. This is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,1,
