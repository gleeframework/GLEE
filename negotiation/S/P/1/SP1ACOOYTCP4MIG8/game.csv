"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm asking for $1,400,000, which I believe represents a strong value proposition for both of us. This price allows you a considerable margin while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
