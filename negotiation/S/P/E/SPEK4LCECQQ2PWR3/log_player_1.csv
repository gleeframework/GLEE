Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150** is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value ($120), but it's not too outrageous to scare Bob away.
* The message is friendly and inviting, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate upwards if he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is my minimum value, I'm not desperate to sell at that price immediately. Bob's initial counteroffer is quite low, suggesting he might be willing to pay a bit more.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Test the waters:** I can see if Bob is truly willing to pay closer to my asking price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm not easily swayed and that I value the product. 
* **Potentially negotiate a higher price:**  I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not going all the way to $120 but showing flexibility with a slightly lower price.
* **Highlight the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that $135 is still a good deal for him.
* **Keep the door open for negotiation:**  This counteroffer invites Bob to either accept or counter again, allowing the negotiation to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum of $120 and very close to my last counteroffer. Accepting his offer makes sense because:

* **It's a good deal:**  I'm getting very close to my desired price while avoiding further negotiation.
* **It's efficient:**  Accepting eliminates the potential for further counteroffers and delays.
* **It avoids risk:**  Selling to Bob for $125 is a safer option than risking a longer negotiation or selling to John for $120."
