"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this great product. I think you'll really like it, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your $80 limit and John offers the product for $80. It makes the most sense to buy from John."
