"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but not too aggressive. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary, but also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum threshold.  While I could accept and sell to him, I'd prefer to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  It's a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for too little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low, but getting closer. I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more by making another counteroffer. I'm hoping that by showing I'm willing to negotiate, we can reach a deal that is satisfactory to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm offering $12,500, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm serious about wanting to close a deal, and hopefully, it will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle.  We're getting close, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
