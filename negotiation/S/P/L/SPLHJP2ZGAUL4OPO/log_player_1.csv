{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $140?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $140. How about $110? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm confident John will pay my minimum.  It's better to ensure a certain profit than risk a lower offer from Bob."
