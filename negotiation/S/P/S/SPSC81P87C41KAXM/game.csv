"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given my needs.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value and my initial asking price.",920000.0,Alice,5,
