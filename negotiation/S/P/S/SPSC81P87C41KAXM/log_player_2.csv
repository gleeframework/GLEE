"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer that is more in line with your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given my needs.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $800,000. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can reach a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While further negotiation is possible, you've already made several counteroffers and Alice has consistently rejected them.  At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $800,000, as it guarantees you'll get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations that may not be successful."
