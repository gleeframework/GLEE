"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than Alice's own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a better deal can be reached."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to his price point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $887,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer of $887,500 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, as she's already made her final offer.  It's better to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
