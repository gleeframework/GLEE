"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $887,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",887500.0,Alice,5,
