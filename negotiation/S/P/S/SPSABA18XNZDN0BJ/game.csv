"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a fair price that still allows you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $925,000. Would that be feasible?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good margin for profit.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
