"Alice, your offer is too high for me. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, I'm only willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer you $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the potential for future collaboration.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  It's the highest I can go at this point. If you're willing to accept it, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
