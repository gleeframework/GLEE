The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This is a significant overpayment. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is comfortable paying. He should continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to his target."

While $1,050,000 is lower than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than Bob's comfort zone. He should reject this offer and counter with a price closer to his target.  There's potential to get a lower price, and Bob should continue negotiating to save as much money as possible."

Bob has been steadily lowering the price, but Alice is being stubborn.  At this point, with Alice's final offer at $1,025,000, Bob is better off buying from John for $800,000.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that the price might not go down further, and Bob would end up paying more than John's price."
