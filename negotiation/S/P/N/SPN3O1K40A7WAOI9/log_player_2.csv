"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe is of exceptional quality and value. Considering its worth to me, I propose a price of $150 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the unique benefits and features that I find valuable. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget. Let me know if you have any questions or need more information about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to you, and John is willing to sell it for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for your maximum value right away from John."
