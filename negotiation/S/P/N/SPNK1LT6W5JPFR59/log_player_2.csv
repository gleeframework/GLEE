"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is a tempting price, you can try to get a better deal since Alice values the product at $80. There's room for negotiation. If you reject the offer, you can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
