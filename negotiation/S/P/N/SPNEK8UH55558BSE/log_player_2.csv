Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to come down to $1280000. This reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is getting closer to your desired price, and you've already rejected a couple of her offers.  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price with more negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially ending up with John's higher price outweighs the potential savings.  At this point, accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price within your budget."
