"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price since Alice values the product at $80. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, which might encourage Alice to lower her price."
