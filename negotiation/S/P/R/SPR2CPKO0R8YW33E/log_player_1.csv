``` 

This offer sets the bar high, giving me room to negotiate downwards if needed. It also emphasizes the value Bob will receive, increasing his incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to me is $1200000. Would you consider lowering the price to match my valuation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my first offer and still a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1225000. This is a fair compromise between our valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is very close to my minimum of $1,200,000.  It's worth accepting this offer, as further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, and I risk losing the deal entirely."
