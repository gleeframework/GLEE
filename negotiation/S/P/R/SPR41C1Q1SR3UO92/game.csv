"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a price significantly lower than its worth to you, and I'll be getting a good price for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $950,000? It's still a great deal for you, and we can get this done.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $875,000. Would you be open to that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $875,000 is still too far below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to get closer to my desired value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $900,000?  I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
