"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we try $90? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great price for a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",100.0,Alice,5,
