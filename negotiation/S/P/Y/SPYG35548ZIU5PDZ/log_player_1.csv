Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial assessment of $80, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $100? It's a fair compromise, and still gives you a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $95? It's the best I can do, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get closer to my ideal price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and come down to $97.50.  This is a very fair compromise, and it shows that I'm serious about selling to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $92 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll see if I can push him higher in the next round, but I'm starting to consider selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $92 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $95. This is my absolute lowest price, and I hope you'll take it. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go up to $90, and that's my final offer. I really want to buy this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  We've gone back and forth with Bob for several rounds, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a price that's satisfactory to both of us.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's the best decision for me at this point."
