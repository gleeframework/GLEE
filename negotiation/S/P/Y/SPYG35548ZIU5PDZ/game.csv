"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $100? It's a fair compromise, and still gives you a good value for the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $95? It's the best I can do, but I'm really interested in the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and come down to $97.50.  This is a very fair compromise, and it shows that I'm serious about selling to you. What do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $92 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $95. This is my absolute lowest price, and I hope you'll take it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go up to $90, and that's my final offer. I really want to buy this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,8,
