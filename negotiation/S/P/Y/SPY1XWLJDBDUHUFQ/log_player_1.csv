Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is a bit higher than your minimum of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, so it's likely he'll be motivated to counteroffer, allowing you to potentially increase the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John for $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's willingness to counteroffer indicates he's interested, and I can try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving a little room for negotiation. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while trying to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $13,200 is only $200 less than my previous counteroffer, and it's significantly higher than what I would get from selling to John. It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
