Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing John provides a fallback at $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's offer ($119) leaves space for potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Create Urgency:**  Phrases like ""limited time"" can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without much back and forth."
