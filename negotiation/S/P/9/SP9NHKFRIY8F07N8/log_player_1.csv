Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise, which is important for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000}
```

I'm moving the price down just a bit, but still keeping it above $1,400,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm hoping for. At this point, I'm worried that we'll be going back and forth for a while, and I don't want to risk losing the deal. I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk getting stuck in a long negotiation with Bob."
