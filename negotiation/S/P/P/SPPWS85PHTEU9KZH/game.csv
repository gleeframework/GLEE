"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me and leaves some room for you to profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, and it's a significant profit for me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
