As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you'll get from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, and it's a significant profit for me. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000. It's the most secure way to ensure I get the product within my budget."
