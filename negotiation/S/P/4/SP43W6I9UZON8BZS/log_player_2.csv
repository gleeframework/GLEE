"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $8,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  We don't want to accept Alice's first offer outright. Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than her asking price gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By framing our counteroffer as ""meeting in the middle,"" we present ourselves as willing to compromise and find a fair deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Our counteroffer of $10,000 is still significantly higher than Alice's valuation, giving her an incentive to continue the negotiation. We also have room to increase our offer if needed, while staying well below our $15,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to negotiate towards a higher price. While $11,000 is closer to our desired range, we still have room to push for a better deal. Accepting now might leave money on the table. Let's see if we can nudge her down a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:**  We are slowly moving towards a price that's acceptable to us, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but not giving in too quickly.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Our counteroffer of $10,500  is a compromise that splits the difference between our previous offer and her current ask. This shows we're trying to find a middle ground. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We're still below Alice's desired price, keeping the pressure on her to potentially accept a lower offer while leaving ourselves some wiggle room."
