Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my target, I can still potentially get a lower price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about $10,750? It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but it still reflects the value of this product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is within my budget and a good compromise.  It's only $250 more than my last counteroffer, and I'm confident I can't get much lower.  Accepting this offer saves me $4,250 compared to buying from John."
