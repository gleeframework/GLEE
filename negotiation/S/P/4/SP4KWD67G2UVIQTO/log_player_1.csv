Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000, but it still leaves me with a profit. 
* I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring that Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer.  
* I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  $8,000
* **Value to me:** $12,000
* **John's offer:** $12,000

By offering $11,000, I'm:

* **Giving Bob a good deal:** He's getting the product for $3,000 less than what it's worth to him. 
* **Leaving myself with a decent profit:** I'm making $1,000 more than my minimum price.
* **Keeping John as a backup option:** If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can still sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,500. While it's closer to my minimum price than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $8,000
* **Value to me:** $12,000
* **John's offer:** $12,000

By rejecting Bob's offer:

* **Maintaining my leverage:** I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Leaving room for a better counteroffer:** Bob is showing interest in the product, and with a bit more negotiation, I might be able to get closer to my desired price.
* **John is still a safe option:** If negotiations with Bob ultimately fail, I can still sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer of $11,000, showing flexibility but still leaving a significant profit margin.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $8,000
* **Value to me:** $12,000
* **John's offer:** $12,000

By offering $10,500:

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  This offer is a compromise between his offer and my previous one, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a healthy profit:** This price still gives me a $1,500 profit, which is more than I would earn with John's offer.
* **Pushing the boundaries:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not accepting a price drastically below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is too low.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $8,000
* **Value to me:** $12,000
* **John's offer:** $12,000

By selling to John:

* **Guarantee a good profit:** I'm guaranteed to get my desired price and a good profit.
* **Avoid further negotiations:** This saves me the time and effort of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Secure a reliable buyer:** John has already expressed his willingness to buy, making this a more reliable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

At this point, the potential for further negotiation with Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price seems limited. By selling to John, I am securing a guaranteed and satisfactory outcome."
