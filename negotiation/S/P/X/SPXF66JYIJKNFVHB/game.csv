"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I do see the value in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to reflect the mutual benefit of this deal. This price still leaves some room for us both to walk away happy. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $925,000 is closer to my bottom line, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $987,500? This would give us both a good deal. ",987500.0,Alice,5,
