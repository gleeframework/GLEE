{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $8,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible without him rejecting the offer.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also ensures a significant profit margin for you."
