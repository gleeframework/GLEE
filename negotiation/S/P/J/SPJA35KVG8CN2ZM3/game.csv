,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $950,000 is a significant step down from my initial ask. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? This represents a considerable discount from my initial price and reflects the value this product brings.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
