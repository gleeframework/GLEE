"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think that's the highest I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low. This product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for this product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? That's a significant price drop from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget now, and I think $12,500 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, so how about $12,750? I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",12750.0,Bob,6,
