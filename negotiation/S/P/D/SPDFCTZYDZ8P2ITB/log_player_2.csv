{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  $950,000 is a good start, but there's likely room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price quickly.  $850,000 is still a good deal for me, but it leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is willing to go lower."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still holding out for a lower price. There are more rounds, and I can still potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $875,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about making a deal but I'm still looking for a lower price.  It's a small increase, so it might be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my limit, I'm still going to try to get a better deal.  It's still a significant amount of money to save, and I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. I'm trying to meet Alice halfway, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still hoping to get a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, and with only 3 rounds left, I'm risking losing a good deal.  While I'd still prefer to get a lower price, $915,000 is a good deal for me, and it's time to close the deal."
