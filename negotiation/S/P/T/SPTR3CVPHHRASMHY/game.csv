"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiating if you're interested.",999000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $999000. I would like to propose an offer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $925000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $925000 is a step in the right direction, I still feel that the product's value doesn't quite justify that price for me. I would like to propose an offer of $875000. I hope this offer will be more in line with what you're considering.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know if this is something you're willing to consider.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $900000. I think this product is worth every penny of that price, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know if you're willing to meet me at $895000.",895000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $890000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know if you're willing to meet me at $897500. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can understand that.",897500.0,Alice,9,
