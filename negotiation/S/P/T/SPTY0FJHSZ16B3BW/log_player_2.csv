"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's target of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's target range:**  $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000 and closer to his desired price of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the risk is that Alice might not budge further or might even increase the price back to $14,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob is limited to 10 rounds, and each rejected offer brings him closer to needing to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
