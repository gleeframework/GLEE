``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($1,200,000), but I'm also willing to negotiate. By starting at $1,000,000, I'm showing Bob I'm open to a deal, while still leaving room to increase the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal by continuing negotiations with Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, the negotiations are taking longer than I'd like. Bob's offer of $920,000 is still lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I don't want to risk further delays and potential counteroffers that might lead to a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and a faster transaction."
