"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This would be a great compromise for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious decision if we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,4,
