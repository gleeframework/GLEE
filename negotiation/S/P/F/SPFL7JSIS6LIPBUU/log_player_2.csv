Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your interest.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to be firm on my price. I can't go any lower than $850,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

Alice is holding firm at a price that's not advantageous for you. It's clear she's unlikely to go below $850,000. You have a guaranteed option with John for $800,000. It makes the most financial sense to cut your losses with Alice and secure the product from John."
