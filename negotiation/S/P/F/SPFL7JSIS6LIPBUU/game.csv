"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your interest.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However,  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $720,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the value of the product.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the  $720,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product and what it can do for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $890,000. This is my final offer.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  While $890,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me. I'm prepared to offer $775,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the limitations of my budget.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to be firm on my price. I can't go any lower than $850,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. ",850000.0,Alice,7,
