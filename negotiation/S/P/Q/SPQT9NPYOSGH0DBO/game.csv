"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you've done your research, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit low for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but $1400000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value to you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but I need you to meet me halfway from there. Can you consider $1450000?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
