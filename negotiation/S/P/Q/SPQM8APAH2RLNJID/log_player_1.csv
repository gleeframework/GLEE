Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 11500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is a tough call, but I'm going to choose to sell to John for $12,000. It's less than what I'd hoped for, but Bob is not budging, and I only have 2 rounds left. I'm not sure I can squeeze much more out of him, and I don't want to risk losing both deals.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
