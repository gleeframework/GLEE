"Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $175 for it.",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $155? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $155, which would be $142.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $142.50 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $145, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested at that price, I'll need to move on to another buyer.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $142, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. Would you be willing to accept that price?",142.0,Bob,6,
