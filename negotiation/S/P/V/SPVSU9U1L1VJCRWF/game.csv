"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  Let's make this deal work.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'm willing to go up to $9,800. Can you meet me there?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,800 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10,000 is my absolute bottom line. If we can agree on that, we can close the deal. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
