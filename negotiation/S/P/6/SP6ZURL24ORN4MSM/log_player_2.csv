"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth $175 and that's the price I'll be offering it at later. However, you can have it for $165. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's story about a higher future price is just a sales tactic. Ignore it.
* You know you can get the product for $150 from John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high and hope she'll come down to a price closer to your target."
