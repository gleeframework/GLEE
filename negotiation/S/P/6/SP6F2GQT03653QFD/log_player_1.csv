Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's perfect for you! I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110} 
 
I'm starting high with the hope that Bob might be willing to pay a premium.  Even if he rejects this initial offer, it gives us room to negotiate and hopefully settle closer to $100. If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I assess Bob's offer. $90 is a decent profit over my minimum. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk he might lower his offer or walk away.
