"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong interest from another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly below her product valuation, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. You can save a considerable amount of money ($350,000) by going with John. Alice's mention of another buyer and a limited-time offer is likely a negotiation tactic."
