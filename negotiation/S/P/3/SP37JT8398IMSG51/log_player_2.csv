"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save $500 by negotiating with Alice. Although Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you working with me.  While this is a good deal, I'm looking to get this product for a little less.  How about $10,750?  This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10750. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is a good compromise and saves Bob $750 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are smaller, and the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John increases. Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
