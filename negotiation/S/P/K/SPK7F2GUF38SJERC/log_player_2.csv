# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for your business, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its significant value, while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
