Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also leaves some room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to progress.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and make a decision based on whether it's closer to my desired price point. If the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory outcome, I'll always have the option of selling to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000. However, it's closer to my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. By doing this, I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price point.  If the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory outcome, I'll always have the option of selling to John for my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this price point will be acceptable to Bob, as it's still a good deal for him considering the value of the product to him is $12,000. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I've already made a compromise and it seems clear Bob is unwilling to go much higher.  At this point, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for my minimum value. It's a guaranteed deal and avoids further negotiation."
