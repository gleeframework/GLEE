Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had from others, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we want to aim higher initially. Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond both Bob's valuation and your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""interest from others,"" we subtly pressure Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counter-offer. This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing your safety net is selling to John for $15,000."
