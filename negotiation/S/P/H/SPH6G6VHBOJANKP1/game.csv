"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000 for the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a limited budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1750000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, I must stick to my budget. I am now offering $1600000 for the product. This feels like a reasonable compromise given the product's value and my financial constraints.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1600000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $1675000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",1675000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm afraid I cannot agree to $1675000. I am now offering $1625000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise, given the product's value and my budget constraints.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
