"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate while also ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $500 below my initial offer, and I'm confident I won't get a better price.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
