"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since you're demonstrating a willingness to walk away.  You have room to counteroffer without exceeding your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% reduction from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates my serious intent to purchase but also establishes a strong negotiating position. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have a better understanding of her bottom line and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my budget, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to pay more than my initial counteroffer, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  The risk of rejecting is that she might walk away, but the potential reward of a lower price justifies the risk at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise. It also leaves room for a potential middle ground if Alice is willing to come down a bit further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is a bit higher than my last counteroffer, but it's still within my budget and getting closer to my desired price. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away. At this point, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal. It's a reasonable price, and I'm comfortable accepting it."
