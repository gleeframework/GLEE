Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price ($145 instead of $150) might entice Bob while still securing a profit. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Starting too high might discourage Bob immediately. A price closer to his perceived value increases the chance of a sale. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
