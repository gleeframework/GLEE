"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire the product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which I believe reflects the value of the product for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would represent a significant saving for you compared to your initial price and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
