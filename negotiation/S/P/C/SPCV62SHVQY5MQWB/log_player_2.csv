"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120.  You can get it for $80 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to pay for the product.  It's a bold move, but I'm hoping Alice will be willing to compromise to make a sale.  If she rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with her or just buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still $5 more than what I can get from John.  It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if I can get her down to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my initial counteroffer of $80.  I'm confident that I can get it for this price, as Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. If she rejects this again, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come down to a price that is below my target of $80. While it's only $1 less, it's still a better deal than buying from John. It's likely that I won't be able to get a lower price, so I'll accept this offer."
