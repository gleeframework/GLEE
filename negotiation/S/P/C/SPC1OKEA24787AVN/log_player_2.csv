Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. While we appreciate your interest in our product, we need to maintain our minimum price to ensure the value proposition remains strong for all our clients.

We believe this still offers a significant saving compared to our initial asking price, while ensuring we receive fair compensation for our valuable asset.
