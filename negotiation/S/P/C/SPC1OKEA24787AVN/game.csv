"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'd be willing to pay $850000 for the product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While we appreciate your interest in our product, we need to maintain our minimum price to ensure the value proposition remains strong for all our clients. In light of this, we are proposing a counteroffer of $900000 for the product. We believe this still offers a significant saving compared to our initial asking price, while ensuring we receive fair compensation for our valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle on $875000? It's a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. We understand your position and would like to meet you closer to our original asking price.
