Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message emphasizes cooperation and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Justification:** I subtly emphasize the product's value to me, hinting at potential losses if the deal doesn't go through. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy.  If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly, but not too much. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, and I'll use it as leverage if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Even though Bob's offer is low, there's still potential for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I'll keep John's offer in mind to use as leverage if negotiations with Bob break down.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer and my original offer, trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to pay a higher price and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This way, we both walk away with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Justification:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. I'm also providing a logical reason for my counteroffer - splitting the difference.
* **Balancing Act:** $1,100,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profit for me. 
* **Remaining Firm:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable value, so there's room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm keeping John's offer as a backup if negotiations fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to determine my next move. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly again, but only if I believe it's necessary to secure the deal.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  I'll continue to negotiate strategically, aiming to secure the highest possible price while ensuring a deal is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting this would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Although Bob has moved closer, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** John's offer remains a valuable safety net, giving me leverage if negotiations with Bob stall.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer and my previous offer. I'll try to find a compromise that is closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'll continue to carefully analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly. The goal is to maximize my profits while ensuring a deal is reached."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $1,062,500 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Next Steps:**

* **End Negotiation:** By selling to John, I avoid further negotiation fatigue and secure a price that meets my minimum acceptable value.
* **Focus on John:** I'll shift my focus to finalizing the deal with John, ensuring a smooth and profitable transaction."
