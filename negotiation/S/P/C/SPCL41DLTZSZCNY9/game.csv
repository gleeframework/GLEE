"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This way, we both walk away with a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal for yourself, and I'm happy to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. Let's split the difference again and aim for $1,075,000. This way, we both get a good price and can move forward. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
