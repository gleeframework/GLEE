"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price for both parties.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is below the minimum I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours? I'd be willing to let it go for $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're getting into a territory where it doesn't make financial sense for me to move much further.  My absolute floor for this product is $1,110,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, as I believe it's more than fair.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
