"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-end item that can bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I can offer $700,000.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
