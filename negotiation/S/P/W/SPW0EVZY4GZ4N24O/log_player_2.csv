"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This price reflects the quality and potential of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob is starting strong by making a significant counteroffer, but it's still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.
* **Shows Value:**  The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product but establishes a clear budget constraint. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Alice to respond and potentially counter with a price closer to Bob's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:**  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Alice is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, suggesting there's still room for further lowering of the price.  Bob can try to bridge the gap with another counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is still an option:**  Bob has the backup option of purchasing from John, so there's no pressure to accept an offer above his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is proposing a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that the proposed price is fair for both parties.
* **Firm but Polite:**  Bob is maintaining his stance on his budget while remaining respectful in his communication."
