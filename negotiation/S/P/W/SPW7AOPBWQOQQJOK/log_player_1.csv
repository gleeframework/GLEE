Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", ""product_price"": 140} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still potentially securing a price closer to your ideal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is $100.  Offering at $140 allows me to gauge his level of interest and flexibility. His response will give me insights into his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Valuation:** Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($120) and his own valuation of the product ($100). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  His offer suggests he's willing to negotiate, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $120.  I'll counter-offer in a way that attempts to move the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your position, but $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you consider $120?  I'm confident it's a fair price for the value you'll get."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've moved significantly closer to Bob's offer to show flexibility, but I'm holding firm at my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value proposition to remind Bob why the product is worth more than his initial offer.
* **Clear and Firm:**  This counter-offer is clear and firm, signaling that while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $120. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While $110 is slightly below my ideal price, it's still a profitable outcome. I'm earning more than Bob values the product for, which is a good negotiating position.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me to sell to John at my minimum price anyway. Accepting now secures a solid profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting a reasonable offer now allows me to move on to other potential deals or tasks."
