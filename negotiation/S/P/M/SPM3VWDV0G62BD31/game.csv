"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $11,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you do $13,000? It's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $12,200, but that's my limit.",12200.0,Bob,4,
