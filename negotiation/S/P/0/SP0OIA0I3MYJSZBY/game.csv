"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to me is at least $800000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $850000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is no more than $1500000.",725000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725000. Considering the product's true value to me is at least $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product is no more than $1500000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $750000, Bob. However, considering the product's true value to me is at least $800000, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $765000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value you place on the product is no more than $1500000.
