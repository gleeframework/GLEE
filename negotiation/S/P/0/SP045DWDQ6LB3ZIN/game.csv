"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While we appreciate your offer, we need to maintain a fair pricing strategy for all potential buyers. We are unable to accept $700,000 for the product. Our next offer for you is $850,000. This still allows us to cover our costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin. We hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  Would you be open to that?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After considering your latest offer, we've decided to counter with $825,000.

We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're trying to be fair, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This feels like a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
