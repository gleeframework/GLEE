""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to the product's worth to him, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm not willing to go as low as $1,500,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet halfway at $2,000,000?"",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is getting very close to his likely maximum price. However, I still believe I can get a bit more out of this deal before resorting to John's offer.  It's a delicate balance at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. What if we settled on $1,950,000? That's a fair offer considering its value."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,850,000 is the best decision at this point to maximize profit. It's a significant amount above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
