"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've suggested. I would like to propose an offer of $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still below what I initially offered. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
