"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider coming down a little further, perhaps to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,500 is tempting, but I have a strict budget. Would you consider $8,000? It's a fair offer considering John is also willing to sell at that price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your point about John's offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,250. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,7,
