"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm unable to accept $1400000. Given the product's unique features and potential, I'm prepared to consider a price closer to $1700000. This would allow for a fair return on my investment while still being a significant value for you. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
