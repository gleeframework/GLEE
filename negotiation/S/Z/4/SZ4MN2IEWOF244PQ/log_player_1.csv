Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

This offer is a compromise between your minimum price of $12,000 and Bob's value of $8,000. It gives Bob a $3,000 discount while still netting you $1,000 more than John's offer. This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a better price than John's offer, while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider."
