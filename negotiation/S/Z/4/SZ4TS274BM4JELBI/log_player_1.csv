Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the immense value it brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure it's worth $950,000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to move forward at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues the product and the transformative impact it can have on your business. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $750,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This recognizes the value it brings while still offering you a considerable return on investment."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still below John's offer, and Bob is incrementally increasing his offers. It seems like there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that recognizes the significant benefits you'll gain from this purchase."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000 again, as I believe it's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has stagnated in his offer and is unwilling to budge above $775,000.  It's clear he's trying to push for a lower price, and we risk losing more potential profit if we continue to negotiate. John's offer of $800,000 is now the safer and more profitable option."
