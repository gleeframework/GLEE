"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and could revolutionize your operations.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure it's worth $950,000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to move forward at this price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues the product and the transformative impact it can have on your business. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $750,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This recognizes the value it brings while still offering you a considerable return on investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that recognizes the significant benefits you'll gain from this purchase.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000 again, as I believe it's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",775000.0,Bob,6,
