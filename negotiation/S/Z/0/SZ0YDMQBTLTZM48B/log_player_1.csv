Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $100 as my initial offer. This is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, making it attractive to him. 
* **Message:** I've included a friendly message that highlights the product's value to Bob. This sets a positive tone and encourages negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** By starting high, I create room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for myself. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $70 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'd like to sell the product, accepting his offer would result in a loss.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** My goal is to earn at least $80. Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling below this threshold.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Backup Option:**  John's offer of $80 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to compromise and offer the product to you for $85. This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while also stating my minimum acceptable price. I'm offering a compromise to show good faith.
* **Price:**  $85 is a middle ground between my minimum of $80 and Bob's offer of $70. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potential Agreement:**  $85 is likely within Bob's acceptable range, considering his initial assessment of $120.
* **Avoiding Loss:** This price ensures I don't sell below my minimum and maintain a profit."
