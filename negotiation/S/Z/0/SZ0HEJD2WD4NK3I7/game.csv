"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This would be a good compromise, allowing you to make a solid profit while giving me a price I'm comfortable with.",875000.0,Bob,4,
