Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant sum to the right buyer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could sell to John for $1,000,000 guaranteed, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  $950,000 is a strong starting point, reflecting the product's high value to both parties. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to strike a balance between:

* **Not leaving money on the table:** We're aiming higher than John's offer.
* **Not scaring Bob away:** We're still offering a price that's significantly lower than the product's value to him, making it an attractive proposition."
