{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's in great condition and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm also being friendly and upfront in my message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I'm going to try to get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $85 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and Bob seems willing to pay it.  I'll accept his offer to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
