Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go below $8,500 anymore, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,900 and $8,500. How about $8,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $8,200 is a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to buy from John for $12,000."
