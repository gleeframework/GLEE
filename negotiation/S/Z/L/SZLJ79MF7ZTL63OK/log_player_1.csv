"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum price, I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000, which reflects a compromise on both our ends.  I believe this price is still fair and represents a significant benefit to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit stretched on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1150000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'll try to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm prepared to make one final compromise and offer the product for $1,225,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and it's a fair price for a product that will undoubtedly be of great value to you.  I believe this is the best we can do to reach an agreement.  Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, as I'm only getting my minimum price. However, with only 4 rounds left, I don't have a lot of leverage. It's better to secure the deal now, as it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer further."
