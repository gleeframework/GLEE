"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me halfway and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you halfway at $9000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you're serious about making a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make a compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $12250?",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12250. I'm still a bit above your previous offer, and I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I'm running low on time to negotiate. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're running low on time, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $11000. I'm willing to make one final offer: $12500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to reconsider my options and may need to look elsewhere. Please let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12500. I've already gone below my minimum price of $12000, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one last offer to you: $13500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,9,
