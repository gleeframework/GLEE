"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $10,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, you know you have an alternative seller (John) willing to sell it for $12,000. This gives you bargaining power. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might incentivize her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
