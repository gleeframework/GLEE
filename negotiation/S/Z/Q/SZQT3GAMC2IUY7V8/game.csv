"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. Would you consider selling the product to me for $950,000? I'm hoping this price aligns better with what I perceive the product's worth to be.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. It's important for me to get a fair price for this unique item. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I believe this price is still attractive to you and allows me to achieve my desired outcome. Let's work together to make this happen.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
