"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $11,500. This is a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob, as it's below his perceived value of $12,000. This leaves room for potential negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet willing to settle. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum. I believe this counteroffer is still attractive to Bob considering his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and getting closer to my ideal price. I'll accept this offer to secure the sale."
