Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $75.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $82?  It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $78 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $78 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  It's a fair price for both of us and will allow me to move forward."", ""product_price"": 80}
