(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle on $62? That's a fair price."",

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me halfway, and $63 is a good deal, saving me $17. It's not worth risking John's offer for another couple of dollars in this situation."
