Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm not too aggressive because I want to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, so it's best to accept and avoid further negotiations."
