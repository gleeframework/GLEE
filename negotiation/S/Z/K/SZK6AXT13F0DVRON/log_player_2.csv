"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $9500.  It's worth a lot more than that to you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable investment.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but it's still above your ideal price point.** You are willing to pay up to $10,000, but would prefer to pay less. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price.** Even if you end up buying from John, rejecting Alice's offer might make her reconsider her price and come back with a better offer."
