"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase it and you to secure a sale close to your desired price. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This would still leave a profit for me and allow you to acquire the product at a reasonable price.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,650,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,625,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and allow us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
