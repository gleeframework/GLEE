Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,600,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high demand and value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves a degree of risk. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for your guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price makes it a calculated risk worth considering."
