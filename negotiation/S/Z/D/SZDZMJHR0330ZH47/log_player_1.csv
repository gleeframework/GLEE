Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategic offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I open it up to other interested parties. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other buyers eager to proceed."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, knowing John provides a safety net.
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" entices Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,350,000 is:
    * Significantly above Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, giving us room to negotiate.
    * Still attractive enough compared to his alternatives, especially if he highly values the product. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other buyers"" creates urgency for Bob to decide.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Bob's response might require adjusting the price slightly in further negotiations."
