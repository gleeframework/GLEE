"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the product's value, $1,200,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, reflecting the maximum I can reasonably spend.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is an option, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is considerably below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Show Flexibility:** I've lowered my price by $100,000 to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** My new offer is still significantly above Bob's valuation and closer to my minimum. This signals that I'm serious but open to a reasonable deal.
* **Keep John as Backup:** I haven't accepted John's offer yet, as there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to maximize your return, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is increasing his offers, indicating a willingness to meet closer to my price range.
* **Potential Upside:** While $900,000 is still below my target, I believe I can negotiate a higher price with six rounds remaining.  
* **John Remains an Option:** I'm not accepting John's offer yet, as the negotiations with Bob are progressing, and there's potential for a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm lowering my price by $50,000, demonstrating movement and a genuine desire to close the deal.
* **Holding Firm:** I'm still above $1,000,000, emphasizing the product's worth and my bottom line.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, this offer encourages Bob to make a serious move toward a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'm firm on $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's increases are getting smaller, suggesting he's reaching his maximum price.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer nets $950,000. Continuing carries the risk of him walking away, leaving me with a lower offer or potentially nothing. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer ensures a $1,000,000 profit, a more certain and ultimately better outcome.

While I might squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the potential gains aren't worth the risk of losing a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
