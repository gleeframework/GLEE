"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I recognize the product's value, $1,200,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, reflecting the maximum I can reasonably spend.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is considerably below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to maximize your return, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm firm on $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
