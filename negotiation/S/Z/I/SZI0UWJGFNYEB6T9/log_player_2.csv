"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  You have significant room to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a much lower offer accomplishes two things:

1. **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counter-offer helps you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate and how far apart your valuations truly are.
2. **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives you space to gradually increase your offer while staying well below your $1,000,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still above your maximum price and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  You're now at your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely you'll find a better deal elsewhere.
* **Transparency:**  By being clear about your limit, you signal seriousness to Alice without revealing your other option (John).
* **Pressure:**  This puts some pressure on Alice.  She can either accept your offer or risk losing the sale entirely."
