"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. While it's a good starting point, Bob can try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. Considering your willingness to pay $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. Considering your willingness to pay $1,100,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,120,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still recognizing the product's value. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,120,000, this is still above Bob's comfort zone.  Since he has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense for Bob to take that option and save the additional $120,000.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing a deal that is already within Bob's budget."
