"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your initial offer, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  Considering the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreeable deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. Considering your willingness to pay $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To move forward, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. Considering your willingness to pay $1,100,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,120,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still recognizing the product's value. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
