"Alice,  $15000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however. I'll offer you the product for $12000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this amazing product.  Let's find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $10000.  It's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
