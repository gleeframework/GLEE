"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $15000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however. I'll offer you the product for $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this amazing product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $10000.  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as what I can get from John.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
