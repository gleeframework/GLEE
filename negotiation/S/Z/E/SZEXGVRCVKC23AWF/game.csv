"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $11000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer it to you for $12800. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer it to you for $12200. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to propose a price of $11000, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it if you can meet me there. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it carefully.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a serious commitment, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer it to you for $11800. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm willing to make a serious commitment, and I've been willing to meet you in the middle multiple times. I'm not willing to go any higher than $11500, and I'm starting to think that this negotiation is going nowhere. If you're not willing to meet me at $11500, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying the product from John for $12000.",11500.0,Bob,10,
