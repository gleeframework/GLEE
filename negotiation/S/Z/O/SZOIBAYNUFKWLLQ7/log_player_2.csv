"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a great price. I'm asking $110 for it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is asking for $110.
* **You save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $40 compared to buying from John. 

Even though you could potentially get a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate with John, there's no guarantee that will happen. It's better to secure a good deal with Alice."
