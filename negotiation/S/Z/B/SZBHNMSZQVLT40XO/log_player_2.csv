"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and would greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds remaining to potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. Bob is aiming to start the negotiation process aggressively to get closer to his desired price.
* **Reasonable Justification:** Bob provides a justification for his offer, highlighting the potential profit for Alice and framing it as a win-win situation.
* **Focus on Value:** Bob emphasizes that his offer is still significantly above Alice's valuation, underscoring the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for what this product offers.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,110,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Bob has 7 rounds remaining to potentially negotiate a lower price.  He can continue to counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his target. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While buying from John is an option, Bob is taking a calculated risk by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance he could get a better deal.

**Next Steps:** Bob should continue to counteroffer with a price closer to his target value, but not going so low that Alice is likely to walk away from the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference - $1,080,000.  This still gives you a good profit, and it's getting us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This counteroffer takes the average of Bob's previous offer ($1,050,000) and Alice's offer ($1,110,000). It demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, which can increase the likelihood of Alice accepting. 
* **Emphasis on Profit:**  Bob again emphasizes that the offer still provides a good profit for Alice, highlighting the potential win-win nature of the deal. 
* **Closer to a Deal:**  By showing a willingness to compromise, Bob is signaling that he is serious about closing a deal. This can put pressure on Alice to accept."
