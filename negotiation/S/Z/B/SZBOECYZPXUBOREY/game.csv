"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Would you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which would be a fair price for both of us. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, but if you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to make a smart financial decision. Would you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,6,
