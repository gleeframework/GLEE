{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm being polite and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm offering a justification for the price to make it seem reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects, I'll consider:

* **Lowering the price slightly:** If he's close, I might lower it to $9,500 to see if we can close the deal.
* **Counteroffering aggressively:** If he's very low, I might counteroffer closer to my minimum price of $12,000 to gauge his seriousness. 
* **Exiting the negotiation:**  If it seems like we're too far apart, I'll move on to selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, he's expressed interest. This indicates there's room for negotiation and a possible compromise.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob break down completely.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. I might start with $10,500 and explain that this is a fair price considering the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Bob's offer ($8,000) and my previous offer ($10,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll consider:

* **Further Compromise:**  I might lower the price slightly to $10,000, but I'll try to stick to my minimum of $12,000 as much as possible.
* **Exiting the Negotiation:**  If Bob continues to push for a price significantly lower than my minimum, I'll likely exit the negotiation and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's closer, accepting it would still be a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiations are moving in the right direction:** Bob's offers are steadily increasing, which indicates he's getting closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John is a safe backup:** I can still sell to John for $12,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly closer to his offer, but still higher than my minimum. I might suggest $10,000 or $9,500. I'll continue to highlight the value of the product and emphasize that I'm willing to negotiate but need to ensure a fair price for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.

This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise by dropping my price slightly from $10,500 to $9,500. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price and encourage him to consider the long-term benefits of acquiring it.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive and productive.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider:

* **Final Compromise:** I might lower the price to $9,250, but I'll be hesitant to go any lower.
* **Exiting Negotiation:** If Bob continues to push for a price significantly lower than my minimum, I'll likely exit the negotiation and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, but if you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to make a smart financial decision. Would you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is indicating his willingness to pay $9,000, which is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. 
* **John's offer is more profitable:**  Selling to John for $12,000 will net me a significant profit.
* **Risk of losing the deal completely:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might actually buy from John, which would mean I wouldn't sell the product at all.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
