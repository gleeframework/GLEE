Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully create a positive environment for negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard limit or making it seem like this is the only price I'll accept.  This encourages Bob to engage in a negotiation rather than just rejecting the offer outright. 

**Strategy:** I'm hoping that Bob will either accept my offer or counter with a price closer to $150.  If his counteroffer is too low, I can always reject it and try to get closer to my desired price. If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $120 is closer to my minimum price of $100, but it's still not ideal.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $100 would be a loss compared to what Bob is offering. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a bit from my initial price, how about $140?  That's still a good value considering the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price from $150 to $140.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the quality of the product to justify the price.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  I'm not going all the way down to Bob's offer of $120, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping that Bob will either accept my counteroffer or come up slightly from his previous offer. If his counteroffer is still too low, I can reject it again and try to get closer to $140."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $10 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I continue to reject offers, I risk Bob walking away entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $100 would mean leaving $30 on the table.

**Strategy:**  It's best to accept Bob's offer at this point. It's a good compromise, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing the deal altogether."
