Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be extremely valuable for you, for $11,000."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.

Offering the product at $11,000 creates a win-win scenario:

* **Bob's Gain:** Bob gets the product for $1,000 less than his perceived value, a significant saving.
* **Your Gain:** You maximize your profit by selling it for $3,000 above your minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
