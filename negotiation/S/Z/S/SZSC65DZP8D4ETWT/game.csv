"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and I believe my initial price is closer to reflecting that. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value to me, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be fair to both of us, I can't go any lower than $1,250,000. This is a final offer, as I have other interested parties.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have other interested parties, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go a bit higher from my previous offer, so how about $1,150,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I have to be upfront with you.  John has been very persistent and is ready to close the deal at my minimum price. I'd prefer to work with you, but not at any cost. If you're unable to meet my final offer of $1,250,000, I'll have to move forward with John.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that John is waiting in the wings, but I'm still willing to work with you. However, I need to get a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please reconsider.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
