"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better by rejecting her offer.  Here's why:

* **Your goal is to save money:** You are willing to spend up to $1,000,000.  
* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price:** Even at $925,000, you're paying more than you would like.
* **Negotiation potential:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you are willing to walk away. This could lead Alice to lower her price in order to secure the sale.

By rejecting, you open the possibility of further negotiation with Alice or potentially finding a better deal elsewhere."
