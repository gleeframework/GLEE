"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $120, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $92. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $92 is closer to Bob's initial offer, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($80) and leaves room for further negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $92 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $88. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's make this deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $88. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $95. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $95 is still within Bob's budget of $120, and while it's not ideal, it's a good compromise. Rejecting this offer risks further negotiation that might not lead to a lower price. Additionally, buying from John at $120 is significantly more expensive. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this scenario."
