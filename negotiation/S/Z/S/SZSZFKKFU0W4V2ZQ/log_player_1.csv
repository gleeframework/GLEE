Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This price allows for potential compromise and still nets me a significant profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer lets me gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 in mind. If Bob doesn't bite, I'll know I can fall back on John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for.  
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, which gives me strong negotiating leverage with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to close the gap and secure a better price. 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the value of this product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  $875,000 is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer, which increases the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still above his initial price, reminding him that I have alternatives (selling to John).
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer might be my last one before I consider selling to John. I'm trying to secure a price that's acceptable while maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original budget. I propose to purchase the product for $850,000. This is the maximum amount I can afford without exceeding my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is firm on his $850,000 offer, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a profit of $1,000,000, which is higher than what I can reasonably expect from Bob. 

It's time to secure the guaranteed deal with John and maximize my profit."
