# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to me, at least $10000. I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $15000.  It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable addition to your collection. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, and I'm proposing $13500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for this product. Let me know your thoughts.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to your target, you can still potentially get a better deal.  You know John will sell you the product for $12,000, so you have a solid baseline for your counteroffer."
