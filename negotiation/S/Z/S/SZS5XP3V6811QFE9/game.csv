"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to me, at least $10000. I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $15000.  It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable addition to your collection. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, and I'm proposing $13500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for this product. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $12500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it's the highest I'm able to go.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
