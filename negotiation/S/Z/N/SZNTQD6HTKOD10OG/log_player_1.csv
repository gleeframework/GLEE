Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing John provides a safety net.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly below Alice's minimum ($12,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, there might be a small window for Bob to negotiate, still landing Alice above her minimum. 
* **Limited-Time Offer:**  This encourages Bob to act quickly and not undervalue the product."
