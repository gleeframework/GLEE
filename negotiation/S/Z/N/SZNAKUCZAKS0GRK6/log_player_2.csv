"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product that I know will be highly valuable to your business.  I'm confident it will be worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a price that's fair to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
