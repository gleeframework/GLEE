Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price, and Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum. I'll try to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,300,000.  This is a very fair price, considering the value this product holds. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I really think $1200000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'd like to keep negotiating, I've reached the point where Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's best to secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation failing."
