"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $140. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. You can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
