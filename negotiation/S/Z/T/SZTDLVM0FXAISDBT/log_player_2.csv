This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice is offering the product for $13,500, which is less than John's price of $15,000. 
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice's offer.**  Even though Bob is getting a good deal, he still values the product at $15,000, meaning he is willing to pay up to that amount. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money and still get the product."
