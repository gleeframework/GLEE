"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and provides a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you, I propose a price of $1,100,000. This still represents a premium over the market rate but is more in line with your budget. Please let me know if this revised offer suits your needs.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This represents a significant investment for me and is a fair price based on the value I see in your product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price for the product. In light of your latest proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $1,085,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it also reflects the unique value and quality of the product. I hope this revised offer will be acceptable to you.",1085000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,085,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,070,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to move further towards your offer.  Let's close this deal.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
