"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I can't justify going as high as $1,600,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  That's a significant offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
