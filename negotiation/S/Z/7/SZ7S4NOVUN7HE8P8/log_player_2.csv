"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is well above my budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit of $10,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $13,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay more than $10,000. I'm confident that I can continue negotiating with Alice to get a lower price or simply buy from John at my preferred price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $13,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer to try to reach an agreement. I'll come down to $14,500, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is still too high for me. While we've made some progress in negotiation, I'm getting close to the end of my rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not comfortable with.  It's more prudent to buy the product from John at my desired price point of $10,000."
