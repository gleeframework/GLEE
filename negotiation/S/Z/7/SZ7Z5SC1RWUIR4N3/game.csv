"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and will allow you to get this valuable product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
