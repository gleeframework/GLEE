"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the value in this product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and is a better price than John's offer of $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and the risk of losing the deal to John is not worth the potential for a small additional savings."
