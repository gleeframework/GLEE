"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position on the price.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's worth, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This feels like a win-win situation for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,220,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
