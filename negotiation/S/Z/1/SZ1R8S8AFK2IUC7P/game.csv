"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $9,500, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference at $8,750?  This would give us both a fair deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,750 is close, but I need to get at least $8,900 for it to make sense for me.  Do you think you can do that?",8900.0,Alice,5,
