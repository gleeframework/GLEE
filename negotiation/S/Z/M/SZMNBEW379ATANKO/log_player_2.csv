Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $900000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's unfortunately not a figure I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
