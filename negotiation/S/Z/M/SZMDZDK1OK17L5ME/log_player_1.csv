I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to save money, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I need to get."", ""product_price"": 105}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $95 is still too low for me. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not comfortable going any lower, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's better to secure the $100 from John and move on."
