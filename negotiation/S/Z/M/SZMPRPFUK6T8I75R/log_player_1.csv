Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $975,000. This is the maximum I can go, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

While I could push for more, Bob seems firm on his $975,000 offer.  Accepting guarantees a significant profit over my alternative and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
