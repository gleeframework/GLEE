"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a slight concession, it's still higher than what Bob is comfortable with.  There's still room to negotiate a better price.  Bob should continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $92.50 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and go with $88.75?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 88.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a bit more for the product. I'm willing to go up to $91, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only willing to go down to $91, which is very close to her original offer.  It's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a price below $90.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $120, as this is still within his budget, and it avoids the risk of Alice rejecting any further counteroffers."
