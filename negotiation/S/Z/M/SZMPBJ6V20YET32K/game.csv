,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $92.50 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and go with $88.75?  That way, we both get a good deal.",88.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a bit more for the product. I'm willing to go up to $91, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",91.0,Alice,5,
