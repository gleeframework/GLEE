"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for potential negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $120.  I'm curious to see Bob's reaction and will adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to sell for a ridiculously low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $115.  This is a significant drop, but it's getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this signals that I'm serious about making a deal and that I'm willing to compromise. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a middle ground."
