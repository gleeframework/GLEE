"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a significant price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,050,000. This is a compromise, but still a significant amount that reflects the product's value. I believe Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I think I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but I still believe the product's value justifies this price. I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With Bob's offer at $850,000, I'm not confident I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds.  It's getting risky to continue negotiations, and John's offer of $800,000 is a guaranteed sale.  It's time to take the sure thing."
