"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a fair compromise for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made a significant concession by going from $12,000 to $11,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting a bit drawn out.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be budget-conscious.  My absolute final offer is $10,500. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
