Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still far below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm hoping for a better deal,  I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation and possibly ending up with a lower price. It's time to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
