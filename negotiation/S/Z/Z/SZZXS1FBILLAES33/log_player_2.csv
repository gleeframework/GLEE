"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point. This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, but still saves Bob a significant amount compared to the original offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is still less than Bob's maximum budget, it's not a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to his desired range. He still has room to negotiate without reaching his limit of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown a willingness to pay more than $9,000, and Alice has countered with $10,500. This counteroffer of $9,500 represents a compromise, showing that Bob is serious about buying the product but also trying to get a better price. It's a reasonable midpoint between the two previous offers, and it keeps Bob within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still not a good deal for Bob. He can still try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down a little more. It's unlikely Alice will offer a price below $10,000, so Bob has a good understanding of where the negotiation might be heading.  If the next offer is still too high, Bob can consider buying from John for $12,000, as that is his absolute limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final attempt to get the price down to a level he's comfortable with. He's already shown his willingness to go up to $9,500. This counteroffer of $10,000 is a clear signal that he's willing to pay a little more but is nearing his limit. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely choose to buy the product from John for $12,000 rather than continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is only $500 away from Bob's absolute limit of $12,000. It's unlikely that Alice will offer a lower price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the product to another buyer.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at $12,000, as it avoids further negotiation and ensures he gets the product within his budget."
