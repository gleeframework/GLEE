"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1500000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is my best and final offer for now. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1100000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle of my previous offer and your current offer. How about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. How about we meet at $1280000? This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to throw in some additional perks, but I'm still not convinced that $1280000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I need you to throw in some more perks to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $1250000, and you throw in a free warranty and some additional training on how to use the product?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to throw in the free warranty and additional training as you requested, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1260000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1260000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to throw in the warranty and training, but I'm still not convinced that $1260000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1240000, and I'd like to request that you throw in a 6-month maintenance contract in addition to the warranty and training. If you're willing to do that, I might be willing to consider your offer.",1240000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to throw in the warranty, training, and 6-month maintenance contract as you requested, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1240000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but only if you're willing to commit to a 2-year maintenance contract. This will give me the assurance that I'll be able to provide you with the support you need for the long-term use of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to throw in the additional perks, but I'm still not comfortable committing to a 2-year maintenance contract. I'm willing to meet you at $1220000, but I'd like to propose a 1-year maintenance contract instead. If you're willing to accept this, I'll consider your offer. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1220000.0,Bob,10,
