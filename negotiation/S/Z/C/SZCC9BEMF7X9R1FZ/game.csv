"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, but I'm not going any lower than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer: $1050000 is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. Let me know if you're willing to make a decision.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
