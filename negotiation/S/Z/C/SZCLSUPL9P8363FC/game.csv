"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
