"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a great starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation.  Since I want to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price, but I still think I can get it for a bit lower.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer will give me a better chance of saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my target price of $1,000,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer or running out of rounds is high.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product, especially considering the alternative is to buy from John at $1,500,000."
