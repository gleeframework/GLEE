{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer sets a price that is lower than Bob's perceived value ($100) but still provides me with a good profit margin. It also opens the door for negotiation, which is essential to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product and think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? I think that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within my minimum acceptable range. Although it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $80.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
