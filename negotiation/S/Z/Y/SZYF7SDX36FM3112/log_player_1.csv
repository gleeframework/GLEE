Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000. "", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position, allowing her to be more assertive in her pricing with Bob."
