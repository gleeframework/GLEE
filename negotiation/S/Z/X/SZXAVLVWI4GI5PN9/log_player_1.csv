"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm mentioning the value of the product to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Asking for feedback:** I'm prompting Bob to engage in a discussion, setting the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  John's offer is a safety net, but I'm not desperate to accept it yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Compromise:** I'm presenting my counteroffer as a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value reminder:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is what it's worth to me. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to push further:** It's unlikely I can get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and delaying the sale.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John if this deal falls through."
