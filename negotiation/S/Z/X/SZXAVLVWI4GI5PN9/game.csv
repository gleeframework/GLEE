"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is what it's worth to me. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
