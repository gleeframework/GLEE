"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value for either of us. To be realistic, I can't go lower than $1,450,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does a fair deal. I can go up to $900,000, but that's my limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,
