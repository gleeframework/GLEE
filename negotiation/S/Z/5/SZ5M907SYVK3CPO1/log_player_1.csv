"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm asking for $140, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profits, so I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value of the product. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone can help keep Bob engaged and willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $140 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial price within the 10 rounds. 
* **John as a safety net:** I'm aware of John's offer as a backup, so I'm not afraid to be firm if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $140 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  I have 8 rounds remaining and there's still room to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While $120 from John is tempting, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within reason:**  $130 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still being above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the product's value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value can justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for further discussion and potential compromise in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a solid offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $120 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm comfortable selling at this point.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While there's potential to get a higher price, there's also the risk of Bob becoming less willing to negotiate further.
* **Time constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's prudent to accept a fair offer.
* **No significant advantage over John's offer:**  At this point, Bob's offer doesn't provide a significant advantage over John's offer."
