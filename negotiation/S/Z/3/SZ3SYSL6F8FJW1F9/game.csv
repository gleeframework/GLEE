"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price is still well within the value you place on the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000, which is $1,112,500. Can we meet at this price?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
