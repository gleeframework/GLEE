"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $950,000 for it. Would you consider that price?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we possibly settle at $900,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get at least $925,000 for the product. Would you consider that price?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
