Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:**  $950,000 is still lower than the $1,000,000 value Bob places on the product, making it potentially attractive to him.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your potential profit:** You're starting high to see if you can get closer to the $1,000,000 value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  A counteroffer from Bob is likely, and you can then adjust your price accordingly.
* **Have a fallback option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you can always sell to John for $800,000, ensuring you don't lose out entirely."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation to potentially earn a higher price. You're in a strong position with a higher fallback option with John, so rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that's mutually beneficial. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value you place on this product and it still allows me to achieve my desired outcome."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm also open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $875,000 isn't the ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, it's likely he won't budge much further.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal."
