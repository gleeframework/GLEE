"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my original offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. This would still give you a good profit, and allows me to get closer to my target value. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll pay $1050000, but only if you're willing to come down to $1000000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
