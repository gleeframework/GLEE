"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to settle for that low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this deal work.  It's still a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to give up the product for less than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob is getting closer with his offers, but I'm starting to feel like he's just trying to lowball me.  While I'd rather make a bit more, it's getting to be a lot of effort to negotiate and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal. John is a sure thing and I'm happy with that."
