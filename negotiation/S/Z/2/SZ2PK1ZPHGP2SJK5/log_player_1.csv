Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $12,000 (the minimum you'll accept)
* **Bob's Value:** $10,000 (the maximum he's willing to pay)
* **John's Offer:** A guaranteed $12,000

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price, you have leverage.  You don't need to go below $12,000. However, there's a chance to get a slightly higher price from Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm asking for $12,500. Let me know your decision quickly as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** By mentioning other interested parties, you create a sense of scarcity and urgency.
* **Slight Markup:** The $12,500 price leaves some room for negotiation but keeps you above your reservation price.
* **Time Pressure:** Encouraging a quick decision prevents Bob from overthinking or trying to lowball you.

**Important Note:**  While you have a strong position, there's no guarantee Bob will accept $12,500. He might counter-offer, or you may need to negotiate slightly if you want to secure the deal with him."
