{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better price.  I'm also setting a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum threshold, I'm going to reject it. I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 85}
