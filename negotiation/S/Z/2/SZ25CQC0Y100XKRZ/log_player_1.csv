{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leverage the fact that he's interested. It also shows I'm open to negotiation, which might encourage him to counteroffer rather than walk away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $150. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy to sell for $150, I'm going to try to get a little more.  Bob has already shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget.  How about $160? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to come down a little from my original price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still trying to get a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Could we possibly settle at $155? This would allow us to reach a compromise while keeping the price within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John would pay, and only $5 less than my initial offer.  It's time to accept and secure the sale."
