"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product that I know is worth a great deal to you.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's start with a price of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point of $1,000,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy from John, knowing that he can still get the product within his budget."
