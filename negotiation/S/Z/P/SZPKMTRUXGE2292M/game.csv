"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, however.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen - how about $1,275,000?  That's my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
