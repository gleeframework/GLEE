Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum value. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your final offer of $12500. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he values the product at no more than $12,000. Alice's final offer of $14,000 is still too high.  It's better for Bob to buy from John for $12,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
