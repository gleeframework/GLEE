Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price that allows me to earn a significant profit while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it is significantly lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob with $90. This is still a good deal for him, considering he values the product at $100. By meeting him halfway, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered the maximum I am willing to go down to, and I'm not convinced he will go higher. While I would prefer $90, accepting his offer ensures a profit and prevents further negotiation."
