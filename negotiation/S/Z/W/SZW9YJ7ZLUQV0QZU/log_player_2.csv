"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* You can get the product for a lower price from John ($1,000,000).

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John and save $75,000."
