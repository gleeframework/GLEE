{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  I believe it holds significant value for your specific needs. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit over Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to my guaranteed sale price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers (even without naming John) introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
 
This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, allowing me to potentially secure a deal above $1,200,000."
