"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to reflect your willingness to negotiate.  This price is still fair, considering the value of the product. Let's keep working towards a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
