"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95.  It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best not to accept the first offer. There's room for negotiation, and even if it doesn't go well, you can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The tone is important.  Being polite and expressing interest while still countering firmly helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give us a sense of how flexible Alice might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but I can't go that low. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice moved down from $95 to $85, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** We're still above our target price, so it's worth pushing a bit further before accepting.
* **Deadline Not Urgent:** We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was probably too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between your initial offer and Alice's counteroffer. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** By moving closer to her price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Staying Below Target:**  This offer keeps you under your $80 limit, ensuring you still get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  $82 is my final offer.  It's a great deal for a product you value at $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $82 is very close to Alice's value of $80 for the product, making it unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** While not always genuine, Alice using the phrase ""final offer"" suggests she's getting close to her limit. 
* **Saving Money:**  This price is still a significant saving compared to buying from John at $100.

It's usually better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing it by pushing too hard."
