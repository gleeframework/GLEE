"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's important to start negotiating and see if we can get a better price.  Buying from John for $800,000 is always an option, but let's see if we can get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price. I'm aiming to get it closer to $800,000 and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $825,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
