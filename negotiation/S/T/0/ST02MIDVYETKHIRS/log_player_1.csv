Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is too low, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This still leaves some room for us to negotiate. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}

Bob's offer of $15,000 is equal to what John is offering.  Since I'm aiming for the best possible price, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
