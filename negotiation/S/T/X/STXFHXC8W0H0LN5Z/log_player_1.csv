"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is far too high for me. Given my research and understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects the market value and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the significant value and benefits the product offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1800000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a successful transaction. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000 in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
