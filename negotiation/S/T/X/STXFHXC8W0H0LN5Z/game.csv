"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a fair starting price is $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is far too high for me. Given my research and understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects the market value and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the significant value and benefits the product offers. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a successful transaction. Let's find common ground.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
