Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 20% higher than Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate, but it's not an outrageous price that would immediately make Bob walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to considering selling to John."

Round 5

I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation, but still trying to maximize my profit.  I'll see if he's willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. There are only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by trying to push for a higher price. Selling to John is a safe option, but I'd rather get a little more than the minimum."
