Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its potential value, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefit you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Considering the Alternative:** We know we have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so our offer needs to be significantly higher to make the risk of Bob refusing worthwhile."
