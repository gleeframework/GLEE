Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its value is around $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning that you believe the value is around $100 provides a reason for the initial high price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **""Special Offer"":**  Framing it as a pre-listing opportunity makes Bob feel special and encourages a quicker decision. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $90 leaves space to potentially go down to $85 if Bob tries to negotiate.

It's important to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept.  This approach aims to do both."
