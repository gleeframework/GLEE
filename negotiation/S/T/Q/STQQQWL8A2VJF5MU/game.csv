"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a reasonable price considering its value, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
