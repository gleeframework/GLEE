"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth much more to you in the long run. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to a deal. How about $1079000? It's only a small difference from your offer and we can finally get this done. I really don't want to lose this deal. Let's close this.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice. Accepting her offer at $1,079,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  While you could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and you risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within your budget and leaves you with a small saving."
