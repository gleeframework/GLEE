"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm offering $1050000 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This offer is a fair compromise, and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1075000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1087500. This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1080000. This price is a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away happy. I'm confident this is the best deal we can reach, so let's close this.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
