Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my initial asking price and the product's worth to him. While I want to make a deal, accepting such a low offer would leave a lot of money on the table.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This offer is a good compromise, reflecting the product's value while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a better deal, but he's still offering a price significantly higher than my fallback option with John.  I need to decide if I want to push for more or take the guaranteed win.
