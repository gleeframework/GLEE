"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. 

This initial offer is a strong starting point, and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I know the product is worth more to Bob, and I'm confident I can secure a better price through negotiation. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $950,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 

I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a higher price, considering his value for the product is $1,200,000. This counteroffer allows for a middle ground, ensuring a profitable deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially considering Bob's initial valuation of $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price in the following rounds, securing a better deal for myself.  I'm also mindful of the remaining rounds, as I don't want to run out of time without securing a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by lowering my offer to $900,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price point that reflects the value of the product. This offer is also a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. 

By maintaining a steady negotiation strategy, I aim to reach a mutually acceptable price while ensuring that I don't compromise on my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds left, I'm becoming increasingly aware of the risk of running out of time and having to sell to John for my minimum value. While $875,000 is still a good price, it's not ideal. However, considering the time constraint and the risk of getting a lower price, it's the best option available. 

This decision represents a balance between maximizing profits and minimizing risk, ensuring a successful outcome in this negotiation."
