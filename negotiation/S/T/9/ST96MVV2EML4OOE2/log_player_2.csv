"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can potentially get the product for a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He also has the option of buying from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  He can try to negotiate further and see if he can get a better deal.  Additionally, he can always buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
