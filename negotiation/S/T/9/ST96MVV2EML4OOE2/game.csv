"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
