It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to come down to a price that's significantly better than John's offer. We've negotiated well, but it's not worth the risk of pushing Alice away completely and potentially ending up with no deal.  Buying from John for $150 ensures we get the product at a reasonable price."
