"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. This is a special offer tailored just for you, considering its worth to you is $120. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is tempting, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay and what you can get it for from John.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for your target price from John."
