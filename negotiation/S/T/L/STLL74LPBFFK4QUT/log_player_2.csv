Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $75, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $82? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $82, and it's a reasonable price compared to your $120 alternative.  Continuing to negotiate might annoy Alice or make her less willing to compromise."
