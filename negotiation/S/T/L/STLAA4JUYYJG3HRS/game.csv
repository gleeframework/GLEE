"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $14000.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $15000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your value for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,
