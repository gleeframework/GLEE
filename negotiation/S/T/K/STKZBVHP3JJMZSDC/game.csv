"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is limited. How about we start at $1,200,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to buy from John at that price if we can't reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
