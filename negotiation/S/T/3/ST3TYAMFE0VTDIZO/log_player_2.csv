{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's not worth accepting this offer. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the lowest price I'm willing to pay, which is $10,000. This is my maximum budget, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If not, I'll buy from John for the same price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price slightly higher than my maximum budget, but still lower than Alice's previous offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to get a better deal.  If Alice rejects, I'll still have the option to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still too high, and it's unlikely she'll go lower. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $10,000. It's guaranteed, and I save a significant amount of money."
