"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?  That feels like a fairer starting point.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,100,000 is too low, but I don't want to risk losing him completely. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3

Round 4
