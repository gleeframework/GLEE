"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, reflecting its high quality and potential. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?  That feels like a fairer starting point.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product while leaving room for us both to benefit from the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I think we can still find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price offers a good value for you while ensuring I can still make a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement on this round!",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I can tell we're both motivated to reach a deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,212,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",1212500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,212,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,237,500. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product. Let's finalize the deal and make this a win-win for both of us.",1237500.0,Alice,7,
