"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in your product, though. How about $80?  That's my maximum.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I need to get for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to be flexible, but that's my lowest offer.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still too high for me.  I'm really pushing my limits here, but I can go up to $95.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $95 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $110. If you're truly interested in my product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget of $80.  If you're willing to come down to $100, I'm ready to buy the product.  Otherwise, I'll need to go with another seller.",100.0,Bob,6,
