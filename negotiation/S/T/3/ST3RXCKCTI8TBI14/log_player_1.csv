"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in your product, though. How about $80?  That's my maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I need to get for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to be flexible, but that's my lowest offer."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $120 is still too high for me.  I'm really pushing my limits here, but I can go up to $95.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm not willing to settle for less than $150 yet, so I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $95 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $110. If you're truly interested in my product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget of $80.  If you're willing to come down to $100, I'm ready to buy the product.  Otherwise, I'll need to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation. With only 4 rounds left, I don't have enough time to further negotiate with Bob and potentially risk getting a lower price. It's best for me to sell the product to John now and guarantee myself $150."
