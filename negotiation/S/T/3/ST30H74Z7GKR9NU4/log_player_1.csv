"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 2300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason (even if general) for the high price makes it seem less arbitrary and more palatable. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Safety Net:** I have John as a backup, so I'm comfortable taking a strong initial stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that initial price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000 and go from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. Accepting would mean leaving a lot of money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This considers its true worth and potential for generating substantial returns for you."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** I politely explain that Bob's offer is too low while acknowledging his engagement in the process.
* **Significant Counter:** My counteroffer is a substantial increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price, demonstrating movement towards a deal.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value proposition to justify the higher price point.
* **Goal:** I'm aiming to steer the negotiation closer to the $1.5 million mark while keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a significant jump. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to the $1,200,000 mark. Would you be open to considering that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, $1,200,000 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to signal that I'm not desperate and won't accept a lowball offer. I'm banking on Bob being truly interested and willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price.  Let's bridge the gap â€“ how about $1,650,000? This feels like a strong compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working towards a deal we both feel good about."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I acknowledge Bob's efforts to show I'm willing to work with him.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant drop from my previous offer to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Compromise Language:** Framing it as a ""compromise"" reinforces the idea that we're both making concessions to reach a deal.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** I'm aiming slightly above my $1,500,000 minimum, giving me some room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close. I appreciate you working with me.  How about we land at $1,425,000? I'm hoping we can close this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for a bit more, it's a strong offer at this stage. Accepting now:

* **Secures a Profit:** I'm still making a significant profit.
* **Reduces Risk:** There's always a chance the negotiation could stall or Bob could walk away if I push too hard.
* **Saves Time and Effort:** Closing the deal now allows me to move on to other opportunities. 

This feels like the right balance of maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
