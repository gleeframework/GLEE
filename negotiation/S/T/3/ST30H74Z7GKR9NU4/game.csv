"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential return on investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that initial price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000 and go from there?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This considers its true worth and potential for generating substantial returns for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a significant jump. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to the $1,200,000 mark. Would you be open to considering that?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price.  Let's bridge the gap â€“ how about $1,650,000? This feels like a strong compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working towards a deal we both feel good about.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close. I appreciate you working with me.  How about we land at $1,425,000? I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
