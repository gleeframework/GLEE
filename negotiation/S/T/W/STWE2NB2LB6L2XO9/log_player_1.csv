{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer allows for some potential negotiation, as I'm not asking for the full $10,000 value to Bob. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, or to accept John's offer if Bob rejects my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point through further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  I think this is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,750 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me a much better price. It's time to finalize the deal and move on."
