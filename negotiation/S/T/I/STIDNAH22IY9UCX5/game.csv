"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $950,000. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this is a price we can agree on.",950000.0,Bob,4,
