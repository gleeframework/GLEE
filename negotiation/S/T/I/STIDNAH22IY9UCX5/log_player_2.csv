"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is far above his budget. He has more rounds to negotiate and can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's still above Bob's preferred budget. He can still try to negotiate a lower price and has a few rounds to work with before he needs to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $950,000. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this is a price we can agree on."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and $950,000 is a good offer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a small adjustment, but it reflects the product's unique value.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $975,000 is getting closer to his budget, he's still within his negotiation rounds and could potentially get a better price. He has the option to buy from John at $800,000, so he has a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $975,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to finalize the deal at $900,000. It's a solid offer for both of us, and we're getting very close to a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 900000}
