Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $10,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $12,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $2,000 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $12,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  It's a balancing act between profit and the certainty of a sale.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's something you'll find valuable. I'm proposing a price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Friendly, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Price:**  $11,500 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives you a strong profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($500) compared to his valuation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John is your backup, are there other potential buyers who might offer more than $10,000? This could influence your flexibility."
