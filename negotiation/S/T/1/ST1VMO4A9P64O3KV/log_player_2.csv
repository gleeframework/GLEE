"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $1,200,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than John's price, it still leaves a lot of room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This would give us both a fair profit and a smooth transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This is a strong starting point for negotiation.  I've also included a friendly message to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I need.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than I'd like to pay. While it is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'm going to make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a compromise. How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal quickly. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. I'm also highlighting the potential for a quick and easy transaction, adding a bit of incentive for Alice to accept."
