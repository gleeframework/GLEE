"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This would give us both a fair profit and a smooth transaction. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I need.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a compromise. How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal quickly. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Bob,4,
