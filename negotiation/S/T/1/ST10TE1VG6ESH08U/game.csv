"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is my best price for now.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my best price for now.",13000.0,Alice,5,
