"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but that's still quite a gap between our valuations.  I could go up to $700,000 if you're willing to meet me closer to that number?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we have some ground to cover.  To be fair, I can't go below $900,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm aiming for something under $800,000. How about $775,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",775000.0,Bob,6,
