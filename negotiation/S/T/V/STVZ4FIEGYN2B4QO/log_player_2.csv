"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is above your maximum budget. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Establish a strong starting point:**  By offering significantly less, you signal that you are a serious buyer but also looking for a good deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This offer gives you space to potentially meet in the middle without exceeding your budget.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** Her response will give you a better sense of how low she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice reduced her price, but it's still above your ideal price and what John is offering. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You've moved up from your initial offer, signaling you're willing to negotiate.
* **Still aims for a good deal:** The $9,000 price point keeps you well below Alice's starting price and closer to John's offer.
* **Tests Alice's flexibility:**  This counteroffer encourages Alice to consider a price closer to your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,500. Since John is offering the product for $10,000, there's no point in further negotiation with Alice. You're better off taking John's offer and saving the extra $500."
