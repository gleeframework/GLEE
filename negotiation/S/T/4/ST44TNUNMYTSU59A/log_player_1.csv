Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives me a potential profit of $2,000 more than selling to John.  While I don't know Bob's valuation, there's a chance he might find the product worth more than $12,000 and be willing to pay it. This approach balances the risk of rejection with the potential for a higher return."
