"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1650000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 5-year warranty, which normally costs $100000. This way, you'll get an even better deal than my previous offer. I'm sticking to $1650000, but I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product with added value. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,7,
