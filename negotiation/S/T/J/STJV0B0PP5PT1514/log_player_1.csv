"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  It's important to hold out for a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not high enough.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.  The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is not worth the potential for a lower price."
