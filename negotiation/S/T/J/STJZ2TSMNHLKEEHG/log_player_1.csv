{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from his perceived value ($1,000,000), but still allows you to earn significantly more than your minimum desired price ($800,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. How about $850,000? I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum desired price, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows you to gain significant value from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am comfortable with. How about $875,000? I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. It's a good compromise and worth accepting."
