"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  Could you consider $1,350,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'd like to counteroffer with $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,310,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1310000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,310,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my financial constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
