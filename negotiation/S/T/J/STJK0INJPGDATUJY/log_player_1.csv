Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1.3 million, Bob seems firm in his pricing around $1.25 million. Accepting his offer at $1,250,000 is still significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000. It's time to secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
