"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is slightly above Bob's value for the product, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I'm also aware of John's offer, which is my safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $85, which is still more than my minimum value of $80. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential loss."
