Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He'll only accept an offer at or below that price.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a negotiated agreement with Bob is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation.

**The Strategy**

Since a mutually beneficial deal with Bob is unlikely, your best option is to make an offer that you know Bob will reject. This allows you to move on to John and secure your guaranteed $1,500,000.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Why this Works**

* **Above Bob's Limit:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, ensuring he'll reject it.
* **Maintains Credibility:** While high, the price isn't ridiculously above your minimum. This maintains the impression that the product is valuable, potentially making your deal with John smoother. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no way of changing Bob's perception of the product's value to him."
