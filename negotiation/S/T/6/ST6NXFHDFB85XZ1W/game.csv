"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about $8,500? This is a good compromise, and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair deal.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $8,000.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value your interest, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to drop to $8,200. This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision.",8200.0,Alice,5,
