While I could push for more in the next round, accepting Bob's offer of $1,950,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  Even at $1,950,000, I am securing a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress Stalled:** Bob has been consistently increasing his offer, but in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows me to reinvest the earnings sooner, potentially yielding a better return than waiting for a slightly higher offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  There's always a chance that Bob walks away in later rounds, leaving me to accept John's offer of $1,500,000. 

Accepting $1,950,000 represents a strong balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with a reasonable degree of certainty."
