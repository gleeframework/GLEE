"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000?  I'm confident this price reflects a win-win for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,900,000 is getting closer, but I need to be above $2,000,000 for this deal to make sense.  Would you be willing to consider $2,000,000 even?  This would be a sign of good faith on my end, and I'm hopeful we can close this out.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
