Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's value while still ensuring the deal is attractive enough for him to accept.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting the product's value.
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,400,000 leaves a $100,000 gain for Bob, which is significant and incentivizes him to accept.
* **Confident Tone:** You present the price as a fair deal rather than a starting point for negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You could start higher (closer to $1,500,000) and be prepared to negotiate down slightly if needed. The key is to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
