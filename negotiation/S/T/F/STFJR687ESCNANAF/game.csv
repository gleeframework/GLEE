"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1000000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1750000. This reflects a substantial price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm ready to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1250000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1500000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
