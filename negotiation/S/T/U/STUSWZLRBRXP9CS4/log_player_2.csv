Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but given the value of the product, I would like to counter with a price of $9,500. This still allows for a fair profit while being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

* **Significant savings:** Bob is saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Minimal risk:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might reject his offer again. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price with minimal risk."
