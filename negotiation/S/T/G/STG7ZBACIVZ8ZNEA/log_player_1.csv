Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more palatable.  
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act.

While Bob might reject this initial offer, it gives you a starting point to potentially negotiate down towards a price that's still profitable for you but potentially appealing to him."
