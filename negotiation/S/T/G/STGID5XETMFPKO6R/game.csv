"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on it.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the fact that I am ready to purchase right now.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
