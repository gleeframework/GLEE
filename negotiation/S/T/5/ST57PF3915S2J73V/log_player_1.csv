Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,300,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product for me is quite significant, and $850,000 is too low.

Bob's offer:
