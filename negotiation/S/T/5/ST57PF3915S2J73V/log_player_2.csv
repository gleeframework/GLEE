# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth attempting to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your price point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product for me is quite significant, and $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle somewhat - would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
