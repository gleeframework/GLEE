,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a bargain, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $97 as the price for your product.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $97 is still below my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $101?  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",101.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal of $97. I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.",97.0,Bob,6,
