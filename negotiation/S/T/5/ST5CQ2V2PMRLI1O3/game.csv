"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000?  That gives you a good deal, and still leaves me with a fair profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
