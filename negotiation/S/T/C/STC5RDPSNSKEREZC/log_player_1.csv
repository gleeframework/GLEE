"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $140. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to him and $120 to me. This gives him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, I can still aim for a higher price.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and I believe it's within Bob's range of acceptable prices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered the same price again, $130. While I'd prefer a bit more, it's still a decent profit and we're already at round 4.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $120."
