"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this sale."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $13,500 is simply not going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $14,250? It's a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum price.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to meet me at a price that's fair for both of us. It's better to sell to John for $15,000 and ensure I get my minimum price."
