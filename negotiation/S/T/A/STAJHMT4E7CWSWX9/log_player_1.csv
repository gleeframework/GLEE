{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product exclusively to you before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $110 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice makes a good profit.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning this is a limited-time offer before a wider release, we nudge Bob towards a quicker decision."
