"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $1,400,000, a price that reflects its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You can get the product for $1,400,000 from Alice, which is cheaper than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You're still within your budget.** The $1,400,000 offer is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option."
