"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $110.** This is better than John's price of $120. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money.** Accepting this offer saves Bob $10 compared to buying from John. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.** While Bob could try for $107 or $108, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and it could lead to a drawn-out negotiation with no guarantee of success."
