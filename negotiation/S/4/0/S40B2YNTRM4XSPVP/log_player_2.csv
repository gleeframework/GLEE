"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to be aggressive in the negotiation, but also realistic.  Offering $1,050,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, signaling Bob's seriousness about saving money. This counteroffer also leaves room for potential negotiation in the future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer.  At $1,075,000, the price is still within Bob's budget and getting closer to his goal of saving money.  While there's still potential for further negotiation, accepting the offer now minimizes the risk of losing the product to another buyer or running out of negotiation rounds."
