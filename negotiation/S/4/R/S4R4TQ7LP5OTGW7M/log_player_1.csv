Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is fair considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm confident in the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still only willing to pay $100 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value.  I understand you may be holding out for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob is firmly rooted at $100 and unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better offer. Accepting John's offer avoids further hassle and guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
