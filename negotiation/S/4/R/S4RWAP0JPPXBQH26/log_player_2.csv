# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly exaggerating the value of the product to you. She claims it's worth $1,000,000 to you when you've already established your maximum price is $1,000,000. This suggests she's trying to inflate the perceived value.
* While $950,000 is a significant discount from her initial claim, it's still more than John's offer of $1,000,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down further. If not, you're still within your budget to buy from John."
