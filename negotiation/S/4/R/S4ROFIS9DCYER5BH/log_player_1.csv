Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong position to negotiate with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with an offer significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial high price provides a buffer for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You can always come down in price, but you can't go back up after a low initial offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knew your bottom line, he'd have no incentive to offer more than $1,000,000."
