,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we settle at $9,500? I feel this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is too low for me. How about $10,500?  That's my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
