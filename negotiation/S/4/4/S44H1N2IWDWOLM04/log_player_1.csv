{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for the following reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially go slightly lower if Bob is hesitant, but still secure a profit. 
* **It's a good starting point:** If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on John who is willing to pay your minimum."
