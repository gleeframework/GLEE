"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a significant discount from the original price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $900,000. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
