"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and you'll be getting a valuable asset for a great price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make this happen!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $950000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a fair price that allows me to recover a decent amount, and it still offers you a great value.  Let's seal the deal.
