"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and you'll be getting a valuable asset for a great price. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $950000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a fair price that allows me to recover a decent amount, and it still offers you a great value.  Let's seal the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
