"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within your budget, but it's still too high. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. You can counteroffer and try to get closer to your target price before resorting to John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider letting it go for $1,275,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your target price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. You can try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. You're still better off negotiating with Alice than buying from John at a higher price."
