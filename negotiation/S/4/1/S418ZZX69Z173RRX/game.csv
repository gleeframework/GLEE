"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider letting it go for $1,275,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,275,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
