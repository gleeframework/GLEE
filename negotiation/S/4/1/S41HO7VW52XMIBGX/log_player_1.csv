{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm willing to make this transaction particularly attractive for you, so I'm offering it at the price of $1,300,000.  Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $800,000, which gives you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,300,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's valuation, providing room for negotiation.
    * Still leaves room for Bob to perceive value and potentially accept a lower price.
    *  Allows you to potentially make a higher profit than John's offer.

**The Goal:**  This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
