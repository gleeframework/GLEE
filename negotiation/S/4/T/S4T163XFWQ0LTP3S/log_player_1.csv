{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum, giving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my spending within $80. Could you possibly lower your price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still not high enough for me. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This would be a great price for a product worth more to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
