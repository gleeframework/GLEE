# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
