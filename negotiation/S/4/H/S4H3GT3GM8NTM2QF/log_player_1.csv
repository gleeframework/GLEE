Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. It's worth $100 to you, and to ensure a smooth transaction, I'm willing to offer it at the special price of $110. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), I can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Slight Markup:** Offering the product slightly above Bob's perceived value creates a small margin for negotiation while still being attractive if he values a quick and easy purchase.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is polite, highlights the product's value, and clearly states the asking price. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject the offer at $110. However, I'm willing to take that risk for the potential of a higher profit. If he rejects it, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
