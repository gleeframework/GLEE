"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000,  which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,350,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,325,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
