"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.
* It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price. 
*  Buying from John immediately would be the safest option, but it would mean paying the full $8,000, while negotiation has the potential to save you money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within your budget. It shows you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** The message provides a brief reason for the counteroffer, showing you're not just throwing out a random number.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** While $7,000 is your ideal price, there's room to potentially meet in the middle, leaving space for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $7,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  $10,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. While it's a compromise from Alice's initial offer, it's not a good deal for you.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. You can counteroffer again, aiming to get the price closer to your target.
* **John's Offer:**  While buying from John for $8,000 is a safe option, you haven't exhausted all possibilities with Alice yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer represents a significant increase from your previous offer, showing you are willing to compromise.
* **Approaching Your Limit:** $8,500 is close to your maximum budget, indicating a willingness to pay a fair price but not overpaying.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive, emphasizing a desire to reach a final agreement."
