"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to offer $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more. There are 8 rounds remaining, and I can always sell to John if I don't get a better deal.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I'm  firmly at $12,000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $12000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11000.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and his offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 less than my previous counteroffer. Considering that I can always sell to John for $10,000, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best choice. It secures a better deal than selling to John, and there's a chance I could have a more difficult time getting a better offer in the remaining rounds."
