"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will bring you great value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair and reasonable offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000, as that's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise that reflects the value I believe the product holds. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to a deal.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last push to try to reach a deal. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000, but this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
