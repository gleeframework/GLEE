"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. It's better to see if she'll come down in price, as paying $9,500 is only a small savings compared to your alternative option of John."
