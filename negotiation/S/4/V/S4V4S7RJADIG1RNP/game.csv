"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. It's a great product, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,050,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $975,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to achieve our goals. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $975,000, so I'm offering $925,000. Can we shake on it?",925000.0,Bob,6,
