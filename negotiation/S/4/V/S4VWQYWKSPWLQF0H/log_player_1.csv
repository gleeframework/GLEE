Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This gives her a strong position to negotiate.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). However, it leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above John's offer.
* **Justification and Urgency:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the offer as ""exclusive,"" creating a sense of urgency and importance.

**Outcome Possibilities:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Alice earns a profit of $350,000 (significantly more than selling to John).
* **Bob Negotiates:** Bob might counter-offer. Alice can then decide to negotiate further or stick closer to her initial price, knowing she has John as a backup.
* **Bob Rejects:**  Alice can sell to John for her guaranteed $1,500,000. 

This strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while minimizing risk, given her strong position."
