"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $1100000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1125000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where he's very close to his target price, but Alice is still above it. With only five rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get Alice to go any lower. It's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John at his target price."
