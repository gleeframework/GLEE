"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, that price seems a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a counteroffer lower than what you're actually willing to pay. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to save as much as possible. Starting at $110 aims for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a good deal below my $150 maximum.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is phrased politely to maintain a good rapport with Alice, but also clearly states that the initial price is too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, $125 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It secures the product for me at a price well below my maximum budget."
