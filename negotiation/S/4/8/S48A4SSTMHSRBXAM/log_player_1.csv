Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $160 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John.  It's important to consider the potential for future negotiations with Bob if he's a good customer."
