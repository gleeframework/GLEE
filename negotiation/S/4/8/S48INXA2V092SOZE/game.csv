"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,250,000, but I'm still a little short of my target price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This price is closer to my bottom line, and I believe it still reflects the value the product offers you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
