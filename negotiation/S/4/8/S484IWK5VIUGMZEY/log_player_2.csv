{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and is still within Bob's budget. It's a fair starting point for the negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his preferred price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive, and Bob can still potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  $8,750 represents a compromise,  showing that Bob is willing to negotiate but still wants to stay within his budget. It's also a good midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating and risk the possibility of Alice rejecting further offers, accepting this offer is the most logical decision.  It's a good deal for Bob, and it avoids the risk of losing the product or having to pay John's higher price."
