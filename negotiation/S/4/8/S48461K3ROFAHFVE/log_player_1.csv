Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal and will be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and appear more flexible if you need to come down. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his interest level and potential to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for $120, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer to your target, you know John will meet your minimum. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $110.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident you'll find it's worth that price."", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $130, you're showing a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob partway. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This price keeps you comfortably above your $120 minimum and leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate further.
* **Justification:** Highlighting your confidence in the product's value helps reinforce the idea that the price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $120. While you could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
