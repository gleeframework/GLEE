Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I want to start with a significantly higher offer to explore his willingness to pay.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $14,000 price leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, I can gauge his interest and potentially still settle for a price above my minimum.
* **Backup Option:** I have the security of John's offer at $10,000, which serves as my baseline. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can decide whether to negotiate further or move on to John."
