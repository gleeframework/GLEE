Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Bob has met my lowest acceptable price.  There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price with him, and waiting carries the risk of him reducing his offer.  Taking the $8,000 is the safest option now."
