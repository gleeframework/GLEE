Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

This offer attempts to maximize profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  Here's the logic:

* **$150 is my minimum:** I won't sell for less than this, as I can always sell to John.
* **$200 is a reasonable starting point:** It's a significant markup from my minimum, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. 
* **Negotiation is expected:** Bob might counteroffer, and I'm willing to negotiate within a range. 

By starting at $200, I can potentially earn more than $150 from Bob, while still having a fallback option with John."
