Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could come down to $85, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, her ""final offer"" of $85 is still more than John's offer of $80.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a better result. Buying from John guarantees the lowest price."
