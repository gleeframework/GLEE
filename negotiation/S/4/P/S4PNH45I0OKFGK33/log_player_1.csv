"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's worth a significant amount to me, but I believe you'd find it even more valuable.  My initial offer is $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This price is still attractive for you while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a loss compared to what I think I can get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - I'll offer the product for $1,075,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
