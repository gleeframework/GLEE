"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's worth a significant amount to me, but I believe you'd find it even more valuable.  My initial offer is $1100000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still attractive for you while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1050000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1100000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - I'll offer the product for $1075000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's still a good deal for Bob as it's significantly less than John's offer of $1,200,000. Additionally, Alice's offer is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000, indicating that further negotiation might not lead to a much better price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price while maintaining a good relationship with Alice for future potential transactions."
