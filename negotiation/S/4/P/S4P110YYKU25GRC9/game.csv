"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1000000 is significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
