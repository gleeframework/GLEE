"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me. I'm open to discussing a compromise, but I won't go above my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's opening offer is exactly his stated value. This means we have little room to negotiate upwards from his number.  It's unlikely we'll get significantly more from Bob.  Therefore, the best option is to take the guaranteed profit with John.
