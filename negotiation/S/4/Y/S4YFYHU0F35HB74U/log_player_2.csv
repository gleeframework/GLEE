Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
At this point, Alice seems firm on her price, and further haggling might not yield a significantly better deal. Accepting at $108 is a reasonable compromise.  It's better to secure the product now at a price significantly lower than John's $150 offer."
