"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, so Alice's offer is too high. I will reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range. This will allow me to see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal before I have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our desired prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll reject and try for one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but only slightly. I'm hoping that Alice will see that I'm serious about making a deal, and that she'll be willing to meet me in the middle.  I'm also aware that I'm getting closer to the point where buying from John might be the better option, so I need to be careful not to push her away."
