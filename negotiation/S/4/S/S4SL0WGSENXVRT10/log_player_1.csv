"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm counter-offering at $120. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway. I hope this encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $110.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept.  If he rejects again, I'll be more likely to sell to John in the next round."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is still not willing to meet my price, and we're running out of time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $100 to ensure I at least get my minimum value."
