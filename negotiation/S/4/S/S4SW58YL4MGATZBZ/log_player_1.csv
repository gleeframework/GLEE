"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives Bob a strong incentive to accept, but also shows him I'm serious about getting close to the product's full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While selling to John for $800,000 is tempting, I'm going to try to push for a better price with Bob. I have 8 rounds left and still have leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than John's offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too low.  I'm going to hold out for a better price. Selling to John for $800,000 is still on the table, but I have a few more rounds to try and squeeze more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a price that's only $25,000 less than my last offer. This shows him I'm willing to compromise and hopefully gets us closer to a deal.  We only have 5 rounds left, so it's getting tight.  I'm still going to hold out for a price closer to $850,000, but I'm also aware that John's offer is always a possibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, we are running out of time.  I have only 4 rounds left and it's likely Bob will keep offering a lower price. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit and is the safest option at this point."
