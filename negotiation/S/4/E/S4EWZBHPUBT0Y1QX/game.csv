"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1150000. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",1100000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1120000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1100000, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you accept this price?",1100000.0,Bob,6,,
