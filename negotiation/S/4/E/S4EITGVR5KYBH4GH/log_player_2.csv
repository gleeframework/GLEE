"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John, there's no financial benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might as well buy from John."
