"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $18000?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $19000 is a more reasonable price for this unique product. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $19000. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $19000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $17500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $17500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I think $18500 is the minimum I can accept. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make a final offer of $17000. I've done my research and I think that's a fair price for this product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000",17000.0,Bob,6,
