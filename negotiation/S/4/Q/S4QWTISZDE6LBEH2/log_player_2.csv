"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer though. How about $110? That gives us both a good deal.

You're still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is closer to your target, it's still above your limit. You can try one more counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
