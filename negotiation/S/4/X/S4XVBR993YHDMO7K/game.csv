"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to recover a portion of the value I place on the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $10,250 is a good offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we meet at $10,400? This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,400. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",10300.0,Bob,6,
