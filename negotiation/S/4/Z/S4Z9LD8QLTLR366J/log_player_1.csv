Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $1,000,000 is a significant offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate lower if needed. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to close this deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's room for negotiation. I can counter with a price higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a middle ground.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me confidence to be firm in my negotiations with Bob. 

I'm choosing to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for this product. This reflects its value to you while still being a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Toward Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him while still emphasizing my own need for a reasonable price.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose too much in the negotiation.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will be attractive to Bob, as it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still securing a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low for me. 
* **Room for One More Counter:** I can afford to make one more counteroffer to try to close the gap. 
* **John's Offer Still Secure:** I have the safety net of John's $1,200,000 offer, so I can be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

I'm choosing to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $920,000 is still a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to secure a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  I'm aiming for a final counteroffer to close the deal.
* **Compromise and Finality:** I'm offering a price that's almost exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while also communicating that I'm firm on my stance.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price for both parties, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Call to Action:**  I'm ending with a call to action to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and closing the deal with Bob before I resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $915,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $915,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems we've reached a point where Bob is unlikely to go any higher, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **John's Offer is More Lucrative:** With John offering $1,200,000, it's clear that selling to him is the most profitable option.

**Conclusion:** 

I've decided to **sell the product to John** for $1,200,000. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, his final offer was still below my minimum acceptable price.  John's offer guarantees me a higher profit and a more secure deal."
