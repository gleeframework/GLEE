{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals that you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you'd like to pay. You have more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better deal.  You should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to $95."

{""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**
