"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a good starting point for us to negotiate from.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, $650,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $975,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. While I want to find a way for you to own this, I also need to be mindful of the value I'm representing.  I can go as low as $900,000, but that's my firm limit.  It's a significant price reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your firm limit, but I need to be honest,  $900,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I can do $800,000, which is my final offer.  I think it's a fair price considering John is willing to sell it at that price right now.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,6,
