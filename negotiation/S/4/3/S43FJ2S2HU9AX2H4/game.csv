"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $10,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
