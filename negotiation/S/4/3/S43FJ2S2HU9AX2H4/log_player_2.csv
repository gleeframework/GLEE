Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $10,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result than buying from John."
