Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $850,000.  This price reflects its value to me while giving you a good return. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.

This represents a significant compromise on my end, but I'm willing to be flexible if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's unlikely to reach a number significantly closer to my minimum. Accepting his current offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's standing offer. It's time to move on."
