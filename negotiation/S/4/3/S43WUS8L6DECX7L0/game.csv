"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something you've been looking for, and I know it'll be a game-changer for your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, so I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. Let's discuss!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about we settle on $950,000? This leaves room for both of us to be happy.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000. How about we settle on $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 still isn't quite there for me. How about $925,000? It's a good middle ground and allows us to close this deal fairly.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $925,000. How about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $900,000 is still below what I need. I'm willing to go down to $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",912500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $912,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but no more. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,8,
