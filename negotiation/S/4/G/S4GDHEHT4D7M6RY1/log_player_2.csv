"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price that I believe is fair, given its potential to benefit your business. Let's discuss the details and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than John's price, but it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal and might incentivize Alice to lower her price further."
