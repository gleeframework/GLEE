"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $80 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $82 just yet. How about we try $87? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",87.0,Alice,5,
