"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price. I want to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no need to rush into a deal, and I have 9 more rounds to see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $7,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit tight for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target of $7,000. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground. I have more rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into accepting just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land somewhere in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $7,100.  This seems like a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $7,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been firm on her price, and I've already made a few counteroffers. At this point, I'm close to my target price of $7,000. While $7,200 is a little higher, it's still a good deal and worth accepting.  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice might walk away, and I'd be stuck buying from John at a higher price. It's time to close the deal and save some money."
