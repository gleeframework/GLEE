"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer you $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's split the difference and meet at $9,250.  This would be a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me though.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our positions.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. Let's try $9,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $8,900. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,6,
