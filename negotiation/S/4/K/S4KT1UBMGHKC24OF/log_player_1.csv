I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point that allows room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing negotiations with him or if I should just sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my original offer, but it's still worth trying to get closer to $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for some potential profit. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my ideal price. While I'd love to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of another round of negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer is too high.  It's time to take the deal."
