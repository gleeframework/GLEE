"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you ($9,500 vs. $10,000).**  
* **While it's a better price than John's, you can still do better.** You can reject Alice's offer and likely negotiate a lower price with John or find another seller."
