"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation.  While I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it for now.  I believe there's still room for a higher offer.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is another compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also still higher than John's offer, so I'm not in a rush to close the deal yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  I've tried to negotiate, but it seems he's not willing to come up much.  I'm going to accept John's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's still a good price and I'm confident I'll be able to find a better buyer in the future."
