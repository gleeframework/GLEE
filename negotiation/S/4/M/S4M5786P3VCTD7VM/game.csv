"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on a price closer to $800,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $875,000 as a compromise. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but $890,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be at $880,000 or lower. If we can meet at that price, I'm willing to make the deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,
