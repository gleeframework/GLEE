,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we split the difference? I'd be happy to buy it for $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm getting closer to your price, $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $9,500. If that works for you, we have a deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
