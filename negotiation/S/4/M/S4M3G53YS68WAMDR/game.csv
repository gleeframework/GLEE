"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
