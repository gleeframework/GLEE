"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. This price is above my minimum threshold, allowing me to potentially settle for a lower price without losing too much. I'll keep John in mind as a backup option throughout the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm not willing to accept his first offer, hoping to secure a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000 to make this deal work. This price still allows me to profit from the sale, and it's a significant step closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise and is significantly higher than John's offer. It's important to secure a sale within the remaining rounds, and this offer provides a good balance between my desired profit and the risk of continuing to negotiate."
