Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price again, potentially closer to his goal of $1,000,000."
