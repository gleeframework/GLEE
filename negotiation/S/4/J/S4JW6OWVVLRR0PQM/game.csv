"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,750.  That's a fair compromise, and still a great price for you considering the product's value.",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,750 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to settle at $11,200?",11200.0,Bob,4,
