{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, reminding him that he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While I'd like to make a sale, $10,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation is Worthwhile:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I'm confident I can get a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option in case this negotiation falls through, but I want to explore getting a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,750.  That's a fair compromise, and still a great price for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a middle ground price that's closer to my minimum value, but still appealing to Bob. 
* **Re-Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to accept. 
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm using language that positions my offer as a fair and reasonable compromise. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and move the negotiation towards a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,750 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to settle at $11,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,200 is very close to my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, there's a chance Bob might not budge further. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject this offer and continue to negotiate, I risk Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with only the $10,000 offer from John. 

Considering the risk of losing the deal and the close proximity to my minimum price, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
