"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you believe in the intrinsic value of the product, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth the price you're quoting. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,600,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,580,000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. Can we agree on this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000

Bob is clearly very interested and has made a considerable effort to meet my price.  While I could hold out for more, accepting this offer guarantees a good profit without risking the deal with a new counteroffer."
