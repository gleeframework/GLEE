"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good price quickly.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to adjust downwards, but I want to see if I can get a quick win!"

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to see if I can push for a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
