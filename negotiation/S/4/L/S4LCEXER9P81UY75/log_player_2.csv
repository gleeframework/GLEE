"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this incredible product, which I'm sure you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. It's a steal at this price, considering its worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is quite high ($9,500). While she tries to convince you it's worth $10,000 to you, you know your maximum price is $10,000.  By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or go with your backup option (John) and save $500."
