"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I was hoping to keep it a bit lower.  Could you do $78? That's a firm offer from me.",78.0,Bob,4,
