"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a good chance he'll see this as a fair deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair price and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good deal for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,700 is getting closer to my target, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'm running out of time, but I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm offering $8,900 as a counteroffer.  This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it shows I'm still willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we're close to a deal and accept this offer.  We're running out of time, so I need to make sure I get a decent price while also being mindful of the risk of losing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,800. Although it's not my ideal price, it's only $100 less than my last counteroffer and we're running out of time. It's better than selling to John for $8,000 and I'm getting closer to my target price."
