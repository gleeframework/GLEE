Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. A quick acceptance means you might have gone even higher.  A strong counter means he's serious but wants to negotiate. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000. This knowledge gives you leverage to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it's not meeting your needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is already higher than his perceived value of $1,200,000, indicating he's quite interested. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between his offer and both your starting price and your minimum. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  You can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000. This gives you the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I understand you're looking for a fair deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,725,000?"", ""product_price"": 1725000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down significantly from our initial price, signaling to Bob that we're willing to negotiate.
* **Targeting Above Our Minimum:** The new price is still substantially above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving us room to maneuver.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We've countered with a price closer to our starting point than Bob's, aiming to anchor the negotiation in our favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,725,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to increase my offer to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding Our Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Counteroffer:**  He increased his offer significantly, showing he's serious about closing the deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments above this point. Accepting now secures a very good profit. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** There's always a chance Bob could walk away if we push further, leaving us to sell to John at $1,500,000. Accepting eliminates that risk."
