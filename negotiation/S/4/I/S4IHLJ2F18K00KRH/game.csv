"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I understand you're looking for a fair deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,725,000?",1725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,725,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to increase my offer to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
