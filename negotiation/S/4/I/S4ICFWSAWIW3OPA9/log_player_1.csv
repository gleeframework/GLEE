Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately killing the deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob knows what's being offered and what's expected of him.
* **It leaves room for conversation:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $120. I'm not going to accept that offer. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Bob's offer:** It shows I'm listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Offers a compromise:**  $85 is in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's last one, signaling a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Invites further discussion:**  The ""Let me know what you think"" keeps the door open for continued negotiation."
