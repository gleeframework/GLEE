"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the tone for a strong negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value and want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price point too quickly.  This middle ground gives Bob room to compromise while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While tempting, $700,000 is still too low. I'm  willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to see if he's willing to come up on his offer. John is a safe option at $800,000, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $850,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  However, it's still above my minimum threshold and leaves room for further negotiation.  This offer aims to gauge Bob's seriousness and whether he's ready to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $800,000.  Bob's offers are consistently below my desired price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to earn more, I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price or running out of time. John provides a secure and reliable option that meets my minimum requirement."
