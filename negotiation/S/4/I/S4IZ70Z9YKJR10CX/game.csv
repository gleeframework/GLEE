"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my valuation. Would you consider a counteroffer of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is closer to our starting point, I believe we can bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still offers significant value to you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a deal that satisfies both our needs.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
