Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $11,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm getting close to the point where I need to consider other options, but I'd rather close the deal with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear that she is unwilling to go below $11,000.  It's unlikely she'll change her stance in the remaining rounds.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save yourself $1,500."
