"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $9,500?  I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can sell it to you for $11,000. I'm getting a bit concerned that we might be getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I want to make sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $10,500?  That's a significant compromise on my initial offer and I'm hoping we can close the deal now.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $11,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm getting close to the point where I need to consider other options, but I'd rather close the deal with you if possible.",11500.0,Alice,7,
