Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties are between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage.  Here's how to approach it:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I've had significant interest from other buyers, but I believe this would be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confidence:** The message starts by highlighting demand, implying you're not desperate.
* **Value Emphasis:** Instead of focusing solely on price, you subtly remind Bob of the product's benefits.
* **Strong Opening:**  $1,450,000 gives you room to negotiate down slightly while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or try to negotiate. 
* **Your Bottom Line:** Remember, you walk away with $1,500,000 from John, so don't feel pressured to accept a low offer.
* **Relationship:**  While you want the best price, consider if maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important for future dealings."
