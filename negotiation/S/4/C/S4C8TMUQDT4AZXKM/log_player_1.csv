"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price.  Bob's offer is a starting point, but I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product has value beyond Bob's initial offer.  I hope this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved up to $160, which is getting closer to my preferred price.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that he'll walk away or that I'll run out of rounds and have to sell to John for less.  $160 is a good compromise, so I'm going to accept his offer."
