You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice's offer is $15,000, it is not a good deal. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will entice Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate further to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500.  This is still within my budget and shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a better price.  I'm hoping this is close enough to her value that she might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While I could continue to counteroffer, it's likely that Alice won't go lower than $10,000 given that's her minimum value.  To avoid further negotiation, I'm going to purchase the product from John for $10,000. This ensures I get the product at my desired price and saves me time and effort."
