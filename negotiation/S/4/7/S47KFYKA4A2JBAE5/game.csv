"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
