"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer considering the benefits it brings. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from $17,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
