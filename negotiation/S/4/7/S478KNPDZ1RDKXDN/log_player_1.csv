Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly beneficial acquisition for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might value certain aspects we're unaware of and be willing to pay more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $1,300,000 allows for negotiation.  Bob may counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000.
* **Backup Plan (John):**  We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We need to gauge Bob's interest level and potential to negotiate. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If time is a factor, we might adjust our approach to be more aggressive."
