Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where a deal can happen is between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not price Bob out. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have some leverage.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and market value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting near your minimum but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:**  Phrases like ""exceptional product"" and ""fair deal"" convey value.
* **Focus on Bob's Gain:** Highlighting ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him. 

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $1,450,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. You can decide if you're willing to go lower, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and get your guaranteed $1,500,000. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance."
