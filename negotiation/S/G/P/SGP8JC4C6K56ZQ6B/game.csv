"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I'm happy to see we're getting closer, $600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $650000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiation. Let's see if we can close this deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
