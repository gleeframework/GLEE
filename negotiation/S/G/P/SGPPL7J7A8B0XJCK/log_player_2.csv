{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value with her description. 
* While $140 is less than your $150 maximum, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy it from John at $150. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to see if she'll come down further in price, potentially getting you a better deal."
