"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $125.
*  Rejecting the offer means you can buy from John for $150, but you are willing to pay that much.
* This allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice later, or at least keep the option open to do so."
