"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I can't go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",800000.0,Bob,4,
