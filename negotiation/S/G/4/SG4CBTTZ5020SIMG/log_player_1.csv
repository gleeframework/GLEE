Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) establishes a firm position and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. 
* **Positive Framing:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob aims to create interest and justify the price.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, there's always a chance Bob could counter-offer with a price between $8,000 and $10,000. You'll need to decide if accepting a slightly lower price from Bob is preferable to waiting for John."
