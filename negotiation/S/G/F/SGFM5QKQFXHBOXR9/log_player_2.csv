The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $120. It is better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $70 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to me and I'm willing to pay a small premium."

While $110 is closer to my limit, I'm still better off trying to negotiate a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer to $75.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to her value and within my budget."

Alice's offer is still too high.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $80, which is within my budget and a better deal than Alice's current offer."
