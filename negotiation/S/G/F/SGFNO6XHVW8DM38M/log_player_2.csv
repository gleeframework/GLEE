"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good price:** It's lower than John's offer and closer to Bob's desired price. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:** While Bob could try to get an even lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept. 
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing the negotiation could take longer, potentially leading to John's price becoming more attractive."
