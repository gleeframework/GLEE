"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 isn't a terrible price, you know you have a backup option at $15,000. There's a chance you can get Alice to lower her price further or you'll have to resort to John's offer."
