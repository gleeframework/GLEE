"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $650,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
