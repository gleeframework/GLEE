"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than what John is offering."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $650,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

While $725,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 6
