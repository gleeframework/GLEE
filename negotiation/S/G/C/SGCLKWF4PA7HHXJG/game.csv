"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140?",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $140 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $147. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",147.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $142. That's the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",142.0,Alice,7,
