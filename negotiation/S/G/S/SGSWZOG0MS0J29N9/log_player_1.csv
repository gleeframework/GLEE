Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives it as a good opportunity or essential for his needs.
* **Below John's Offer:** The price is still below what John is willing to pay, ensuring that even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is still making a profit. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If she had that information, she could tailor her offer more precisely. 
* Bob's reaction to this initial offer will be crucial in determining the next steps in the negotiation."
