"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a significant advantage over your estimated value, and it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me here.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
