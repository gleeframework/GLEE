"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can see the value in working with you, Bob. I'd like to counter with a price of $880000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $880000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $860000. Can you consider this revised offer?",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $870000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $870000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $865000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this revised offer?",865000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $867500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is the final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",867500.0,Alice,7,
