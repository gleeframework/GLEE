"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and engage in the negotiation process. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

By aiming high initially, I'm setting the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. There's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I value this product highly, and while your offer is tempting, I believe it deserves to be closer to the $1,000,000 mark. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm lowering my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **But Stand Firm:**  The counteroffer is still above $1,000,000, reinforcing the product's value and my goal.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This price aims to meet Bob somewhere in the middle, encouraging him to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would that price point work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally moving towards my target price, showing he's still invested in the negotiation.  While $950,000 is tempting, I believe I can still bridge the gap further and aim for a slightly higher figure before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the true value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $985,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 985000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I acknowledge Bob's understanding of the product's value to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer.  It signals a willingness to make a deal while still striving for a higher price point.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  With fewer rounds remaining, this offer encourages Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close.  I'm willing to make a move to  $970,000 to get this done today.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $970,000 is a very good offer, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further extended negotiations.
* **Limited Upside:** While I might be able to push for slightly more in the remaining rounds, the potential gain is small compared to the risk of losing this offer. 

This offer represents a solid compromise and a favorable outcome for both parties."
