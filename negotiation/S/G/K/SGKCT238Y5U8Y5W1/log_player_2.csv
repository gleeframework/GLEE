Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done. I'm now offering the product to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At $925,000, Alice's offer is now getting close to your absolute limit with John ($1,000,000).  Alice has indicated this is her lowest price. Continuing to negotiate might save a small amount, but it also risks:

* **Alice Walking Away:**  She's already stated her bottom line.
* **Wasting Negotiation Rounds:**  You only have 10 rounds, and getting closer to John's price may not be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.

This offer represents a reasonable compromise and a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer."
