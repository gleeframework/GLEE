"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,300,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the immense value you'll gain from it.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. This offer is a good compromise and allows us to move forward. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I can agree to $1,150,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. This offer stands, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
