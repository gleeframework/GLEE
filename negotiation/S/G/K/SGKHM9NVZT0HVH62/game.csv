"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,500 for this product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $6,750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",6750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $6,900. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",6900.0,Alice,5,
