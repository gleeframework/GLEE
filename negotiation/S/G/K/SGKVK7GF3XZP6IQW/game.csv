"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to pay.  Considering my budget and the true value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you and acknowledges our previous negotiations.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can finally agree on a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you and acknowledges our previous negotiations. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
