Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.
