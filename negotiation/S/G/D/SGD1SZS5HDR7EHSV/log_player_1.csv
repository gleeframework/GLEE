{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you considerable resources in the long run. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Negotiation Zone:** This creates a potential negotiation zone of $700,000 ($1,500,000 - $800,000).

By offering the product at $1,300,000:

* **You secure a significant profit:**  $500,000 above your minimum.
* **Bob gets a good deal:** He saves $200,000 from his perceived value.

This starting point leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer while still aiming for a win-win situation."
