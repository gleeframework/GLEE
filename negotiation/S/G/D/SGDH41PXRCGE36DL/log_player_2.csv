"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $8,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate in hopes of getting closer to his desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $10,500 for this product. It's a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still outside his ideal range.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and secures a good deal."
