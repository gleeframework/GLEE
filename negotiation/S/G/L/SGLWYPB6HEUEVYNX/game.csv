"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a fruitful negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my maximum spending limit, I'm offering $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's say $1,125,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal with you.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I respect that.  However, the product's value is firmly above $1,000,000.  I'm willing to consider $1,050,000 - my final offer.  This is a compromise, reflecting my desire to close a deal with you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
