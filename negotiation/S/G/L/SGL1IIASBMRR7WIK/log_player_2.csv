"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $900,000
* **Your value:** $1,000,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
