Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is a bit more than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value to Bob and use a positive tone to encourage a positive response.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm prepared to negotiate, so I'm not starting at my absolute minimum. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I can still potentially get a better price by counter-offering.  
* **John is a strong backup:** I'm confident that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage to be firm in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit above that.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but stay above minimum:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from $950,000 to $900,000, but this price is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, which I can get from John. 
* **Emphasizing the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product to justify the price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below $900,000.
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiation might take time and I'm not sure I can push Bob much higher. 
* **John offers certainty:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum.  This is a safe and certain outcome compared to the uncertainty of continued negotiations with Bob."
