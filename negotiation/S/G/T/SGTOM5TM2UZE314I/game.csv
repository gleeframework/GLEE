"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
