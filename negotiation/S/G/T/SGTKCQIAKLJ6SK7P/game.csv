"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in purchasing it for $9000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a price of $11000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for some flexibility on both sides.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you in the middle at $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I'm  closer to your price, $10500 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,6,
