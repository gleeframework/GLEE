"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This price is still fair for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
