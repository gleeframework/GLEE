"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John.  However, it is worth trying to get a better price from Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This price is still fair for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, $13,000 is still a good price for him, as it's lower than John's price."
