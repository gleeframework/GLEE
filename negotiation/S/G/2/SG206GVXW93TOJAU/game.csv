"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $18,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $19,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $17,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me.",17500.0,Bob,4,
