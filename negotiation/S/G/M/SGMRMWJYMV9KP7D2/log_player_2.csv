# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, considering its potential. I'm open to further discussion if this isn't a suitable starting point."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $1,000,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my target of $800,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to go up to $900,000.
