"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, considering its potential. I'm open to further discussion if this isn't a suitable starting point.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $1,000,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I value your willingness to negotiate.  While I appreciate the product's worth, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000, which represents a significant compromise for me.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
