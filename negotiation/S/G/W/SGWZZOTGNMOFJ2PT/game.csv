Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  Would you consider $9500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to work with me. While $10000 is closer, it's still a bit too high. Given the value of the product to me and the time remaining, I'm willing to offer $9000. I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while ensuring I get a great deal. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
