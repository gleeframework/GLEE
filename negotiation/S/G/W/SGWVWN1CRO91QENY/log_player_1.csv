Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the potential value the product offers for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers by inviting Bob to share his thoughts.
* **Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me the security to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** Bob's offer is at my minimum price. While I'm not losing money, there's no room for profit.
* **Potential for More:**  I believe the product is worth more.  There's a chance Bob may be willing to go higher with a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  By rejecting, I risk losing Bob completely, but I also have the opportunity to potentially earn more.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit below my desired price point. How about we split the difference at $17,500? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $17500, which would be $14750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** I've made two counteroffers and it seems like Bob is not willing to go higher. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take a lot of time, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.

**Conclusion:**

I've decided to sell to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which may not result in a better outcome."
