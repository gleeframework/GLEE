Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, leaving room for negotiation.  It's above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $950,000?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the difference, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and it seems like we're getting close to a deal.  While $920,000 is still significantly less than what I could get from John, it's a worthwhile compromise to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
