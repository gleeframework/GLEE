"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,250,000, you set a high anchor point, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" and ""unique opportunity,"" aiming to justify the high initial price.

**Important Considerations for Future Rounds:**

* **Bob's Response:** Pay close attention to how Bob reacts to this initial offer. His counteroffer (or lack thereof) will reveal a lot about his willingness to pay.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Remember, you have John as a backup buyer. If Bob's offers are too low or negotiations stall, you can always walk away and accept John's $1,500,000.
* **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust your price in subsequent rounds, but always aim to maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and your initial asking price. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob's offer indicates he's interested but trying to secure a price advantageous to him.  By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but not at such a low price.

**Strategy for Round 3:**

In the next round, you should present a counteroffer that is:

1. **Lower than your initial offer:**  Show some flexibility and willingness to move towards a compromise.
2. **Still significantly above Bob's offer:**  Don't drastically reduce your price, as this could make you appear desperate. Aim for a price closer to your minimum. 
3. **Justified (if possible):**  Consider providing a brief reason for the counteroffer, focusing on the product's value or the concessions you're making."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value and the significant benefits you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Reduction:**  The counteroffer of $1,900,000 is a significant decrease from the initial $2,250,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Above Minimum:**  The price remains well above your $1,500,000 minimum and John's standing offer, ensuring you're still in a strong position.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly pushing back on Bob's attempt to anchor the price lower. 

**Goal:** This counteroffer aims to bring Bob back to the negotiation table while still aiming for a price that yields a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stale Negotiation:** Bob is repeating his previous offer, indicating he might be inflexible or testing your resolve. 
* **Below Minimum:**  $1,250,000 is still significantly below your acceptable minimum. Accepting would mean a considerable loss.
* **Alternative Option:** You have John's offer of $1,500,000, which is more favorable than Bob's current position.

**Strategy for Round 5:**

It's time to signal that you're prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't increase his offer substantially. You can do this by:

1. **Smaller Counteroffer:** Reduce your counteroffer, but only slightly, to show you're still open to negotiation but not willing to accept a low price.
2. **Mention John:**  Subtly hint that you have other options available, increasing the perceived value of your product and putting pressure on Bob.
3. **Deadline (Optional):**  You could introduce a soft deadline for the next round, saying you need to make a decision soon due to other offers."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I have to be honest,  $1,250,000 is too far below what I can accept. I'm willing to consider $1,700,000, but I also have other interested buyers, and I need to make a decision soon. I believe this product can bring you a lot of value, so I hope we can find a way to make this work."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Reduction:** The counteroffer of $1,700,000 is a smaller reduction than before, signaling that you're nearing your bottom line.
* **Pressure Point:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" without explicitly naming John introduces a sense of competition and scarcity.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""need to make a decision soon"" adds a touch of urgency, encouraging Bob to be more decisive.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, expressing hope that a deal can still be reached.

**Goal:** This counteroffer aims to push Bob to significantly increase his offer while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,700,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price, considering the value I see in this product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Still Below Minimum:** Bob has increased his offer to $1,400,000, showing movement but still falling short of your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **John as Leverage:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum acceptable price. There's no need to settle for less.
* **Potential for More:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate and his latest increase suggest there might be room for him to go even higher.

**Strategy for Round 7:**

1. **Final Counteroffer:**  Present your absolute bottom line, making it clear this is your last offer. 
2. **Emphasize Value (Again):** Remind Bob of the unique value and benefits your product offers to justify the price.
3. **Prepare to Walk Away:**  Be fully ready to accept John's offer if Bob doesn't meet your final price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I've tried to find a compromise.  However,  I need to be upfront: $1,500,000 is my absolute lowest price.

**Goal:**  This counteroffer aims to secure a deal at your desired price while giving Bob a final chance to meet your terms. You're also mentally prepared to accept John's offer if Bob declines."
