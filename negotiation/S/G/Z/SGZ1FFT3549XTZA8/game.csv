"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $13,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,800. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13800.0,Alice,3,
