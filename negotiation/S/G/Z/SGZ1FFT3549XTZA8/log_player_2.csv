"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $13,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,800. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is still better than buying from John for $15,000.  Bob can save $1,200 by accepting this offer, and it's close enough to his ideal price of $13,000.  There's a chance he could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it for the potential savings."
