{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob rejects my offer. However, I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $120, so I don't want to start too high and risk losing him as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $155? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 155} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. While Bob's offer of $145 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to him to ensure I get my desired price."
