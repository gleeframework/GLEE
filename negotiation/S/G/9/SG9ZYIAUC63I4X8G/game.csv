"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant returns you stand to gain.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research and am confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  To move forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring a fair valuation.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise given our valuations. This allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the potential returns it offers. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,250,000, which I believe is more than fair given the unique benefits this product brings.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm at $950,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Bob,6,
