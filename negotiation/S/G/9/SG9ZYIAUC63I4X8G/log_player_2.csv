Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only offer $800,000 at this time.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research and am confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  To move forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring a fair valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice is moving in the right direction, $1,400,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise given our valuations. This allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the potential returns it offers. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,250,000, which I believe is more than fair given the unique benefits this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $1,250,000 is still too high.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm at $950,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 950000}
