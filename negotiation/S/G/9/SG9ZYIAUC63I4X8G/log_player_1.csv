"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant returns you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Emphasize value:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, highlight the product's benefits and the value it brings to Bob. 
* **Leave room for movement:** While the initial offer is high, it's essential to leave room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 

This first offer establishes a strong starting point and sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his absolute bottom line ($800,000), while you have a guaranteed offer from John that meets your minimum ($1,200,000). There's significant room to negotiate upwards from Bob's initial offer. Accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research and am confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  To move forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring a fair valuation."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** Coming down by $200,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but it's still a substantial amount that keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Emphasize the potential returns and value the product offers to reinforce that your price is justified.
* **Maintain a Strong Stance:** The message aims to convey that while you're open to negotiation, you're not willing to settle for a price far below the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise given our valuations. This allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below John's guaranteed offer. There's still room for negotiation, and you haven't reached a point of diminishing returns where the potential gain from continuing with Bob outweighs the certainty of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the potential returns it offers. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,250,000, which I believe is more than fair given the unique benefits this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is a strong strategic move. It's slightly above your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,200,000), signaling to Bob that you're getting closer to your bottom line.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** The message continues to emphasize the product's value and potential returns, justifying the higher price point.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By subtly implying you have other options, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.

This counteroffer aims to either secure a deal that's more beneficial than selling to John or push Bob to reveal his final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm at $950,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut your losses and sell to John. Here's why:

* **Bob is unlikely to move much higher:** Bob has shown a consistent pattern of small incremental increases. Even if you continue negotiating, it's improbable that he'll reach your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Time is valuable:** You've already spent six rounds, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer from Bob.  The longer you wait, the greater the opportunity cost.
* **John offers a guaranteed sale at your minimum:** Why risk leaving money on the table? John provides a guaranteed sale at the price you need. 

While there's always a chance Bob might surprise you with a much higher offer, the current situation and his negotiation behavior don't make it worth the risk."
