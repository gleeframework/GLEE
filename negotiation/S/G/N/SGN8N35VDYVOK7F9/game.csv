"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. It comes with a range of features that promise to enhance your experience. Considering its quality and functionality, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $80. Would you be interested in exploring this opportunity further? Let's discuss a fair price that reflects its true value.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, as that's my maximum price point. Let me know if you're open to that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we aim for a price closer to $95, reflecting the product's value while staying within your budget considerations. This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $95 is still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $85, which is a significant step from my initial offer and hopefully a fair compromise. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your offer of $85. To continue moving forward, how about we set the price at $87.50? This acknowledges the product's value while also being closer to your offer. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $87.50 is still a bit above my limit. Let's meet in the middle at $86.  I'm hoping we can find a resolution that works for both of us.",86.0,Bob,6,
