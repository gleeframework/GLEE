Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible since that's the maximum he's willing to pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit above our minimum ($10,000). 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John who will buy the product for $10,000. This allows us to be a bit bolder with our initial offer to Bob. 

By starting high but still within a reasonable range, we increase our chances of securing a deal that's highly favorable for us."
