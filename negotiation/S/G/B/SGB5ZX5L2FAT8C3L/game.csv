"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price point.

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
