Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider this price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price.  The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so I'm not willing to sell it for that amount yet. I have 9 rounds left to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm still confident this product is worth more. Let's split the difference. How about $15,000?  That's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer for $13,500. This is a decent price, and I'm happy to close the deal. While I'm still confident the product is worth more, it's getting close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
