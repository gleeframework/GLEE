"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $60. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I want to see if we can make a deal. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $130 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, considering the price I have in mind."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $75 is closer to what you're looking for, it's still quite a bit below my bottom line.  To be honest, I have another offer for close to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle at $100? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $100, and her claiming another offer strengthens her position. It's better to secure the product at $80 from John than to risk Alice walking away and potentially ending up with nothing."
