"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I want to see if we can make a deal. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $130 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, considering the price I have in mind.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $75 is closer to what you're looking for, it's still quite a bit below my bottom line.  To be honest, I have another offer for close to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle at $100? This is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
