Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'll make a small adjustment and counteroffer at $1,325,500. This is a very close price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated the price down to $1,325,500, a savings of $174,500 from Alice's original offer and well below John's price.
* **Small Difference:**  Alice is clearly trying to hold on to a little extra, but the difference between your last offer and hers is only $500. It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal. 
* **Time Investment:** Continuing the negotiation might not yield a significantly better price and risks Alice becoming less willing to negotiate."
