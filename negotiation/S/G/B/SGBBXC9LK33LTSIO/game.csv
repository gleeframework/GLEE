"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the initial offer you made.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. However, $1,450,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,575,000. This is my final offer.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,575,000 is still not acceptable to me. I'm willing to pay $1,425,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the initial offer you made.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting caught up in the back and forth.  I need to be upfront â€“ my bottom line is $1,500,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product.  Take it or leave it.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a bottom line, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and my previous offer of $1,425,000, which is $1,462,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value you've placed on the product.",1462500.0,Bob,8,
