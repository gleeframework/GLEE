Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price slightly above that, leaving some room for Alice to negotiate but still saving Bob a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay initially. While the time is ticking, Bob still has room to negotiate and hopes to get closer to his desired price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget and pushing for a better deal.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward and demonstrates that he's serious about acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what he's aiming for. With time running out, Bob wants to try one more counteroffer to see if he can reach an agreement.  He's not quite ready to purchase from John yet, as he believes he can still get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer again, but still leaving some room for negotiation. He's trying to find a middle ground with Alice, knowing that time is running out and he needs to make a decision soon. He's hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation is getting close to the end, and Alice's offer is nearing Bob's maximum budget. Although Bob still has two more rounds to make a counteroffer, the risk is too high. He has already made several counteroffers and it's uncertain if Alice will accept any further concessions. 

Accepting the offer at $13,500 is a good compromise, allowing Bob to buy the product at a price that's still within his budget and saving him $1,500 compared to buying from John."
