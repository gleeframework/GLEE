"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the [product name], but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125? That's a fair compromise, I think. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $112.50? It would be a fair deal for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
