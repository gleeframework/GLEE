Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $150 to Bob, giving you significant room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer above that is profit.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Aiming for a price around $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still offering Bob a price that's significantly lower than his perceived value. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential earnings while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
