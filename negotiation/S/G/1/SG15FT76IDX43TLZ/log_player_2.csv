"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that will bring you great value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness in buying the product while also staying within your budget. It leaves room for further negotiation but avoids being immediately rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price point. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit lower, as you are still within the initial negotiation stage. You have enough rounds remaining to attempt a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This feels like a fair price point that considers the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway but still maintains some wiggle room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,750. This is a bit closer to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make a concession to finalize the deal. Let's see if we can get it done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum budget, but it's still a bit higher than what you are willing to pay. You have enough rounds left to try and negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice down to your target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $10,750 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a final price that works for both of us. My final offer is $10,250.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a strong push to close the deal. It's a relatively small compromise from Alice's last offer, but it still allows you to potentially secure the product for slightly less than your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's final offer of $10,500 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. While you could continue negotiating, you have only three rounds left, and the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  It's more beneficial to secure the product from John at your target price of $10,000, guaranteeing you the best possible deal."
