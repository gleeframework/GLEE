"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll end up closer to your target.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, you aim to influence Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrasing like ""starting price"" and ""what do you think?"" signals your willingness to negotiate, making Bob more inclined to engage. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space for a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $1,000,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and the product's value to him. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is always an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** Showing you heard and considered his offer encourages continued negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message reiterates the product's worth while demonstrating flexibility with a substantial price reduction.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** $1,750,000 is a strong counteroffer. It's a significant decrease from your initial ask, but still well above both your minimum and Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me a bit, that price is still a little too high for my budget. Could we possibly settle around  $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to his true valuation, but he's still significantly below your minimum. While $1,250,000 is a tempting profit, there's likely room for him to go higher. We're not in a rush, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing some progress here, but we're still a ways off.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** Acknowledging ""progress"" keeps the tone positive despite the rejection.
* **Firm Stand:**  Stating  ""$1,600,000 is as low as I can go"" creates a sense of urgency and finality, pushing Bob to be more serious. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Reiterating the product's benefits reminds Bob why he's interested and justifies the price.

This counteroffer balances firmness with a desire to reach an agreement.  It allows for one more round of potential concessions from Bob before Alice has to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,600,000 is still stretching my budget. I can do $1,350,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut our losses. Here's why:

* **Bob's Limit:** He's signaled that $1,350,000 is his ""absolute limit.""  While he could go slightly higher, it's unlikely to be a significant jump.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of a stalemate or a deal barely above his current offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than Bob is currently offering and eliminates further negotiation.

While there's a slim chance of squeezing a bit more out of Bob, the risk outweighs the potential reward. John's offer ensures a profitable and quick sale."
