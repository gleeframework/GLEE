Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer significantly exceeds Bob's perceived value. However, it allows you to gauge his interest and flexibility. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high price leaves room for negotiation. You can always come down, especially if Bob provides strong counter-arguments.
* **Maximizing Profit:** If Bob accepts, you gain a substantial profit beyond your minimum. If he rejects, you still have your fallback option with John."
