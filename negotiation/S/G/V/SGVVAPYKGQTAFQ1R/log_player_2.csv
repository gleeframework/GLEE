Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to acquire this product at a slightly lower point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum. It shows you're serious about negotiating but leaves room for compromise.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message emphasizes finding ""common ground,"" implying a willingness to work together. 
* **Sets a clear expectation:** This counteroffer establishes a specific price point, making it easier for Alice to respond."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposal is to offer the product at $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above her minimum:** While Alice has lowered her price, she's still offering $1,300,000, which is above her minimum of $1,200,000.  This means there's still room to push for a better price.
* **You have a strong alternative:**  Remember, you can still buy from John for $1,500,000.  This gives you a solid fallback option.
* **Continue negotiating:**  There's a good chance Alice will come down further.  By rejecting, you signal that you're not settling for the current price.

**Next steps:** You should make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your desired range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm ready to finalize the purchase at $1,275,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer of $1,250,000 and Alice's current offer of $1,300,000. This shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fairness and closure:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" and ""closing the deal,"" highlighting the benefits of reaching an agreement.
* **Continuing momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward without being overly aggressive."
