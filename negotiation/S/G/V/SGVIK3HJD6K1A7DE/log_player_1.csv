"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort in adjusting your offer. However, based on my research and budget considerations, I am unable to agree to $105. I would like to propose $98 as my maximum offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher than $98.  Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation."
