"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget and need to be careful with my expenses. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I can offer you the product for $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to acquire the product within your budget.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still working within a tight budget, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is the lowest I can go, but it's still a significant discount from my original asking price.  Let's finalize this deal.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
