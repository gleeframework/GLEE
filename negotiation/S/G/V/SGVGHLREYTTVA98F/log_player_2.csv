It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is clearly not going to budge much more, and at this point, the potential savings of a few thousand dollars aren't worth the risk of her ending the negotiation altogether. You have a guaranteed option for $1,000,000, and it's wiser to take that than to gamble on getting a slightly better price from Alice."
