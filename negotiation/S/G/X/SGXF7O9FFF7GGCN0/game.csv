"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll be impressed. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit of a stretch for me at $1800000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I can meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1600000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. Can we meet at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm proposing a price of $1600000 is too high, so I'll meet you at $1550000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1550000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of that number, so I'm proposing $1525000. Can we meet at this price?",1525000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm proposing a price of $1525000 is a bit low for me, so I'll meet you at $1525500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1525500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1520000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm proposing a price of $1520500.

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",1500000.0,Bob,10,
