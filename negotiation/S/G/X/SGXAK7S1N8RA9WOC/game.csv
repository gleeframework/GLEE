"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This price takes into account your willingness to compromise, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
