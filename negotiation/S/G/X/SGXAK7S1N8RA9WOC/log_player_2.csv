"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This price takes into account your willingness to compromise, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While you can still try to negotiate a lower price, Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  You're closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible, and there's a risk that further negotiation could backfire. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
