Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  Let me know if you're interested, this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still above your minimum. 
* **Time Limit:** Adding a time limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

**Important:**  This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting your offer. You have a safety net with John, but there's always a chance for a higher profit with Bob."
