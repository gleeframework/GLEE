"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $95 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $90. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
