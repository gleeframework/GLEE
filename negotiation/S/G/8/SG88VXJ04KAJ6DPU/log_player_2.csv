It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a lower price than $95."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $90. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $90, which is within your budget and a better price than John's offer.  It's worth accepting and finalizing the purchase."
