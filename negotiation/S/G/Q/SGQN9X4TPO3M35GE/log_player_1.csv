"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and slightly above what I think Bob might be willing to pay. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message to build rapport. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies that I am open to negotiation, but still setting a firm price point. 
* **Testing the waters:** This first round is about gauging Bob's interest and understanding his potential bargaining range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's interest is encouraging, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Holding out for a better offer:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a decrease:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not conceding too much. 
* **Justification for the price:**  I'm providing a reason for the price to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm staying polite and encouraging to keep the negotiation going. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is designed to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have several rounds left, and I'm not under any immediate pressure to sell.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  I'm hoping that by rejecting Bob's offer, I can push him to increase his bid even further or potentially secure a deal with John for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference and settle for $135. How does that sound to you?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise by meeting Bob halfway again. 
* **Specific price:**  I'm offering a specific price to avoid further back-and-forth. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging. 
* **Pushing towards the minimum:**  This offer is getting closer to my minimum price while leaving some room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're at round 6, and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price of $150.
* **John's offer is better:**  I can secure a guaranteed sale with John for $150, which is significantly more than Bob's current offer of $125. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, there's a risk that he'll continue to decline my offers. Selling to John guarantees a profit and eliminates the uncertainty."
