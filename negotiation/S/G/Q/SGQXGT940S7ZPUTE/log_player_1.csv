Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you, for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming high initially allows Alice to potentially capture the most value from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Alternative Exists:** Alice has a fallback option with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation and the security of a backup buyer."
