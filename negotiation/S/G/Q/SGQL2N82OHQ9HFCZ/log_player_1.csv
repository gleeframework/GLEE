"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's valuation but leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and encourages him to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because it's still below my desired price. While I'm starting to get closer to my target, I believe I can still achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum desired price.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal while leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me, as it matches my minimum desired price.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer."
