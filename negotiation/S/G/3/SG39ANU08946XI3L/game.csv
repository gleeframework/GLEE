"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $11,500, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's a significant discount from my initial price and still leaves me with a decent profit. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",12800.0,Bob,4,
