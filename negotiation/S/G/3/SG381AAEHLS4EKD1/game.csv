"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the features of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given its value to me, I'd be willing to offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the quality and unique features of the product, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer of $10,000, but I would need to add some incentives to make the deal more appealing to both of us.
