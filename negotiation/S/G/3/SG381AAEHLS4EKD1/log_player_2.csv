"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. It comes with advanced features that can significantly enhance your experience. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I would like to propose an offer of $12,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming for a price below $15,000, and $12,000 is still significantly higher than Alice's value of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation is worth trying.** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  If negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the features of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given its value to me, I'd be willing to offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the quality and unique features of the product, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer of $10,000, but I would need to add some incentives to make the deal more appealing to both of us. Would you be interested in a package deal that includes an extended warranty for free if you agree to purchase the product for $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your acceptable range.** $10,500 is below your $15,000 limit.
* **The extended warranty is a bonus.**  It adds value to the deal even though it doesn't directly lower the price.
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal.** While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become more resistant, and you might end up paying more or losing the deal altogether. 

This offer is a good compromise, allowing you to get the product at a reasonable price while also benefiting from the added warranty."
