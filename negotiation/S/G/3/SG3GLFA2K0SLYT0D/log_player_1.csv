Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, implying it's a good deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hardline price, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Plan B:**  If the negotiation stalls or Bob is too stubborn, I can always go with John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **There's potential to negotiate.**  While Bob's offer is low, his interest in the product is clear. I can try to push him closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a reliable backup.** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not losing out by rejecting Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still holding firm to my minimum acceptable price. The counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to maintain a good rapport with Bob. This increases the chance of him accepting the offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** The price is still above Bob's initial offer, suggesting I'm not desperate to sell. This keeps some negotiating power on my side. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? It's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum.** While it's still below my desired price of $12,000, it's only $1,000 less than my minimum. 
* **Negotiation is getting lengthy.**  We're already on the fourth round of negotiation, and the chances of getting a higher offer from Bob are slim.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** I can always sell to John for $12,000 if this deal falls through.  
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiations leading to a rejection. It's better to secure a slightly lower price than risk losing the sale altogether."
