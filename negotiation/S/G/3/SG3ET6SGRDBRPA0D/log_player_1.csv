Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer sets a price higher than your minimum value, hoping to maximize your earnings.  However, it's a calculated risk. If Bob rejects, you're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 

This strategy balances the desire for a higher profit with the security of a guaranteed sale.  You can adjust the price depending on how confident you are in Bob's potential valuation of the product."
