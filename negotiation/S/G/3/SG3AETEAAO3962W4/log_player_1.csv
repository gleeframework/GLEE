Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I believe $900,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth. What do you say?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to offer $875,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob's final offer of $875,000 is a substantial amount and well above my minimum. It's risky to decline and potentially lose him as a buyer, especially with his final offer statement. Accepting ensures a profitable deal."
