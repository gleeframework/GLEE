"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely do better than $12,000.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and you are willing to pay up to $15,000. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring your counteroffer options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects, while still being a decent deal for you, as you're still willing to pay more than the product is worth to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer. You have 7 rounds left, so you're not under pressure to accept right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're moving closer to a middle ground.  This offer is a small increase from your previous counteroffer, showing that you're willing to compromise while still trying to keep the price lower. It also gives Alice a bit of room to counter if she wants to meet in the middle."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are aiming for. You are willing to pay more than the product's worth to Alice but you can still negotiate a better price. There are still 5 rounds left and the opportunity to find a deal that's beneficial to both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases your price slightly but keeps it well under Alice's offer. It shows you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum, it's still above your target. You have only 3 rounds remaining, but it's worth continuing the negotiation.  A counteroffer with a slight increase from your previous offer could help you meet in the middle and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant increase from your previous offer but still below Alice's offer. It demonstrates your willingness to compromise and meet in the middle. With only two rounds remaining, you're taking a bolder step to try and finalize a deal. This counteroffer also leaves room for Alice to make a final counteroffer if she is willing to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though we're in the 9th round, there's still one round left, and you're not obligated to accept Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to your max, you can still try to get a slightly better price. 

* **You are only $500 away from your maximum price.**  This is a small enough difference that one more round of negotiation might get Alice to accept your offer.

* **If Alice rejects, you can always buy from John.** This is a safety net, so you have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final offer. It's a significant increase from your previous counteroffer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise and finalize the deal. You are only $1,000 away from Alice's offer, leaving room for a possible counteroffer. If Alice rejects, you will have no choice but to buy from John, but this last counteroffer is a final attempt to secure the product at a lower price."
