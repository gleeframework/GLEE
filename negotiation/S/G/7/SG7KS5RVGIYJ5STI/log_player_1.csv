Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll have to consider whether his counteroffer is worth pursuing or if I should just sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, since John is also willing to pay the same price, I'm choosing to sell to John. This ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids any further negotiation."
