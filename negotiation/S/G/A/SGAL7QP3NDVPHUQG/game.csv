"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider taking $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $775,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $775,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $725,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
