Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $95 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $100, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** Showing confidence in your product's value can encourage Bob to accept. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to your minimum, rejecting Bob's offer is the best strategy in this situation. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** You've already shown that you're willing to negotiate. Rejecting Bob's offer lets him know you're not desperate and encourages him to raise his offer.
* **Keeping some leverage:** You still have a safety net with John's offer of $80.  This gives you flexibility to counter Bob's offer.
* **Showing your value:** By rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer, you demonstrate the product's value and your willingness to stand your ground. 

Let's see if you can get a better price from Bob!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $85 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $95. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair compromise that lets us both get what we want."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above your minimum:** $90 is still above your minimum of $80, ensuring you're making a profit.
* **Show flexibility:**  By splitting the difference, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Maintain a strong position:** This counteroffer shows that you're serious about selling to Bob, but you're not willing to settle for a price that's too low. 

Let's see if Bob will accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we try $87.50? That's closer to my target and still a bit more than what I was initially thinking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd ideally like to get closer to your initial $95, it's time to accept Bob's offer of $87.5. Here's why:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $87.5 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you're still making a profit.
* **Closing the deal:** Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away, and you don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  The potential gain from further negotiation is minimal compared to the risk of losing a buyer. 

It's a good outcome, and you've successfully managed to sell the product for a price that's close to your initial target!"
