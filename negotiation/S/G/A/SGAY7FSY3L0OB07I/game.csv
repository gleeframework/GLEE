,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $105 is closer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  How about $108?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",108.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $108.  Let's meet in the middle at $106.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",106.0,Bob,4,
