"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $10,000. This is an excellent opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a discounted rate. I believe it aligns well with your needs and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than Alice's value of $8,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given your interest in the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $9,500? This still allows for a good return on my investment while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price:** $9,500 is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer of $9,000.
* **It's a good deal compared to John:** Buying from John would cost $12,000, significantly more than $9,500.
* **No guarantee of a better deal:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get Bob a lower price. He risks losing the deal altogether if he keeps rejecting offers.

While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting $9,500 is the most logical decision given the circumstances."
