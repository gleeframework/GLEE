Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you want to start high to maximize your potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, even though you know it's worth less to Bob intrinsically.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to create the impression of value and scarcity. If Bob accepts the $1,350,000, you make a significant profit above his perceived value. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with John, your guaranteed buyer."
