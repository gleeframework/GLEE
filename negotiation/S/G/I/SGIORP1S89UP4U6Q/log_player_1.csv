{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

This offer starts with a friendly message and offers a price that is slightly lower than what Bob is willing to pay, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and understand its value. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $8,500?  This is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses lower. Could we possibly agree on $7,500 for the product? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Since I'm not willing to go lower, I'll sell the product to John for $8,000, which is still a good deal for me."
