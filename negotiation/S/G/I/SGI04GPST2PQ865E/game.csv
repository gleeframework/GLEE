"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, considering my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet halfway, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could find a more suitable price. I am proposing $8,750 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits.",8750.0,Bob,4,
