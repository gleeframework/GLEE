{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum desired price. This allows for some room for negotiation without immediately risking a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, considering my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet halfway, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could find a more suitable price. I am proposing $8,750 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. It seems like Bob is unwilling to budge further.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
