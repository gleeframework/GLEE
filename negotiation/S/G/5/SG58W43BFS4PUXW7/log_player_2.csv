"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but it's still possible to get a better deal. We don't know Alice's minimum price, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows us to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 22% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows a strong desire to negotiate and establishes a starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my initial counteroffer. I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down $50,000 from her last offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm increasing my counteroffer by $50,000, meeting her halfway. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my last counteroffer.  I've already demonstrated my willingness to negotiate, and further rejecting could risk losing the deal altogether. $825,000 is a significant saving compared to buying from John, making it a worthwhile purchase."
