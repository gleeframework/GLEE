"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your consideration of the product's value. However, I believe it's worth more than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1750000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1750000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's my final offer. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of the product's long-term value and the potential returns it could bring. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to your business.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1650000. I'm starting to think that we might be at an impasse. However, I'm still open to finding a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $1725000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1725000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1725000 is still out of my price range.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1650000.  It's the best I can do. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",1650000.0,Bob,8,
