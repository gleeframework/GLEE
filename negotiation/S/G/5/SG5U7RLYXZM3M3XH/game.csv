"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep for you. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $11,000?  That's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
