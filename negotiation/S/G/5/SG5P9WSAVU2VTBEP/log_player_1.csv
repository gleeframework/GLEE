Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to meet me somewhere in the middle.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm not willing to accept his offer. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a compromise, still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would have liked to sell for more, accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on a sale and achieve my minimum target."
