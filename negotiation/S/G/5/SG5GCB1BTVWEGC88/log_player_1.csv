"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to close the deal at this point, I'm only a couple hundred dollars away from my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if I can get closer to my target."
