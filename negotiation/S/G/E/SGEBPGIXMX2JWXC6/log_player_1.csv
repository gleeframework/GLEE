Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** We start by aiming high, trying to get Bob closer to his maximum perceived value. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit.
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a strong backup plan with John, ensuring we don't need to settle for less than $10,000."
