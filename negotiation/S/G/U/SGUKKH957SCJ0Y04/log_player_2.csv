"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1300000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,300,000 vs. $1,200,000).  This suggests there is room for negotiation.  I can aim for a lower price to maximize my savings.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is not a good option as it's above my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, showing my commitment to getting a good deal. However, it's still within the range where Alice can make a profit ($1,150,000 is above her desired price of $1,200,000). 
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes my interest in the product while establishing my price point.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The question ""What do you think?"" keeps the dialogue open and allows for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1150000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1250000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for me.  It's closer to my initial counteroffer and well within my budget.  It's not ideal, but I can save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price in future rounds."
