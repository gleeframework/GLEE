# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a discount from the product's true worth, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is within his price range."
