**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still above your budget of $800,000, but closer to your counteroffer. It's worth continuing negotiations to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't go as low as $950,000.  To move things along, I'd be willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.
