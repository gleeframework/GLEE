Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $9000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little over my budget at $8500.  How about $8250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's slightly lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum threshold and a good deal for both of us.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000 and there are still 6 rounds left, giving us room for potential future negotiations if needed."
