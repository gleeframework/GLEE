"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product is still higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $980,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and represents a fair deal for both of us. ",980000.0,Alice,5,
