"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's willing to pay up to $800,000, so rejecting the offer allows him to start a counter-negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects my desire to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. He's willing to pay up to $800,000, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get closer to his target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product is still higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $980,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and represents a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $980,000, this is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Since there's a known alternative at a price he can afford, Bob is best served by accepting John's offer and buying the product from him."
