"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $115 for it.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $125. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it from you.",120.0,Bob,4,
