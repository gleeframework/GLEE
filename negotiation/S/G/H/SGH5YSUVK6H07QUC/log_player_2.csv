"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can potentially save more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price. You still have the option to buy from John for $120 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $100. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to Alice and $120 to me. It gives Alice a profit and still allows me to save some money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is a good price, as it's still lower than what I'd pay John. While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer again, and I'll have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product for a good price and avoids further negotiation risk."
