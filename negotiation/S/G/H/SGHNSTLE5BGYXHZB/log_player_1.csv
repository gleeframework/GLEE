Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and market value. I'm willing to walk away if this price isn't acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
