Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your ideal price point, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $8,000. I can sell the product to you for $8,400. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400

``` 

Alice has met you halfway and is unlikely to go much lower.  Accepting the $8,400 offer secures a good price for you and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
