"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount to your business.  While I'm not comfortable disclosing the specific details of the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1 million to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that allows me to earn a decent profit while giving you a substantial saving.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
