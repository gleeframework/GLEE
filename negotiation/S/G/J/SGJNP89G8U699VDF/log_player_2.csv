Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of her walking away. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price."
