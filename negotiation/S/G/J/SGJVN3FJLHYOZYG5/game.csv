"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, let's try to make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
