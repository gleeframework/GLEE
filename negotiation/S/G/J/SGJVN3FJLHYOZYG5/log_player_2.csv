"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but Bob should try to lower the price.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate. It's not a ridiculous lowball offer, so Alice is more likely to consider it.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves room for both parties to compromise and meet in the middle.
* **Building a Relationship:**  The message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing Bob's budget constraints. This helps build a positive rapport for continued negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,100,000 is still above Bob's preferred price point. He's still got some room to negotiate, and it's worth trying to get the price even lower.  He can likely get closer to his goal of $1,000,000 by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bold but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's previous offer, but it's justified by stating it's Bob's ""absolute maximum."" It creates a sense of urgency and finality.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the fair value of the product at $1,000,000 reinforces Bob's position.
* **Win-Win Scenario:** The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, appealing to Alice's desire to close the deal."
