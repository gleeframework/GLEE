Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.

I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal.
