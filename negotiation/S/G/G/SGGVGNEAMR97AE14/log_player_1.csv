Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $120.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** Bob is still getting a good deal, as the product is worth $150 to him.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's space to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer. 

This strategy gives you a chance to maximize your profits while keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting closer to Bob's $150 value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $150. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is more than your minimum of $120, it's still significantly less than your initial offer of $140, and there's still a good amount of space between Bob's offer and what the product is worth to him. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad you're open to meeting halfway. However, I'm still looking to keep my budget tight. Could we perhaps aim for $130? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has remained firm on his desired price of $130, it's important to consider the following:

* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's a chance that if you reject Bob's offer again, he might not be willing to budge any further. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  If you reject Bob's offer and he walks away, you'll have to sell to John for $120, which is a lower price.
* **Value for Bob:**  $130 is still a good price for Bob, as the product is worth $150 to him.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's higher than your minimum and acceptable to both parties. It minimizes the risk of losing the deal and securing a profit."
