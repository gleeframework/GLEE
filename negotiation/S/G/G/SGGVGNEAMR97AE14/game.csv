"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $150. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad you're open to meeting halfway. However, I'm still looking to keep my budget tight. Could we perhaps aim for $130? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
