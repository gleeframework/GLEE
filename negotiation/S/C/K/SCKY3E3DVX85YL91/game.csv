,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,500. Would that work for you?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 represents a fair price for the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I could meet you halfway at $8,750. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
