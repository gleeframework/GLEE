"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a price of $9,500. I believe this product would be very beneficial for you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price, closer to her value of $8,000.  It's worth seeing if we can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** We start significantly lower than Alice's offer but still comfortably above her perceived value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:** We maintain a friendly tone while being clear about our budget limitations. 
* **Justification:** We provide a reason for the counteroffer (""too high for me"") without revealing too much about our willingness to pay more.

This approach aims to bring Alice closer to a more agreeable price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 represents a fair price for the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is negotiating:**  The fact Alice came down in price, even calling it her ""final offer,"" suggests she's willing to negotiate further.
* **Still room for improvement:** $9,000 is still a significant markup from her $8,000 valuation. 
* **John is our backup:**  We have the safety net of buying from John for $10,000, so we're not desperate yet.

It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I could meet you halfway at $8,750. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** We're suggesting a compromise by meeting Alice exactly in the middle of the current price gap. This demonstrates our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant saving.
* **Fairness emphasis:**  By phrasing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we subtly appeal to Alice's sense of reciprocity and potential desire to close the deal.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer represents a strong but reasonable last attempt to secure a price closer to our target. If Alice rejects this, we can still fall back on buying from John."
