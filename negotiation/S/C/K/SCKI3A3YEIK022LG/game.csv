"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $108. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $108. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider a price of $104?,104.0,Bob,6,
