"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but not ideal.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering $9,500.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a lower price by counter-offering. 

It's always worth trying to negotiate for a better price, especially when you have an alternative (John) that's less desirable but still available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000. 
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:** This gives Alice some room to negotiate if she wants to make a counter-offer, but still puts the pressure on her to come down in price. 
* **Balance Between Savings and Potential Loss:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can still go to John, but you'll be paying a higher price. This offer balances the risk of losing the product with the potential for significant savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is worse than her initial offer.**  She's gone up in price, which is not in your favor. 
* **Still room for negotiation.** While Alice is getting closer to your maximum, you can likely still get a better price.  
* **Risk of losing the deal is increasing.**  Each round increases the chances Alice will get frustrated and walk away, forcing you to buy from John.  

By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you continue to try to reach a mutually acceptable price without taking the risk of buying from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's latest offer of $9,700.
* **Still a good deal:**  $9,000 is significantly less than what you're willing to pay to John, and it's more than Alice's minimum value.
* **Increased pressure on Alice:**  This offer shows your commitment to getting a deal, but also highlights the potential of walking away if she's not willing to compromise. 

Hopefully, this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse:**  Each round, Alice is increasing her price, showing a lack of willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of losing the deal is high:**  With each rejected counteroffer, the chance of Alice walking away increases, and you'll be left with only John as an option. 
* **Cost difference is significant:** The difference between John's price and Alice's is $2,200. While not ideal, it's a smaller difference than the original $3,500, and you're already close to your maximum.

At this point, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high, and the potential savings are no longer worth the hassle.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at a slightly higher price but avoids the potential of a complete negotiation breakdown."
