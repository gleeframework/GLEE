"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no immediate reason to accept, and there's always the chance to negotiate a better deal.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price shows your willingness to negotiate while leaving room for compromise. This initial counteroffer provides a clear starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1050000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price by $150,000, showing her willingness to negotiate.  While it's not your ideal price, accepting her offer at $1,050,000 saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal with some room for savings, so it's worth accepting."
