"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1000000 for the product. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000 for the product. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1150000. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but I'm willing to be flexible. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
