"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's talk.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $800,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows us to both benefit from this deal.  Let's keep the conversation going.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. It's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us. Let's get this deal done.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,200,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground to close this deal.  We're getting close, let's find a way to make it work.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
