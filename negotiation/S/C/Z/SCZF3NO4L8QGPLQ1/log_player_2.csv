"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice first. There's a potential to save a lot more than buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer, making this a good deal for Bob. Buying from John would cost Bob $15,000, while Alice is now offering it for $11,500.  This is a solid compromise, and Bob should take advantage of this deal."
