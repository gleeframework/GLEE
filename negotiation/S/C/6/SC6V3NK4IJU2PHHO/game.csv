"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $10,500?  This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
