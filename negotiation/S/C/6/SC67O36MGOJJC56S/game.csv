"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,150,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However,  $1,075,000 is still a significant gap from what I consider a fair price. I'm open to moving a bit further, but this needs to make sense for both of us. My final offer is $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to move towards a compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you reconsider?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
