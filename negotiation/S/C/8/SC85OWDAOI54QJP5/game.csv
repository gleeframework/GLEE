"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see the product's value.  I'm willing to negotiate, however.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm feeling more comfortable around $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to $975,000 for this to make sense for me. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",975000.0,Alice,5,
