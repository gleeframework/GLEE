Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering the product at $9,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing the offer as a potential benefit to Bob, highlighting the value he might gain.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussing the price.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
