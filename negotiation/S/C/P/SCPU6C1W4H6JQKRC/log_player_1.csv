Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my asking price.  $9,000 is too low for me at this point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,500. This product is worth a lot to me, and I think $10,500 is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's a bit lower than I hoped, it's only $200 below my minimum, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting offers, I'll end up selling to John for my minimum and lose out on a potential higher price.  It's important to close the deal and secure a profit."
