"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price, as it still gives you a substantial value for the product.  Let's work together to find a compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price, and it's a significant step towards closing the deal. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
