"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, considering your interest.  Let's find a middle ground.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? This is my final offer.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $125.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $125 is still a bit too much.  How about we settle on $120? It's a fair price for both of us and avoids further negotiation.",120.0,Bob,6,
