Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but below my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer (John) introduces a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:** While not revealing my minimum price, I am hinting at the product's value beyond Bob's estimation to justify the higher price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I get a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for a back-and-forth. I can gauge his willingness to pay and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Bob Rejects:**  No problem. I have John as a reliable backup to buy at my minimum acceptable price."
