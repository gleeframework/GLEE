"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. $120 is still above your maximum budget of $150, and you haven't even started negotiating. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** You want to save as much as possible, so starting with a lower price than Alice's initial offer makes sense.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $105 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still allows for some room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Space:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter back, keeping the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $115 is a reasonable compromise, within your budget and closer to your initial counteroffer. 
* **Time Constraint:** You have a limited number of rounds, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price or a deal falling through."
