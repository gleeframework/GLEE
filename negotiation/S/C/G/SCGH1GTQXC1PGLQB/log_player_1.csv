{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $105. This is still above his initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, we can close the deal this round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum. I'm not confident I can get a better deal with him, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds. I'm going to sell to John for $120, which is a guaranteed profit and satisfies my minimum price."
