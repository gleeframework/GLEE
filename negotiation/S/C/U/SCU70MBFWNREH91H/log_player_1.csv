Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product without explicitly stating why it's worth that much to Bob. This allows him to justify the price in his own mind potentially.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is positive and invites Bob's input (""What do you think?""), signaling a willingness to negotiate.  

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging Bob has the final say and might negotiate for a lower price."
