"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still higher than your ideal price. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it makes sense to try and get a better price.  You'll likely need to make counteroffers to get down to a price you're happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price if we keep talking."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input. I understand your budget constraints, but given the value of the product, I believe it's worth a bit more. My counteroffer is $725,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You're confident that you can get a better price, and you have several rounds left.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $700,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $712,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 712500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. My counteroffer is $715,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $715,000 is very close to your desired price of $700,000.  You've already negotiated for a few rounds, and with only 5 rounds left, it's likely that further negotiation will only yield small incremental gains.  Accepting this offer saves you time and ensures a good deal."
