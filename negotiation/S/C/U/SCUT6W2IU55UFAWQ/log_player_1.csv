Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price is not unrealistic, giving Bob a chance to make a counteroffer that I can consider. 
* **Protecting My Value:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to consider his counteroffer, but I will always have the option of selling to John for my minimum price. 

This strategy allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum while keeping my options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal. I want to try to get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $1,200,000 and my initial offer of $1,500,000. This will keep the negotiation moving and give me the best chance of getting a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $1,200,000 and my previous offer of $1,500,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial goal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied.  
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still well above my minimum of $1,000,000, protecting my value. 

By taking this approach, I'm showing flexibility while still working towards a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is very close to my initial target price of $1,350,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, or even a rejection by Bob, which would force me to sell to John for a significantly lower price. 
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting this offer means closing the deal and getting the money quickly, saving time and effort in further negotiation.

While I would have preferred my initial target price, accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures a good deal."
