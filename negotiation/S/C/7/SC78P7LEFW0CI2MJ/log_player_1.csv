Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also demonstrates the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up in price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  Since it's higher than John's offer and I'm getting closer to my target, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,250,000."
