"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $14,000. I believe this product will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is starting at $14,000, but the product is only worth $12,000 to her. This suggests there's room to negotiate a lower price.
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a backup who will sell you the product for $15,000. This gives you leverage, as you don't absolutely *need* to buy from Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Unreasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's asking price, but it's still above her perceived value of the product ($12,000). 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves space for further negotiation. Alice might counter, and you can still go up while staying below your $15,000 limit.
* **Polite and Professional:** The tone remains respectful and expresses continued interest, which is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is too low.  Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice rejected your offer but came down in price, indicating she's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Getting Closer:**  $13,000 is getting closer to a price you're likely comfortable with, especially considering your $15,000 backup option. 
* **Strategic Counter:** By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing Alice to lower her price further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($10,500) and Alice's current offer ($13,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $11,500 puts you in a strong negotiating position. It's a reasonable increase from your previous offer and a significant decrease from Alice's original asking price.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  The tone remains friendly and collaborative, which is key to reaching a mutually agreeable outcome."
