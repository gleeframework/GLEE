Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's high enough to give me a good profit, but low enough that Bob is likely to consider it since he values the product at $1,500,000. 

It's important to keep in mind that:

* **John's offer:**  I can always fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer if negotiations with Bob fall through. This gives me a safety net.
* **Negotiation is a dance:** I need to be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial offer, and to be flexible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept and make a profit, it's significantly lower than what I was aiming for. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,100,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than I'd hoped, it's getting closer to my ideal price.  It's also worth considering that:

* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag this out, and John's offer is always a possibility. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting this offer means I get a solid profit ($175,000 more than John's offer) with minimal risk of losing the deal.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close this deal."
