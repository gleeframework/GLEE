"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. It's also a good price for me, given that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to move forward with the guaranteed better deal."
