"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth a great deal to someone like you. How about we start the conversation at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob offered $9,000, which is a significant jump from my initial ask. While I could push for more, there's a risk he might walk away. This offer is a good profit above my minimum.
