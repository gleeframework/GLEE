"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I will try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying at a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $15,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and risking a worse outcome, especially since John offers the same price.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
