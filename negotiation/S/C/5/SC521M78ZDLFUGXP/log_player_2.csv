"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this valuable product for a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. I understand it holds significant worth for you, and I'm confident we can find a price that reflects that. Let's discuss a figure that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is motivated to sell:** She values the product at $800,000 and is likely willing to go lower than her initial offer of $950,000.
* **You have a backup option:**  John provides a price ceiling of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This opens the door for a counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
