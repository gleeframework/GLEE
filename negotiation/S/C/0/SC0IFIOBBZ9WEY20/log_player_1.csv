Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your position, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider something closer to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Can you consider that?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,250. How about we try $9,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently offering prices well below my minimum and showing a pattern of only moving halfway towards my counteroffers.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation risk."
