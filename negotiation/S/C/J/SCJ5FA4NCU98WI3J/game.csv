"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9500? This would ensure you still make a profit while allowing me to acquire the product within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget with each offer. While $10500 is closer, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. How about $9800? This would give you a good return while allowing me to secure the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this price.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really serious about this, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I think we can both walk away happy.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, but $10000 is still too high for me. I'm very close to my budget and I'm confident we can find a compromise.  How about $9900?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a very decent profit.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to push for a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm starting to think it's time to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10250, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",10250.0,Alice,9,
