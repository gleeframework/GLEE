"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, but I have 10 rounds to try.  It's better to explore the possibility of getting a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and also leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is only $1,000 more than my initial counteroffer. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's within my budget and saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might get me a better deal, but there's always the risk of Alice walking away or not meeting my price, and I'm confident with this offer."
