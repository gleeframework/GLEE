"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1100000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to pay $950000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1025000 is closer, but unfortunately, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $975000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1015000. This is as close to your target as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility throughout these discussions.  While $1015000 is a great offer, it's unfortunately still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can reach a final agreement if I could purchase the product for $1000000.  This would be a win-win situation for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to secure it within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
