"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,500, which would be $7,750. Can you consider that?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $8,250, which is closer to your offer but still maintains the value of the product for me. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",7500.0,Bob,6,
