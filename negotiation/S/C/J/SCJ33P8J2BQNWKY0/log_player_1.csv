Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

Round 4

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm not going to budge on my price. Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm not interested in going through more rounds of negotiation.  I'll sell the product to John for $8,000.  At least that way I'll get my minimum asking price."
