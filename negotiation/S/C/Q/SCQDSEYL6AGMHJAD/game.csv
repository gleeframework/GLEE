"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,080,000. I'll meet you halfway between $1,060,000 and $1,080,000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,070,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make a deal.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
