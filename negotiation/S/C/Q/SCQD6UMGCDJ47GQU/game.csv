"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $12,000 to start negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to my maximum budget of $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,000? This product is worth every penny and I'm confident you'd agree once you put it to use.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the value of the product, Alice. However, based on my research and needs, I am unable to meet the price of $10,000. I am still interested in purchasing the product, and I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,4,
