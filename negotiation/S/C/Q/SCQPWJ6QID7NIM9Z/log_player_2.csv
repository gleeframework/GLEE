# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its worth to you.  While I'm confident in selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000, I'm open to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested.
