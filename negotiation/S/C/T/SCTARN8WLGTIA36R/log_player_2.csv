"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1100000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it's still a strong profit for me. Let me know what you think.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so she is likely to be motivated to sell. I'm not willing to pay $1,100,000, which is more than I'm willing to spend. I'll look for a better deal.
