Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,400,000 before I consider other offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to make even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $100,000 discount from its actual value to him, while you gain an extra $400,000 from your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""other offers,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
