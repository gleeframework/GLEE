"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my minimum price and still leaves you with a good profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1250000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
