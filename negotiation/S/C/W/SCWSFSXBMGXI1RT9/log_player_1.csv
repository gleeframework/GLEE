"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping I can get closer to my target price of $115. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $107.50 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have several rounds left, so I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109. This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 109}
