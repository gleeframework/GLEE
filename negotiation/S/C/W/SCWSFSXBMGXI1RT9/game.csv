"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109. This would be a good deal for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
