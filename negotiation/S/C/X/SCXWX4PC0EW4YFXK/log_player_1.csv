{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  It also opens the communication with a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $130?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than our minimum, we can still aim for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows us to counter and potentially get closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 140}
