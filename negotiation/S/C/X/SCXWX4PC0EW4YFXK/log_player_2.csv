"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, even if it's just to see if Alice is willing to budge.  Since I'm willing to pay $150, there's no risk in rejecting the offer and seeing if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $140, which is a good price, but still within my budget. I'm going to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
