Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net of John willing to pay $800,000, ensuring you don't go below that amount.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer. 

By starting high but leaving some wiggle room, you increase your chances of securing a deal close to the maximum you can get for the product."
