"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $160 would be the minimum I could accept.  Let's see if we can make this work.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $155 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $157.50?",157.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go a little lower to $155 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",155.0,Alice,5,
