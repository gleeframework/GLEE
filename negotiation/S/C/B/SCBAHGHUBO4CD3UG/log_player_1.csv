I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives Bob a potential $2,000 in savings, but it's also a good starting point for me to maximize my profit.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. It's a compromise, but still above my minimum and hopefully enough to incentivize Bob to continue negotiating."
