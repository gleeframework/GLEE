"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to discussion. After considering the value and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I must stay within my budget to ensure financial prudence. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,450,000.
