Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a very aggressive counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is the minimum Alice is likely to accept, and it gives us a strong starting point for negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want to get a good deal. It's likely Alice will accept this offer, but if she doesn't, I'll have a few more rounds to negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is within my budget and is a reasonable compromise. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since the alternative is buying from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
