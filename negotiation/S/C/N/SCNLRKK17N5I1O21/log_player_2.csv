{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's always beneficial to try and get a lower price, especially since you have 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  I'm aiming for a price that's still within my budget, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my initial counteroffer, but I believe there's still room for improvement. I want to continue exploring the possibility of a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. This is a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  I believe this is a fair price that both parties can agree to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,250 is getting closer to my preferred price point.  While I'd still like to get a lower price, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether. It's also a much better price than what John is offering.  I think it's a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it."
