"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $800,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I've already met you halfway, and I believe this price is still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
