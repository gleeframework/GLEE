"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I think you'll love this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's important to negotiate and try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $8,000 is still quite low considering the product's value to me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think you'll find it's a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to push for a price closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm eager to make this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. It's a bit higher than your limit, but it's still a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $8,000.  You should continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to your limit.  There are still rounds available to negotiate, so it's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $10,000, and I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, Bob. I think you're getting a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000. Let's try $10,500. It's a small increase, but it's worth it to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is tempting, it's still slightly above your maximum budget of $8,000. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for your desired price of $8,000. You've already made significant progress in negotiations, and you're guaranteed to get a good deal by buying from John."
