Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, but it's also significantly lower than the product's minimum value to me.  This allows room for negotiation if Bob is interested but also gives me a good starting point. 

I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value for the product. If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below the product's minimum value to me. While selling to John at $1,000,000 would be a safe option, I believe there is still potential to get a higher price from Bob. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. It's still significantly above John's offer, but it shows a willingness to negotiate. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than John's, it is still far from the product's minimum value to me. I am willing to continue negotiations and make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to  $1,150,000. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and Bob's previous counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price point.  I am willing to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
