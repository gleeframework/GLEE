You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $12,000.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice."
