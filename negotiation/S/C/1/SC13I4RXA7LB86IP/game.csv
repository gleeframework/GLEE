"Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $18,000.  This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
