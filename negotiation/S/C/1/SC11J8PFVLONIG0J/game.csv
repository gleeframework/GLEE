"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $17,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $16,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  That way we both get a good deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
