"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $12500? This would allow us to reach a compromise that suits both our needs.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still a bit away from meeting your target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $14000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I see that you're trying to accommodate my budget, but unfortunately, I can't agree to the price of $14000. I'm still aiming for something closer to $12500. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
