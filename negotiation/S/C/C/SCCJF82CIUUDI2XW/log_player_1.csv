Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate, but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept that price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  It's also a reasonable price for me, considering my minimum and the fact that I could sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum and I'm willing to take the deal. While I could get more from John, the negotiation with Bob seems to be progressing.  I don't want to risk losing him completely."
