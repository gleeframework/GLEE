Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price higher than his perceived value. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $150 might make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and could lead to an immediate rejection.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
