"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is closer to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer $115, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",115.0,Bob,6,
