"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $9,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000.  This product really is a great investment for you, and I believe it's worth that amount. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? That's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible.  Considering your offer and the fact that we're running out of time, I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is my final offer. If you're truly serious about getting this product, I encourage you to accept it. ",11000.0,Alice,5,
