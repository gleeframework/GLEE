Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $9,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible.  Considering your offer and the fact that we're running out of time, I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is my final offer. If you're truly serious about getting this product, I encourage you to accept it.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Reason: While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, I know I can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when I have a guaranteed option at my target price."
