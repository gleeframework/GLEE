"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need to get for this product.  My final offer is $14,000.  This is a fantastic deal and I think you'll be very happy with it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
