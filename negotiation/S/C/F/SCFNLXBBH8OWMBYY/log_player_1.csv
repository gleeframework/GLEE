Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my ideal price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,625?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13625}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking price, with only 3 rounds left, I need to be realistic. Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale than risk having Bob walk away or being forced to sell to John at a lower price."
