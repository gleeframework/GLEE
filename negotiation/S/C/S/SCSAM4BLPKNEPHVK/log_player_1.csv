"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and optimistic, emphasizing the value of the product. This helps to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I can hopefully secure a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer, but I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a compromise that's more favorable to me. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum but still lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open, knowing that he's a guaranteed buyer at a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $150? That's a fair price that accounts for the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and the price John is willing to pay.
* **Message:** I'm staying firm but polite, highlighting the fairness of my offer and acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. I'm also making a clear statement about my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that's closer to my minimum and acknowledging Bob's perspective, I'm hoping to reach a compromise that benefits both of us.  If Bob still rejects, I'll have to weigh the risks of further negotiation against the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $130. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, as I'm still willing to negotiate further. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I'm hoping that with continued negotiation, we can arrive at a mutually acceptable price. However, I'm still aware of the option to sell to John and will keep that in mind throughout the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $140? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both some room to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $140, which is closer to Bob's offer of $130 but still above my minimum of $150. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing fairness and compromise, acknowledging Bob's position while still asserting my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can be reasonably happy with.  By making a small concession, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer. However, I'm also keeping my options open, aware that I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $135. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the product's value.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I believe I can get closer to my target price with one more round of negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to bridge the small gap between our desired prices. I'm hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round. However, I'm also aware of the option to sell to John and will keep that in mind if our negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $135 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $145, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, and it's a price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $145, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price of $150. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing compromise and finality, letting Bob know that this is my best offer. I'm also framing it as a win-win situation for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. I'm hoping that the slight concession and the emphasis on compromise will persuade him to accept. However, I'm also prepared to sell to John for $150 if this offer is rejected.  I'm confident that this strategy will allow me to get the best possible price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I would like to counter with a price of $140. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $140 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I've already reached my final offer and am not willing to go any lower. I've exhausted my negotiation options, and selling to John for $150 guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirements.

**Strategy:**

This decision is a strategic move to secure a guaranteed profit. While I've made multiple attempts to negotiate with Bob, I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Selling to John allows me to maximize my profits and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
