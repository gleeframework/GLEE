"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities, I'm starting the bidding at $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique qualities"" and ""potential"" to justify the high starting price. 
* **Alternative:**  I'm keeping the John offer ($1,500,000) in mind as a fallback option if negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a very competitive price considering the unique benefits this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession of $200,000 to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and to encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still holding relatively firm above my minimum price ($1,500,000). 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Observation:** I'm watching Bob's counteroffers closely. If he doesn't show significant movement towards my range in the next round or two, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm offering $1,300,000.  Let's keep working towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob increased his offer by $200,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Still Below Minimum:** However, $1,300,000 remains below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Continued Negotiation:** I'll continue the negotiation process, but I'll make it clear that my price flexibility is becoming limited."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. However, I do need to be realistic about the product's value.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to take it seriously.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,450,000, which is just above my absolute minimum.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need for a decision soon, implying that the alternative (selling to John) is still a possibility. 
* **Calculated Risk:** This is a calculated risk. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to hold firm at the risk of losing the deal, or concede further and accept a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm offering $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more, the difference is now relatively small.
* **Time Investment:**  We've already spent six rounds negotiating, and continuing might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now saves time and ensures a sale.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might walk away if I push further, leaving me to start over with John. Accepting the current offer guarantees a good profit."
