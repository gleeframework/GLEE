"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities, I'm starting the bidding at $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's a good starting point to negotiate, but it's not a deal Bob would accept.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a very competitive price considering the unique benefits this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his desired range.  He can still buy from John for $1,000,000, so there's no immediate need to accept."

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm offering $1,300,000.  Let's keep working towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
