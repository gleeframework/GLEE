"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $650,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $750,000 is the lowest I can go.  This still represents a great value for you.  What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $750,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
