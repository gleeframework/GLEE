"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair starting point, considering its worth to both of us. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,000,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for a product that we both know is worth a lot.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  However,  $1,125,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's make a deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 to close this deal today.  It's a strong offer, and I think it's beneficial for both of us to avoid further negotiation.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
