# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $875,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $875,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
