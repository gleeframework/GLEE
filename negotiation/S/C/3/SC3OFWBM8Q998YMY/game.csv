"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to purchase it for a price closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider something in that range?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $850,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $875,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
