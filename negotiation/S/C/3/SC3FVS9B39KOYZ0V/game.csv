"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $750,000. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be mindful of my minimum value. Let's try $725,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'd be willing to meet you at $712,500. That's right in the middle of our last two offers and feels like a fair compromise.",712500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to my minimum value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be careful. Let's try $715,000. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",715000.0,Alice,7,
