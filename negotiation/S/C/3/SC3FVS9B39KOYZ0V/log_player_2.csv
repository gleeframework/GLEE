Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to my minimum value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be careful. Let's try $715,000. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is clearly signaling she's nearing her bottom line.  While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and there's a risk Alice will walk away.  $715,000 is a reasonable price compared to our $800,000 alternative with John."
