Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than your guaranteed sale price ($15,000) allows room for negotiation while aiming for the highest possible profit. 
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Offering Bob a ""first look"" creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially making him more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's no risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John."
