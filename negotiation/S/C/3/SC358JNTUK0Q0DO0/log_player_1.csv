Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **Higher than my minimum:**  $95 is above my minimum of $80, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Not too high:**  It's also significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $100, leaving room for negotiation if he rejects. 
* **Friendly tone:**  The message establishes a friendly tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Test the waters:**  By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how determined Bob is to buy the product. 
* **Potentially get a better price:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to increase his offer slightly in the next round. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not immediately accepting, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Next Move:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his current offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's really the lowest I can go. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to stick to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $87 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  $87 is only $7 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, and I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely.
* **John's offer:**  While John offers $80, I'm not guaranteed that he'll be a reliable buyer. Bob seems more serious and likely to close the deal.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $87 is a good compromise, allowing me to make a decent profit while securing a sale with a seemingly reliable buyer."
