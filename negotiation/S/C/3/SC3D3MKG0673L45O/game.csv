"Bob,  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is worth a lot to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This allows for a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
