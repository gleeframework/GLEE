Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price from John increases the chances Bob will find it a good deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially allowing me to still get a better price than $150.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:**  If I start too high (close to $150), Bob might think I'm desperate and lowball me. A slightly lower starting point seems more reasonable."
