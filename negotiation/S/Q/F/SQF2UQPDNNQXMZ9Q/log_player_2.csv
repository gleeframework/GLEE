# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the minimum she's willing to sell for, which means there's room for negotiation.  It's also below my maximum budget, so I should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. My counteroffer is $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but $1,300,000 is still above my preferred range. There's still potential for negotiation, and I'm not desperate enough to accept her offer yet. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,225,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer while still meeting my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate.  The value I'm willing to pay for the product is below that, and I'm not desperate enough to accept her offer yet.  I'm not willing to buy from John at this time, as Alice is still closer to my desired price."

Round 6
