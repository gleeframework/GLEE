Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $150 asking price represents a significant 50% markup, which is a common starting point in negotiations.
* **First Refusal Tactic:** By emphasizing that Bob has the first opportunity, you create a subtle sense of scarcity and potential loss if he declines. 

This approach allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your guaranteed profit."
