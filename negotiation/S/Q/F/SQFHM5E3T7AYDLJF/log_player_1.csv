Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can use that as a baseline and aim higher with Bob. Offering the product at $15,000 allows for negotiation.  

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $15,000 offer, and I make a $5,000 profit.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, I sell to John at $10,000, meeting my minimum price.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still ensuring I don't lose out on the sale."
