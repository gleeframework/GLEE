"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. How about $900,000? That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make it work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
