"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that I value at no less than $8,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step towards Bob's goal of saving money. It's a reasonable compromise, offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum value but below Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for further negotiation while showing Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering Bob's maximum budget is $10,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is better than buying from John while still leaving a little room for profit if Bob later resells the product.  There's no need to risk further negotiation, as it's unlikely Alice will go lower and Bob might risk losing the deal altogether."
