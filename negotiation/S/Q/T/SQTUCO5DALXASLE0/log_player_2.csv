"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose we start the negotiation at $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $14,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point for the counteroffers that will likely follow."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we set the price at $13000. This still reflects the value of the product while accommodating your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still feeling a bit high at $13,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get the best price. By splitting the difference, it signals a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a lower price point."
