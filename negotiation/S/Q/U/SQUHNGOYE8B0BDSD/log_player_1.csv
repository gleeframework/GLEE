{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $120. It's a steal for the value you'll get! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100) and leaving some room for negotiation. It's important to be confident and communicate the value of the product while also leaving some space for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum value of $100 and is not a reasonable starting point for negotiation. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $90, which still reflects the value of this amazing product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $90, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and leaving room for further negotiation, hoping to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about $75? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100. I will reject his offer and try to reach a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to get at least $85 to make this worthwhile. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe $85 is a fair price that reflects its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering $85, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. I'm reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing that $85 is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value and accept this offer."
