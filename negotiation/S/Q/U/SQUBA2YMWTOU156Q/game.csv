"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,250,000 is way above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the value this product offers.  While $1,200,000 is a significant jump, I'm targeting a price closer to $2,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a deal, but I can't go over $1,400,000.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the value you'll gain from it.  What do you say, shall we make a deal?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,700,000 is still a little outside my range.  I'm ready to finalize this deal, but I need to stay under $1,500,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
