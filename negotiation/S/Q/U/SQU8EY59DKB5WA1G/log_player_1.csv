Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $120 is more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $120 is less than what Bob values the product at ($150). 
* **It allows for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for both you and Bob to potentially negotiate a price that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is a good deal for you. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's a significant step closer to your desired price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and you'll be left with the $80 offer from John."
