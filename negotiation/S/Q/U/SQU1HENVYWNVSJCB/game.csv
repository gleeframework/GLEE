,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000 to acknowledge your willingness to compromise. Let's meet in the middle for a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $625000. Can we discuss further?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $625000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $850000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
