{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product, valued at $1,000,000 to me.  I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you.  I'm starting the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's lower than my minimum threshold.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I still need to ensure the product's value is adequately reflected.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,050,000.  This allows for some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum threshold.  It's also a good outcome for both of us, and it saves time and effort in further negotiations."
