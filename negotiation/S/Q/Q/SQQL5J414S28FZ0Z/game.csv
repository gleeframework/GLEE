"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I still need to ensure the product's value is adequately reflected.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,050,000.  This allows for some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
