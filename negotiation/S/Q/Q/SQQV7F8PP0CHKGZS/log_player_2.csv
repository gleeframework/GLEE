"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I know you're interested in. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's more than Alice values the product for, accepting Alice's offer of $14,000 is the best choice for Bob.  Here's why:

* **Saves Money:** Buying from Alice at $14,000 is cheaper than John's $15,000 price.
* **Within Budget:** The price is still under Bob's $15,000 limit."
