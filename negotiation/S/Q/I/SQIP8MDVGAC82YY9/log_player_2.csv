"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable product for a one-time price of $950,000. This is a rare chance to acquire a high-end item that I'm confident you'll find highly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum valuation of $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John for $1,000,000, which is your upper limit."
