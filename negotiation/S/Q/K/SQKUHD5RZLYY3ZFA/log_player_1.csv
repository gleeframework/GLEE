"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $10,500 is the best deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $9,500 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, so I'll keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stubborn and seems unwilling to move much further.  It's getting late in the negotiation and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's not the most I could possibly get, but it's a good price and it's time to move on."
