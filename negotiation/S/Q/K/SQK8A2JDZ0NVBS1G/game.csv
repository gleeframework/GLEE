"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  If that works for you, let's seal the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell it to you for $92.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",92.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. ",85.0,Bob,6,
