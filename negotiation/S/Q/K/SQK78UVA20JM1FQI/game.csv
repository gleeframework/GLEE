"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my initial assessment.  To kick off the negotiations, I propose a starting price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000 and go from there?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $1,225,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. Would you be open to $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,180,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $1,180,000 is getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,165,000? I think that's fair for both of us.",1165000.0,Bob,6,
