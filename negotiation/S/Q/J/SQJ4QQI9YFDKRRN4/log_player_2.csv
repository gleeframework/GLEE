"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, and $105 is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer. This price is still above Alice's minimum of $100, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $115. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also showing a clear desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is only $5 more than Bob's counteroffer. This price is within Bob's acceptable range of $120, and it's better than buying from John for $120.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small price decrease, and Bob risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John."
