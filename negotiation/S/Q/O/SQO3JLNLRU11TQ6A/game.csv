"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. How about $9,500? That's a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
