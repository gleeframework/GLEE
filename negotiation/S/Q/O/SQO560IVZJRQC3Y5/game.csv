"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the potential value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value it brings to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not there.  I can offer you $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. Let's aim for a final agreement this round.",11000.0,Bob,4,
