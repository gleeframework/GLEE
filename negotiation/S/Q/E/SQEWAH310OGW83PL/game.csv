"Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you. However, we're not willing to go as low as $750,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but we're not quite there yet. We're willing to make one more concession. We'll offer the product for $815,000. This is as low as we're willing to go, and we believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",815000.0,Alice,5,
