Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,500,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?
