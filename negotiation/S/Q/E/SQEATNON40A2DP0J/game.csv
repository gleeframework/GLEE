"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,800,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  $1,000,000 undervalues it significantly.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,500,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? ",1250000.0,Bob,4,
