"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a very high price. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $12000. This is a good compromise between your budget and my asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than $20,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can likely still negotiate a better price. Bob should aim for a price closer to his ideal $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high.  I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget.  He can likely negotiate further. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to go lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has reached her limit.  The price is still above Bob's budget, and he only has one round left.  It's better to buy from John and save $2,000 than risk losing the product completely."
