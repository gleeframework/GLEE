"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and potential.  To make this a win-win, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I think that's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit above what I can comfortably offer.  How about $9,800?  It's a fair compromise closer to our respective positions.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,800 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work. Would you consider $9,950? It's my final offer.",9950.0,Alice,5,
