"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Even if Alice rejects the counteroffer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  While buying from John is an option, it's always better to try and negotiate a lower price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for Bob. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate.  By offering a price closer to Alice's desired value, Bob increases the likelihood of Alice accepting the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than $1,200,000 from John, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. He still has room to lower the price further, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step up from Bob's previous offer, showing that he's willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his desired value. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward, increasing the chances of a successful deal without risking going too low and jeopardizing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is the best deal Bob has gotten so far. While he could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price. Also, there's a risk that Alice might get frustrated and walk away from the deal completely.  Buying from John would be more expensive, making accepting Alice's offer the best choice in this situation."
