"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $11,250. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
