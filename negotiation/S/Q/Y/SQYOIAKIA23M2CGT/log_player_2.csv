Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $11,250. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very attached to that $11,000 mark.  It's unlikely further haggling will get the price down much more. Accepting at $11,250 secures a good discount."
