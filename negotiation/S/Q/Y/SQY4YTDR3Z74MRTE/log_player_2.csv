(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price range.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with $1,080,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is closer to your desired price range, but it's still a bit high. You can continue to negotiate for a better price, considering you have more rounds to work with.  There's room to get closer to your target without rushing into a deal that isn't quite ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,080,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,065,000?  This would allow both of us to be satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1065000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,065,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with $1,090,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is close to your target, you still have more room to negotiate.  She's stated this is her final offer, but with several rounds left, she might be willing to budge a bit more if you reject.  It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price range before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get your target price, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,095,000. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with $1,085,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** You're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a good chance Alice won't budge further.
* **Close to Target:**  $1,085,000 is closer to your target price of $1,000,000 than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Potential Compromise:** Even though it's not your ideal price, this offer represents a potential compromise and a chance to secure the product.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy considering the remaining rounds and the alternative option of buying from John."
