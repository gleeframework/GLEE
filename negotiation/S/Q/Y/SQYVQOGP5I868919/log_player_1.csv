Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you could start higher, aiming for a price close to his maximum valuation ($120) might scare him off. $100 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a good profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $80. This knowledge empowers you to aim higher with Bob."
