"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's a great deal for both of us. It's something you've expressed strong interest in, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to negotiate, but my absolute minimum is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so it's likely that she's motivated to sell. I'd like to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject her offer and consider buying from John for $15,000, which is still within my budget of $15,000.
