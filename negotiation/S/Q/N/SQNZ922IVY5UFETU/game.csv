"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $85 right now. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to complete this transaction.  ",90.0,Bob,4,
