"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $120 is too high. You're better off buying from John for $80 and staying within your budget."
