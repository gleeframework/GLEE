"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $11,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counter-offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  While John's offer is a good alternative, there's still a chance Bob could get a lower price from Alice."
