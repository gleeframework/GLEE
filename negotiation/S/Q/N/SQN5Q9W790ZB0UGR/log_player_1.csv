""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My asking price is $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn an even higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's:
    *  Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us room for negotiation if needed.
    *  Below John's guaranteed purchase price, ensuring we're still making a substantial profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
