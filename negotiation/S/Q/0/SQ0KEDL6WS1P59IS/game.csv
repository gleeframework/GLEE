"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm afraid $1200000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
