Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than Bob's maximum allows for some back-and-forth if he tries to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value and Exclusivity:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob and framing it as an exclusive opportunity adds pressure for him to accept.
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
