Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see significant value in.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation without losing him to a rejected offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still staying well above our minimum price.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message aims to project confidence in the product's value while avoiding an overly aggressive opening that might alienate Bob.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while keeping Bob engaged in the deal."
