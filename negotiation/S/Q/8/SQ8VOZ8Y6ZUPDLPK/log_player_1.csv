Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a quicker sale.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so the offer needs to be enticing while still significantly above his valuation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high offer and a realistic chance of Bob accepting. There's always the risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential for a higher profit than John's guaranteed price makes this a calculated risk."
