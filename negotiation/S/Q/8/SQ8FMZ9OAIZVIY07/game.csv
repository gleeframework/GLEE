"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great value for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  $11,000 is the lowest I can go right now. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach my minimum target. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $10,750.  This would be a fair deal for both parties, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $10,750 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875.  This would be a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. What do you say?",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $10,875 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here.  Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Bob,6,
