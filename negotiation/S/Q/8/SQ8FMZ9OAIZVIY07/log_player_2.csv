"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great value for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,500 is still above your target of saving money.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  You can potentially get a better price by negotiating.
