"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great value for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  $11,000 is the lowest I can go right now. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach my minimum target. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $10,750.  This would be a fair deal for both parties, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal target. I'm confident I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $10,750 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875.  This would be a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $10,875 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and is significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and it would be risky to keep negotiating with only 4 rounds left."
