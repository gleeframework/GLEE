"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $140? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $135? It's a small step, but it gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at this price.",135.0,Alice,5,
