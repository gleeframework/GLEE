"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  Considering the value this product holds for me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, given my needs and the value you've placed on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still significantly more than I can afford.  Given my limited budget, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential we've both discussed. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
