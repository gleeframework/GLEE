"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal. If he rejects this offer, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to be mindful of the limited rounds, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable value. While I could risk losing Bob, I'm hoping he'll see the value of the product and be willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than before, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer again and try to push for a price closer to what I'm looking for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to drop my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive. I'll make another counteroffer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000.  This is a slight increase from my previous offer and hopefully a good middle ground. Time is running out, and this may be my last chance to get a decent price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive and try to push for a higher price. I'm going to make another counteroffer and hope to secure a deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,125,000.  It's a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my initial asking price.  This is my last chance to close a deal with Bob before I have to settle for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, but with only one round left, I'm going to take the sure thing.  I've already rejected a few offers that were higher than what John is offering, so it's likely that Bob isn't going to budge much further.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,200,000."
