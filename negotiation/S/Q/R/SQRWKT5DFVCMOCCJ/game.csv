"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $105. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $92.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
