Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make at least $120, which is your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's a strong starting point:** You're not giving away too much value initially, which encourages Bob to negotiate rather than simply accepting the first offer. 

This approach allows for a potential back-and-forth negotiation with Bob, giving you the opportunity to potentially get closer to his value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to take the offer and avoid further negotiation, it's better to hold firm. 

By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price point and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price that ensures I can cover my costs, and I'm confident you'll get great value out of this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 

This counteroffer balances a few key points:

* **Above your minimum:**  You're still making more than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Closer to Bob's offer:** By lowering your price from $140 to $125, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourage Bob to meet you halfway.
* **Reasonable expectation:**  You're giving Bob a fair chance to purchase the product at a price that's still good for you. 

By making a counteroffer, you're keeping the negotiation going and potentially getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
