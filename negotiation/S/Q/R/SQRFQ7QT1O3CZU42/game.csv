"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $100, so I'm offering it to you for $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
