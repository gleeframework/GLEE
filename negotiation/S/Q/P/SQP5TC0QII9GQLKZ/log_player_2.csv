"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer represents a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, but still offers a profit for Alice above her own valuation. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and if Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob wants to pay, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to his target. While it's a risk, staying in the negotiation could lead to a better outcome than settling for $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise. This offer is still significantly below Alice's initial price, but it also represents a decent profit for Alice above her valuation.  It's a moderate approach to try and reach a compromise before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation. It's still more than Bob wants to pay, and rejecting the offer gives him another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is building, but it's worth trying to squeeze out more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, but still within Bob's desired price range. With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to start closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds remaining, the negotiation is reaching a stalemate.  Alice is unwilling to budge below $930,000, which is still above Bob's desired price range. While Bob could continue to counteroffer, the risk of failing to reach a deal and having to buy from John for a significantly higher price is too great.  It's better to cut his losses and buy from John, ensuring he gets the product while still staying within his budget."
