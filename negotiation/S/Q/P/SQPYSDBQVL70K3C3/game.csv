"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $6,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $8,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,5,
