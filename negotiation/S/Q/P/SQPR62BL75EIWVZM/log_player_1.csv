"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within the realm of possibility for Bob, considering he values the product at $100. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the message in a positive way to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $175, I leave room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $150 for it, which is closer to its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob is offering my minimum price of $150. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  Since Bob is already offering my minimum, there's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could take up time and I may not get a better offer."
