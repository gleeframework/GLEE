"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10950? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a good compromise.",10950.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10950. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11200. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit.",11200.0,Alice,5,
