"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly profitable for your company.  While I can certainly sell it to someone else for $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer you a lower price due to our existing relationship.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the market value, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, saving him $200,000."
