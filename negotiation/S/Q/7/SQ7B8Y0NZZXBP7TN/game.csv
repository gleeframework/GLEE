"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $600,000? I feel that's a fair price that acknowledges the value while working for me.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $650,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $625,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $675,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.
