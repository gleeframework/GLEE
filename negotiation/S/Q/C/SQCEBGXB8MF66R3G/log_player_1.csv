Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches John's standing offer. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher.  Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation rounds."
