"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1350000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
