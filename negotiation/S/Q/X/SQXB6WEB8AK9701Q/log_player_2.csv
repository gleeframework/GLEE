"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking $1200000.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
