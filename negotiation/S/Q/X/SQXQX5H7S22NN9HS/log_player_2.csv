Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about $12,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? It's a good compromise, and still a great value for you.  Let me know what you think.
