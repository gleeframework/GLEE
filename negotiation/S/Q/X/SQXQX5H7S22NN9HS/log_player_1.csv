Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about $12,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and I can get $10,000 from John. Therefore, I want to see if I can get closer to Bob's valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? It's a good compromise, and still a great value for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500.  Let's split the difference - how about $13,000? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer for $13,000.  While it's not as high as I'd initially hoped, it's still a good deal for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer of $10,000.  There's a good chance Bob might not budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the sale."
