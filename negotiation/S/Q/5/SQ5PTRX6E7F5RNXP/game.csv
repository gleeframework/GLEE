"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $105?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $105 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $97.50 is still below what I can accept. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $101.25. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",101.25,Alice,5,
