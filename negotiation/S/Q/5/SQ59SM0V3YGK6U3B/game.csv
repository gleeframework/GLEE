"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,700.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8700.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close, but I still think $8,700 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,600? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8600.0,Alice,5,
