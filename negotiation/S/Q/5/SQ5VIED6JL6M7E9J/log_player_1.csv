Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you and I'm pleased to offer it to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John acts as a price floor, guaranteeing Alice $1,500,000.  Therefore, Alice's goal is to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,450,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's highly motivated, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price."
