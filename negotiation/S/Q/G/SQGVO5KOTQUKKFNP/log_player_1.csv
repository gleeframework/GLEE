I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly more than what I'd get from John, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a compromise,  closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above what I'd get from John. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
