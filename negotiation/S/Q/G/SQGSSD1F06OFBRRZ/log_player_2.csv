"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I still get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
