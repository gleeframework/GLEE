Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to $1,050,000, which is the same as her previous offer.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $1,000,000, there's a good chance she won't go lower.  This is a good deal for me as it's significantly lower than John's price.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
