Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation."
