It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Rejecting Alice's offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to get a reasonable price while also offering you a good deal.

Alice has come down to $1,025,000 which is only $25,000 more than what you are willing to pay from John. This is a good deal for both of you, and it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
