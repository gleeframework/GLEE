"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to get a reasonable price while also offering you a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
