"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $105 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $110, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $115. I'm willing to give you a small discount, though - I'll sell the product to you for $112.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",112.5,Alice,5,
