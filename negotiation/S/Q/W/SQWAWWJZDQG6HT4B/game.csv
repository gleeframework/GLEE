"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think you'll really benefit from having this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and the fact that I could purchase it elsewhere for $8,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this negotiation.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
