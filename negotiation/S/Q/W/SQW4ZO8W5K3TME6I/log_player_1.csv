"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping it friendly and open-ended to encourage a response and begin the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum of $150, so it's not a viable option. 
* **Proceeding to the next round:** I want to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can secure a better price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle? I can do $120. This is a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $120 is a compromise that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraint while reiterating that this is a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try $110 as my counteroffer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm not desperate for a sale, and John is a guaranteed $150. 
* **Proceeding to the next round:**  I'll continue negotiating with Bob. There's still room for a compromise that could benefit both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $115 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $115 is a slight concession from my previous offer, but it still leaves me with a comfortable profit margin.
* **Message:**  I'm conveying a sense of finality while remaining polite and appealing to Bob's sense of fairness. I'm confident that $115 is a good deal for him, considering the product's value to him is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Let's try $110 again as my counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a stalemate. Bob seems unwilling to budge from his $110 offer, while I'm determined to get at least $115.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $150. It's a safer option than risking a further decrease in price with Bob and potentially ending up with less than what John is offering."
