"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  This price still offers you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,500, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit further apart. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still thinking $8,750 is a fair price for me. Can you consider that?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about we settle on $9,250? This would give us both a good deal and close this negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to lose patience. I've been willing to negotiate and meet you halfway, but $9,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'll give you one last chance: $8,000 or I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's ultimatum has made me realize that I'm unlikely to get a higher price from him. I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely, so I'll accept John's offer of $8,000.  It's my minimum, and I don't want to keep negotiating with Bob if he's not going to budge."
