"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? This would still leave you with a nice profit margin and allows me to make a reasonable profit as well.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $9,500 price point. Would you consider coming down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
