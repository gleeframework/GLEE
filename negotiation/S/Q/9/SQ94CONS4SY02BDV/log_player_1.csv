"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant amount higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully ensures Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer.  It also shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm confident that I can get at least $9,500 from Bob, and I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still pushes for a price closer to my desired outcome."
