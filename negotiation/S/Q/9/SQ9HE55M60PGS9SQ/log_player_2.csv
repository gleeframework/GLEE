Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my assessment, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, while still allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1050000 is simply not a price I can accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This price reflects the unique value of this product to you, and I believe it allows for a fair and profitable deal for both of us. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still above my budget.

Let's find a middle ground and seal this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
