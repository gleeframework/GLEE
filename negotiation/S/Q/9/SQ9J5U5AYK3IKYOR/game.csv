"I understand you're looking to bring the price down, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $1,025,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I've already had a better offer from John for $1,000,000, and I'm inclined to take it. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer to you, but I need to be honest with you, it's going to be a tough pill to swallow. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
