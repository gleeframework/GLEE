"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, there's a chance I can get a better deal by negotiating.  I'll start by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  Would you be willing to consider $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a bit low for me. How about $135? I think that's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $150 to $135, which is within my budget. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer and I might end up paying the same $150 to John.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to accept."
