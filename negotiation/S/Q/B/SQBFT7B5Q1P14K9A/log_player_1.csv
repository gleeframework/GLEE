Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  Would you be willing to consider $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.
