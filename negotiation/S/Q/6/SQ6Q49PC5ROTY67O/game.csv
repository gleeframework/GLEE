"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, valued at no less than $1500000 to me. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  I'm starting with an offer of $2000000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not giving away the value of this product.  How about $1750000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us to make a mutually beneficial deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1600000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm still not quite there yet.  $1600000 is a good offer, but I need to be closer to $1700000 to make this worthwhile.  This product truly is exceptional, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let's compromise at $1650000.  What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1650000, which is $1625000. Can we agree on this price?",1625000.0,Bob,6,
