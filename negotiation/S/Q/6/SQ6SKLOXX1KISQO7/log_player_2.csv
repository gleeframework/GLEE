"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  Based on its potential, I'm asking for $950000.  I believe this price reflects its worth and provides you with a strong return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is too high, especially since he knows the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900000 for this product. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his target of $800,000.  While Alice has lowered her offer, $900,000 is still too high. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product.  This price is closer to what I believe is a fair value, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875000 is a step closer, I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $887500 for this product. It's a fair price considering its potential, and I believe it's an opportunity you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating and Alice has come down significantly.  $887,500 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal, but it's a good compromise.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and Alice rejecting further offers means Bob might end up paying more, or even be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer at this point secures a good deal and avoids potential losses."
