"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $875000 for the product.  This price is closer to what I believe is a fair value, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
