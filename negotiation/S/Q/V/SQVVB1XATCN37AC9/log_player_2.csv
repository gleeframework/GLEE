"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do business together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $2,000 less from Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a good deal for you. It's $1,500 less than buying from John and only $500 more than your initial counteroffer.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure a deal with Alice now."
