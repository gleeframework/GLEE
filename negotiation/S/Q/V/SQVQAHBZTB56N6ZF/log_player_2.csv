Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $12,000. My final offer is $16,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'm hoping we can close this deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still a bit high. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. There's a possibility that Alice might be willing to lower her price further, especially if she's truly interested in closing the deal today.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to buy from John at any time."

I believe this is a fair compromise, given our respective positions.  If you're serious about selling today, this is our best chance to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. It's also still within my budget and should provide Alice with a decent profit. By highlighting the ""final offer"" aspect, I'm putting pressure on Alice to close the deal today."
