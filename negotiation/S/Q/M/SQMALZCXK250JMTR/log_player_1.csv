Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. This is the maximum I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $15,000.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for your product. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum target of $15,000. I'll try to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is just not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider $10,000 for your product, as it's closer to the midpoint of our previous offers. This would allow us to reach an agreement while still respecting my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum target,  I've only got four rounds left and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure $15,000. 

I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John. It's a guaranteed profit and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob."
