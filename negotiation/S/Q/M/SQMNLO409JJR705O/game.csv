"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $135, which is a significant discount from the original price. I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $130, which is a bit closer to your target price. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $125. I think $130 is a fair compromise. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
