{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **My Minimum:** I need at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Offering it at $925,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal ($75,000) while netting me a significant profit above my minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring I don't lose the sale altogether."
