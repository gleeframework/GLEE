"Hi Alice,  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $12,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
