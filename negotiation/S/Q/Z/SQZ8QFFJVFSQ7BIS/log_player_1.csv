"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is slightly lower than my minimum value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This way I'm showing I'm open to a deal, but also leaving myself space to potentially increase the price if Bob counters with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $12,500. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I want to see if we can find a middle ground, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a price that is still above my minimum value but lower than my initial offer.  This shows flexibility and demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $13,000. Let's meet halfway and see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial desired price, it's only $2,000 below my minimum value and is closer to the middle ground we've been trying to reach.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for the same price doesn't seem worth it at this point."
