Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get as much as possible, and $140 is comfortably above your minimum of $120. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's a strong starting position:**  Offering $140 shows that you're serious about getting a good price.

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is above my minimum of $120, I'm not eager to settle for that price yet.  I still have room to negotiate, and Bob is clearly interested in the product.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm not giving up my target of a higher price just yet. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $135 is still above my minimum of $120, so I'm not losing money.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is truly committed to the product and willing to pay close to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $128 is very close to my minimum of $120.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would lead to a stalemate. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a profit that's close to my desired outcome.  It's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed $120 with John as an alternative."
