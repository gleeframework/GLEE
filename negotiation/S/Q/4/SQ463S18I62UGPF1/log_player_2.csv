"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,500 is too high.  Bob can likely get a better price. 
* **John's Price:**  While $12,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's good to have this as a backup option. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Bob should reject Alice's first offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice.
* **Counter Offer Logic:** A counteroffer of $10,500 represents a significant discount from Alice's offer of $11,500. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation.  It leaves room for Alice to counter, but also shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $11,000 is still too high for Bob. 
* **John's Price:**  While $12,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's still a better deal than Alice's current offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** It's still early in the negotiation. Bob should reject Alice's offer and continue to try to push for a lower price. There are 7 rounds remaining, and he might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Last Offer:** $11,000 is still too high.
* **Counteroffer Logic:** A counteroffer of $10,750 is a small increase from Bob's previous offer. It shows that he is willing to compromise but still wants to save money.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Bob is trying to find the middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's last offer. This could potentially encourage Alice to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $10,900 is only $900 above Bob's ideal price of $10,000. 
* **John's Price:** While $12,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, Alice's offer is significantly lower.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming riskier to continue negotiating.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves a significant amount of money compared to John. There is a chance that Alice will further reduce the price, but the risk of not getting a deal at all is too high at this point."
