"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. This price reflects its worth to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your budget concerns. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value it holds for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $15,500. This is a compromise that reflects the value I place on the product, and I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
