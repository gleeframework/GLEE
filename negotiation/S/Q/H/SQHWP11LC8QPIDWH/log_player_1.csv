{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic move:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** It's above his $800,000 threshold, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Lower than my minimum:** It's significantly lower than my $1,500,000 floor, giving me room to negotiate if necessary.

This approach allows for potential counteroffers while still keeping the deal above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I will not settle for a price that undervalues the product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you in the middle.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $975,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've negotiated with Bob for several rounds, and it seems we are at an impasse.  It's time to secure the guaranteed value from John."
