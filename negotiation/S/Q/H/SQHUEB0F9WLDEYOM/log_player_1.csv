"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I will counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,375,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,375,000. While it's still less than I initially hoped for, it's a fair price and a good compromise. It's also significantly higher than selling to John. It's important to prioritize getting the best possible price while also acknowledging the need to reach a mutually agreeable agreement."
