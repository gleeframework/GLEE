"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to lower the price further.  There's still room to get a better deal, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,375,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
