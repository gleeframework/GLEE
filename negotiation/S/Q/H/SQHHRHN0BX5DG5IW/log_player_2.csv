{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, which is also the price John is willing to sell for.  This is a strong opening counteroffer that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go higher.  If Alice rejects this offer, I can simply buy from John and avoid further negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I can get a better price.  John is offering the product at my desired price, so it's more efficient to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
