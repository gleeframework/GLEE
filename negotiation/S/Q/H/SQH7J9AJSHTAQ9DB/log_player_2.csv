"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $950,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe you'll find the product to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can save $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
