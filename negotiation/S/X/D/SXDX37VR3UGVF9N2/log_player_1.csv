Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other buyers and a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value of $1,000,000. There's a risk he might find the offer too high.
* **Alternative Offers:** Depending on Bob's response, we might need to adjust the price slightly. However, going below $1,200,000 is not advisable since we have John as a guaranteed buyer."
