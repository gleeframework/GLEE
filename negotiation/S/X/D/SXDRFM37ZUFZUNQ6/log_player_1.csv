Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and framing it as a good deal.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm not being aggressive, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage and a clear point at which I can walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below my initial offer of $10,000.
* **Leverage with John:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, so I have no reason to accept a lower offer from Bob. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I can counteroffer and potentially get a better price than Bob's initial offer, while still maintaining my leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to make this work. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while giving you a great product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's initial offer but still above his price and closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm reframing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" emphasizing the mutual benefit. 
* **Appeal to Logic:** I'm using logic to justify the price by mentioning a ""profit"" for me and a ""great product"" for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm still open to negotiation but holding firm on a price that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $9,000. I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for More Negotiation:** While I could try to counteroffer again, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and may be willing to go slightly higher.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000.  It's better to accept a good offer than risk losing out on the deal altogether."
