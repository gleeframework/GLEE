# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product for a competitive price. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You should try to negotiate with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This price takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to your budget, but you're still paying more than you'd like. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.** You can try to get the price down further.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1200000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  At $1,200,000, you're getting a good deal while staying within your $1,500,000 limit.
* **Further negotiation might be fruitless.** It's likely Alice won't budge much further, and you risk losing the deal.
* **Buying from John is a worse option.** You'd be paying $300,000 more.

This is a good compromise for both sides: you get the product at a fair price, and Alice makes a profit."
