"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this amazing item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Given the value of the product, I'd be willing to pay $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1020000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the item.",1020000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1020000 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still a bit away.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1035000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1035000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm proposing a price of $1030000 for the product. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach at this point.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
