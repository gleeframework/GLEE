"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer and I appreciate you working towards a fair deal.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about $13,500? ",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is right in the middle.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on $14,000, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can offer you $13,700 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other option. ",13700.0,Bob,8,
