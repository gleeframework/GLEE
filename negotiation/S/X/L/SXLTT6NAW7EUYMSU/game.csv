"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about we settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $725,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you consider $710,000?",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, though. How about we meet you at $718,000?",718000.0,Alice,5,
