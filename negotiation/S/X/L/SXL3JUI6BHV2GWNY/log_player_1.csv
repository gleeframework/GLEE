Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  The lowest price you'll accept is $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your reservation price and Bob's value. For a deal to happen, you need to offer a price below $1,200,000, but that would be selling at a loss.

**The Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at a price that meets your minimum, you have leverage. You can aim high with Bob, knowing you have a fallback option.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but ""Reasonable"" Price:** The price is below your guaranteed offer from John but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **Confidence and Exclusivity:** The message frames the offer as desirable and limited, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the initial price to create a sense of bargaining. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial,  you could mention your willingness to discuss the price further after presenting the initial offer.

**Remember:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer, don't be afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price that works for you."
