"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. ",85.0,Alice,3,
