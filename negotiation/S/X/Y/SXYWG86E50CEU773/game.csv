"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $90 and my original offer of $100. How about $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
