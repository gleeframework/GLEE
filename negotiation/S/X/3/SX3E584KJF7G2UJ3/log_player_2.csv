{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better. He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible and knows the product's value to him is $15,000. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He knows the product's worth to Alice is $10,000, so he's offering a price slightly above that. This initial counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in negotiating and willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, Bob needs to make a decision.  Alice's offer is only $100 higher than his last counteroffer, and it's getting very close to his desired price. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product for a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal or being forced to buy from John for a much higher price."
