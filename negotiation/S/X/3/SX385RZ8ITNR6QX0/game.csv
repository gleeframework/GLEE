,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly lower than its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?  That would be a fair compromise, I believe.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. I value your interest, but $7,000 is still below my bottom line.  My final offer is $8,500.  This is a significant discount, and I won't be able to go any lower.",8500.0,Alice,5,
