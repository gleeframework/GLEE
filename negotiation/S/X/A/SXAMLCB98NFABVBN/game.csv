"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic number. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, that price remains unrealistic for me.  I could consider $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. To be frank,  $850,000 is just too low for me to consider.  Let's find a solution – I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but we need to find a more reasonable middle ground.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering it's a significant step closer to your price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we do need to find a middle ground. I'm prepared to make a substantial move to get this deal done. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a big concession, and I need to see you move closer to that figure as well to make this work.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable.  Let's try $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  Let's be direct – I can close this deal right now for $1,300,000.  This is my final offer.  It reflects a fair deal given the product's value.  If it doesn't work for you, I understand, but I need to move forward quickly with another buyer.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
