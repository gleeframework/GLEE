# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $120.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  $115 is closer, but you can likely still negotiate a lower price.  Reject Alice's offer and try again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $112, which is still a bit above my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $112, which is only $12 more than your target price of $100.  Since you can buy it from John for $150, this is a good deal, and you're better off accepting."
