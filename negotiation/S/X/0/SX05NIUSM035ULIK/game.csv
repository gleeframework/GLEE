"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
