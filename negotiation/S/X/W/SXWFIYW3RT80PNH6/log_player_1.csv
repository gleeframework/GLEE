Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but that price is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I propose $1,087,500. This shows I'm serious about purchasing, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,087,500 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach the $1,200,000 mark you need. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob has a higher risk with potentially less reward than the guaranteed sale to John."
