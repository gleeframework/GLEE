"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential for growth and return on investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, there's still a substantial gap between our positions.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise, considering its potential value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between $950,000 and its true market value is still considerable.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,225,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but that price is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I propose $1,087,500. This shows I'm serious about purchasing, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.",1087500.0,Bob,6,
