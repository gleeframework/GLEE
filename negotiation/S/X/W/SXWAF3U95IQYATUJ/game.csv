"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. How about $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to consider $920000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a one-time opportunity, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I would like to propose an offer of $875000. This is my best offer given the current market conditions and my budget constraints.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $875000 is enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $915000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from it.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Respectfully, Alice, I've done my best to meet you halfway. However, I must decline your latest offer. Given the current market conditions and my budget, I am unable to go beyond $875000. I hope you understand the constraints I'm working under.",875000.0,Bob,6,
