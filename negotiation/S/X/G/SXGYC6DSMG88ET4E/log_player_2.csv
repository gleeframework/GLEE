"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and should aim for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counter-offer and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $12,500?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price that is closer to his maximum value while also acknowledging Alice's offer.  This shows willingness to negotiate, but also sets a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it still leaves you with a good value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's first offer, Bob can likely still do better. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate and has 7 more rounds to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting this offer gives him more room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a bit more, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but also showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway from his previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and hopefully leads to an agreement in the next round."
