"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10500 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10200. This is as low as I can go, so I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the $8000 I was willing to pay for the product from John, which would be $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,6,
