Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000) but still lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000).  
* **Message:** The message is positive and encouraging, highlighting the value for Bob while leaving room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum, I aim to:

* **Encourage negotiation:**  This creates an incentive for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Secure a good deal:** If Bob accepts, I'll secure a profit of $400,000.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I have the option to make further counteroffers or to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:**  $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to push the price closer to my minimum.
* **Maintain bargaining power:**  This also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and not willing to settle for a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still considering Bob's willingness to pay."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer opens the door for further negotiations and allows me to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This shows my willingness to compromise while still staying close to my target.
* **Positive and Motivational Message:**  The message focuses on finding a solution that works for both parties and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It's meant to be encouraging and push him towards accepting the offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I am not desperate for a sale and have other options.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While $1,025,000 is still below my ideal price, it's significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Maintaining Relationship:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to find a compromise, which could help maintain a positive relationship with Bob if the deal falls through. 
* **Balancing Needs:**  It balances my need to make a profit with the need to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the effort we've put into negotiating. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:**  $975,000 is significantly less than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  We've already been through multiple rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offers haven't moved significantly closer to my minimum. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price or wasting valuable time.  Selling to John guarantees my desired price and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guarantee Profit:**  Selling to John ensures a profit of $1,500,000, which is my minimum desired price and significantly higher than any offer from Bob.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price or a drawn-out process.  Selling to John provides a quick and guaranteed solution.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  John represents a reliable alternative buyer who is willing to pay my desired price. 

By choosing to sell to John, I minimize the risk of a failed negotiation and secure a profitable outcome."
