"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
