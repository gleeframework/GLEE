"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair amount given the value of the product and my budget.  I think this is a reasonable offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'm willing to compromise at $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
