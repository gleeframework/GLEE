Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the $150 floor value and your willingness to offer a special price, you create the perception of value and a potential ""deal"".
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects the $175 offer, you're still guaranteed your minimum price from John."
