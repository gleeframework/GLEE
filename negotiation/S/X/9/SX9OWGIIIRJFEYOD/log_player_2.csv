"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is under your $12,000 limit, you can do better. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $10,000 valuation. You can always fall back on buying from John at $12,000 if needed."
