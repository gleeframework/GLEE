Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be thrilled with it. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $12,000, starting at $18,000 gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Confident tone:**  The message aims to sound persuasive without revealing my minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a backup:** I have the security of John as a buyer at $12,000, so I can afford to be a bit bolder with my initial offer to Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
