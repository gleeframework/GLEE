"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'm aiming to find a price point that's mutually beneficial, while also leaving some room for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe there's still room to negotiate a more favorable price with Bob, as he clearly values the product. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,000,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and might be acceptable to Bob, given his previous offer of $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I don't need to settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000. Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and I believe this price is fair and represents a good compromise. I'm hoping that by maintaining this offer, I can finally reach an agreement with Bob.  If he rejects again, I might consider lowering my offer slightly, but I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000 yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still below my minimum acceptable price, even if it's only by $80,000. I need to consider the time factor here and the fact that I have another buyer who is willing to pay my minimum. While I'd prefer to close with Bob, I need to weigh this against the risk of losing a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

This is a significant concession, but it's still a good price for me.  It's also a signal to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. If he rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a difficult decision, but I'm running out of time. While I prefer to close the deal with Bob, his offer is too far below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made significant concessions. With only two rounds left, the risk of ending up with a much lower price is too high.  

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is crucial for me. It's unfortunate that I can't secure a better price with Bob, but this is the most sensible option given the circumstances."
