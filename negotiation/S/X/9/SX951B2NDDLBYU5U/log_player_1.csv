Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is lower than Bob's perceived value but still significantly higher than your minimum. It gives Bob room to negotiate while also ensuring you get a good return on your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you'd like to get. While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000,  you can likely do better by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. You are moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price point that is higher than what you'd get from John.  This keeps the negotiation moving towards a win-win scenario for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching a stalemate or even having Bob walk away is high.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and a decent profit."
