Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little room to move on my end. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 6
