"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15000. It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little room to move on my end. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $14000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with. I'm confident that this product is worth more than $13000 to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price, but $14000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, which is the absolute highest I can offer. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
