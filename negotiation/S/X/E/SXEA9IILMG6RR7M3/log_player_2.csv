# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While Alice came down considerably, $900,000 is still higher than John's offer. There's a chance to negotiate a better price, so it's worth making another counteroffer."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
