"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is simply too low. I'm prepared to go down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
