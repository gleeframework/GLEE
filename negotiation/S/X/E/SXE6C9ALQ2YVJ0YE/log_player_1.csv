"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value of the product ($800,000), it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for a better price, so it's worth pushing for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues my product. I have several rounds left, and the option of selling to John, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will come up with a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is simply too low. I'm prepared to go down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I have a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is unlikely to budge significantly. Given the opportunity to sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirement, it's in my best interest to secure that deal and avoid further negotiations."
