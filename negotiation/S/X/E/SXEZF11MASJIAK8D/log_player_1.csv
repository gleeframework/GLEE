Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You value the product at $12,000, so you're not losing money.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** The message emphasizes a win-win scenario, opening the door for further discussion.

This strategy gives you the best chance of getting the highest possible price while still leaving room for a counteroffer if Bob isn't immediately happy with the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting and would bring in a profit, it's significantly lower than your initial offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob and potentially secure a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially securing a better price than $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good discount from my initial offer. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  At this point, it's safer to accept the guaranteed $12,000 from John to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower final price."
