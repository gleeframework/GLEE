"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product.
* **Just Below Bob's Value:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000 creates immediate interest and makes the deal seem very appealing to him.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively and invites Bob's feedback, setting the tone for a potentially collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, we are still early in the negotiation. Bob's initial counteroffer being relatively close to our asking price suggests there's room to push for more. We can likely secure a better deal with a well-placed counteroffer.  We'll reject for now and aim to meet somewhere in the middle during the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still pursuing a higher price. By suggesting a middle ground, it appears fair and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** Offering $1,350,000 keeps the negotiation significantly above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and leaves room for further adjustments if needed. 
* **Encouraging a Deal:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing our goal of finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
