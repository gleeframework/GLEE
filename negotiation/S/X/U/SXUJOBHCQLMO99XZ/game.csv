"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me. The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $1,200,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $800,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
