"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  While $1,750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's a realistic starting point that could potentially lead to a successful deal. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low.** It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **I need to stay firm and try to get a better price.**  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a drastic price reduction. 
* **Selling to John is still an option.**  While I'd prefer to get a better price from Bob, John's offer is still a guaranteed way to meet my minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me. The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a reasonable reduction:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,750,000 to $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for me while also acknowledging Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasize the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to make my counteroffer seem more reasonable.
* **Collaborative tone:**  I'm using phrases like ""Let's find a solution"" to create a sense of partnership and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $1,200,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While $800,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough to cover my desired profit margin.
* **I need to stay firm and continue negotiating.**  I believe I can get a better price if I persist.
* **John's offer remains a solid backup.**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $800,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise, but not too much:**  I'm lowering my price again, but I'm keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Focus on the value to Bob:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to make my offer more appealing.
* **Positive and persuasive tone:**  I'm using language like ""Let's make this happen"" to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
