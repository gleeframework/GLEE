"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above his ideal price of $8,000.  He can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice or purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $9,500 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice. He can also choose to buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't go in his favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his target price but Alice is still asking for more than he's willing to pay. With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  He can secure the product for his ideal price of $8,000 from John.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal than risk a potential stalemate with Alice."
