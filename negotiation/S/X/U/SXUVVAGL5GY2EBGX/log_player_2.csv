"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. It's a significant discount from what I've been offered elsewhere, but I see potential in our partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,100,000, which is $300,000 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll look elsewhere for a better deal.
