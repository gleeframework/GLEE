"Bob, I understand your perspective, and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 falls short of the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to find a mutually agreeable solution.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe that $850,000 is a reasonable price given the current market conditions and the potential of the product. I would like to stick to this figure, as it aligns closely with my valuation. If there's any way we could reach an agreement at this price, I'd be very grateful. Looking forward to your response.",850000.0,Bob,4,
