Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  A million dollars is still a considerable sum, but it's a good starting point for bargaining."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better price.  It's important to remember that I can always go with John's offer if I don't get a satisfactory deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is my maximum budget, and if Alice doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer. This move is designed to put pressure on Alice to close the deal, as it's a clear indication of my final position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above my maximum budget.  With only five rounds left, the chances of negotiating a lower price with Alice are slim. It's more beneficial to secure the product from John at my budget limit."
