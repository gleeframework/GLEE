{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. What do you think?"",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value and your confidence in its worth, you provide Bob with a reason to consider a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is significantly higher than your minimum, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. You can then negotiate down towards your desired price.
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of knowing John will purchase the product at your minimum acceptable price, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
