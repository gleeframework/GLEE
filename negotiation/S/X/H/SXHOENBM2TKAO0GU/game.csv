"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,750 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,250. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",11250.0,Alice,5,
