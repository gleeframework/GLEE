Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this price leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for him. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value and are serious about negotiating.

By starting with this offer, you give yourself the best chance of getting a favorable price while also keeping the negotiation open and allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what you initially proposed. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to stand your ground.
* **Potentially get closer to your desired price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you have the chance to negotiate a price closer to your initial $950,000. 

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You should counter with a price closer to your desired $950,000 but lower than your initial offer. For example, $900,000. This signals a willingness to compromise but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise from your initial $950,000 while still leaving significant profit for you. 
* **Maintain leverage:** $900,000 is still a good price for Bob, who values the product at $1,000,000, giving him an incentive to accept. 
* **Stay within your range:**  This offer keeps you within your desired price range, avoiding a sale at a price that is too low.

This counteroffer provides a good balance between maintaining your profit margin and reaching a potential agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what you initially hoped to achieve.  At this point, the negotiation is starting to drag on, and there's a risk that:

* **Bob will continue to lower his offers.**  He's shown a willingness to negotiate downwards, and there's no guarantee he won't offer even less in the future.
* **Negotiations could become protracted.**  This could take up valuable time and effort without any guarantee of a favorable outcome.

**Selling to John offers several advantages:**

* **Guaranteed sale:**  John is a guaranteed buyer, offering a certain and quick sale.
* **Minimizes risk:**  While $800,000 is less than ideal, it's still a decent profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Saves time and effort:**  It allows you to move on to other opportunities without wasting time on a potentially fruitless negotiation.

Given the current state of the negotiation, selling to John is the most logical and practical decision, minimizing risk and providing a quick, reliable sale."
