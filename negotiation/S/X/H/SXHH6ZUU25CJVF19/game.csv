"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've expressed interest in. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party willing to pay $1,000,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
