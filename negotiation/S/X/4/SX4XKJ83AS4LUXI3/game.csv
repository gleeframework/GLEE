"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to me, but still allows you to make a good profit.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $12,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering you value the product at $8,000, and it's closer to the price I need to make this work. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,750. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. To make this work, I need to stay at $10,250. This is a compromise that will get us both to a fair deal.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation, so let's find common ground. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that we're nearing the end of the negotiation, but I'm still a bit away from my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9900.0,Bob,8,
