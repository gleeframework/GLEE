$200 is way over my budget. I'll try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's price, hoping to get her to come down. $60 is still a decent value for me, but it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is closer to my budget, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still hoping to save a few bucks. $75 is a good compromise, and I think Alice might be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$100 is still a bit too high. I'll make one last counteroffer and if it gets rejected, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay John's price, but I'd prefer to get it from Alice if she's willing to meet me halfway."
