"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested in the product, $800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $700,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000.  Let's try to bridge that gap and make this happen.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $675,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a way to make this work.",675000.0,Alice,5,
