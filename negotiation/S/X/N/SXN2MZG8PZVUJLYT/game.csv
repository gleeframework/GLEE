"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but  $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
