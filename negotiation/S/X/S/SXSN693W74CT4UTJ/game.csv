"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8500 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $9500, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
