Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $100 to Bob, so we need to offer a price significantly lower than that to entice him.
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:**  We have a safety net with John who will buy the product for $150. This means we don't have to go below $150 in our offer to Bob.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, we can always lower it slightly before resorting to selling to John. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's essential to consider the potential impact on your relationship with Bob. A very high offer might be perceived as unfair."
