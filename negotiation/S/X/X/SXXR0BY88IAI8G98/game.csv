"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",1300000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $900000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1100000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1100000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at that price. I'd like to make one final offer of $1100000. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",1100000.0,Bob,6,,
