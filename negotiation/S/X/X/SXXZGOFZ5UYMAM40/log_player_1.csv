"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000 to give myself some room to negotiate. I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so I'm aiming for a price within that range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000.  This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his potential value of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to close the deal, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he refuses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,550,000. This is closer to my minimum, but it's still a good deal for me. I believe that Bob will accept this offer as it's higher than his current offer, but still below his estimated value of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation and Bob is still not meeting my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
