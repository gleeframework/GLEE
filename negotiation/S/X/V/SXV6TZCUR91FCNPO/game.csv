"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer $900,000. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my budget.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me. The product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident you'll realize its value in the long run. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our needs and represents a great opportunity for you. Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
