"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer $900,000. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me. The product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident you'll realize its value in the long run. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our needs and represents a great opportunity for you. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to reach a point where it's significantly better than John's offer. John is offering the product at your absolute maximum budget ($1,000,000). It's better to secure the product at your target price than to risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially miss out on both options."
