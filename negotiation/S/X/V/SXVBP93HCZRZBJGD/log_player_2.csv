"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $140. While that's a good deal, you can likely get it for a lower price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm not sure I can go that high. Would you be willing to take $130 for it? I'm really interested in the product, but that's the most I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice is now offering it for $135.  It's a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy it from John for $150."
