Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than your minimum of $120.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  There's room for negotiation as Bob values the product at $150.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to discuss the price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm not sure I can go that high. Would you be willing to take $130 for it? I'm really interested in the product, but that's the most I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to earn.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and push for a higher price. You can counteroffer with a price slightly lower than your initial offer, showing you're willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By lowering your price slightly, you're showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""fair price"" for both parties and highlights the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By not accepting Bob's initial counteroffer, you've shown you're not desperate for a quick sale. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while maintaining a higher price than Bob's offer."
