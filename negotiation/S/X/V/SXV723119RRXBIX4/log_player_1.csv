"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" sets the stage for a negotiation where the price is a key factor.
* **Psychology:** Offering a seemingly high but not outrageous number might make Bob take the offer more seriously than a lower, more tempting price.  It gives the impression that the product is highly sought after. 

This is just the first move in a strategic negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my valuation of the product and your need to sell. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum. I have room to negotiate and time is on my side. Selling to John right now would be the safest option, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your position, but the value of this product to the right buyer is far greater than your initial offer reflects.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I'm making a significant concession to signal that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still keeping the price well above Bob's offer to provide room for further bargaining. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's high value, subtly reminding Bob that he could be missing out on a valuable opportunity if we don't reach an agreement.
* **Framing:** Presenting it as a ""fair deal"" aims to create a sense of partnership and encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm confident that this product holds great value, but I need to stay within a more realistic price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a serious offer and a good compromise given our respective positions. Let me know if you're open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly getting closer to my bottom line, but $1,400,000 is still below my absolute minimum.  While selling to John is looking more appealing, I'm willing to play one more round to see if I can push Bob a bit further. There's still a chance to make a deal that's better than my guaranteed option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions.  My final offer is $1,750,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal with you."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Competition:**  Introducing the idea of another buyer creates a sense of urgency and competition. It subtly reminds Bob that this opportunity won't last forever.
* **Transparency and Value:**  By being transparent about the other offer (without revealing the exact amount), I'm building trust and emphasizing that my asking price is justified. 
* **Finality:** Stating this is my ""final offer"" signals that I'm serious and not willing to go much lower. 
* **Compromise:** I'm splitting the difference between my last offer and his last offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway for a deal. 

This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He now needs to decide if he's willing to meet my price or risk losing the product entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still confident I'm the right fit for this product. While I appreciate your compromise, $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to reconsider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has not budged from his $1,400,000 offer, indicating he's unlikely to go any higher. It's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum.  

While I could try to counter again, it's becoming too risky. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is a sure thing and exceeds Bob's offer. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
