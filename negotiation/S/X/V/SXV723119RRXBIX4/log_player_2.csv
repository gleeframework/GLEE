Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my valuation of the product and your need to sell. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your position, but the value of this product to the right buyer is far greater than your initial offer reflects.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth rejecting and seeing if she'll come down further. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to pay anything close to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm confident that this product holds great value, but I need to stay within a more realistic price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a serious offer and a good compromise given our respective positions. Let me know if you're open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions.  My final offer is $1,750,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal with you.

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth rejecting and seeing if she'll come down further, or if she'll accept my previous counteroffer. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not going to pay more than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still confident I'm the right fit for this product. While I appreciate your compromise, $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to reconsider."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
