Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Offering it at $1,400,000 allows us to capture a significant portion of that value while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($100,000).
* **Balancing Risk:** While we could aim higher, getting greedy increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If Bob declines, we have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 
* **Strategic Communication:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and presents the price as a special opportunity. The ""limited-time"" element adds a sense of urgency."
