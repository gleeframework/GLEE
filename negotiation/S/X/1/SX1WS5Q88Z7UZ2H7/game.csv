"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its significance.  I'm asking for $950,000. This represents a substantial savings for you and allows me to achieve a fair price. Please consider this offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to purchase at $800,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
