"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I think this is a fair offer, considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, based on my assessment and budget, I am unable to meet the price of $900000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me is $800000. I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've given this careful consideration, and I am still unable to meet the price of $875000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860000. I believe this is a closer compromise to both our positions. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $880000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
