Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The negotiations have reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm still hoping to get a better price, I don't want to risk losing out on the sale entirely. Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
