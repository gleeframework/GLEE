{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging. It highlights the product's value to me and frames the offer as a good deal for Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A low initial offer will encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects, I can raise the price slightly in counteroffers, while still being above my minimum value.
* **Set a Strong Starting Position:**  The offer clearly shows I'm serious about selling but also sets a firm baseline. 

I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:** I believe I can get a better price than $9,000. 
* **I have a fallback option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my leverage:**  Showing I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Explore a higher price:**  I can counteroffer at a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Avoid a loss:** Accepting $9,000 would be a significant loss compared to my minimum value.

I'll proceed with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $10,500? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to meet my minimum requirements."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer. It demonstrates flexibility while still prioritizing my financial goals.
* **Highlighting the Deal:** I emphasize that $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to consider it.
* **Maintaining a Professional Tone:** I'm remaining polite and open to finding a solution that works for both of us.

This approach aims to:

* **Increase the Chances of Agreement:**  Meeting in the middle increases the likelihood that Bob will accept, avoiding further negotiations.
* **Minimize Risk:**  $10,500 is significantly closer to my desired value, reducing the risk of selling at a lower price.
* **Keep the Negotiation Moving Forward:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm showing my commitment to reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,800 is still below my minimum value of $15,000 and significantly lower than my counteroffer of $10,500.
* **Negotiations are becoming tiresome:**  Further negotiations with Bob seem unlikely to yield a price closer to my desired value.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 provides a guaranteed outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiations. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to a more lucrative deal with John."
