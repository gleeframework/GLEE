"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations and productivity. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $15,000 to you. My offer to you is $12,000 for this exceptional product. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire it at a price that is beneficial for both of us. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing your upper limit is $15,000. While $12,000 is a significant discount from her initial statement, it's still a long way from John's $15,000 offer. By rejecting her offer, we might be able to negotiate a better price or confidently purchase from John knowing we've explored other options."
