"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $120. Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,165.0
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $137.50? I'm eager to get this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is the lowest I can go. This is the best price I can offer.",150.0,Alice,5,,
