Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you'll find great value in it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price higher than $10,000 but lower than an unreasonable amount (like $20,000) allows room for negotiation while still aiming for maximum profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate down slightly, but remember your bottom line is $10,000. 
* **Information is Key:** This scenario assumes limited information. If you knew more about Bob's willingness to pay, you could adjust your strategy accordingly."
