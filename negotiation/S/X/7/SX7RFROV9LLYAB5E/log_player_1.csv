Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $120 signals that you're willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he values it. His response will dictate your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own stated value for the product ($80). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this low offer, you signal that you're looking for a fairer deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  While you're compromising, the $90 counteroffer is still a profitable price for you and closer to your desired outcome.
* **Test Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and how flexible he is willing to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is slightly below your ideal price, it's still a profitable offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether, especially since he's nearing your minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
