Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $9,500, but am open to discussing a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high initially to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price slightly lower than Bob's maximum allows room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim high with Bob.
* **Polite and Open Communication:**  The message strikes a balance between being direct about the sale and open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
