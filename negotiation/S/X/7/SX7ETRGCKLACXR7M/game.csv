"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm open to negotiating, $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price acknowledges your concerns while still allowing me to receive a fair return.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $1300000? This price reflects a compromise, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1290000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1290000.0,Bob,6,
