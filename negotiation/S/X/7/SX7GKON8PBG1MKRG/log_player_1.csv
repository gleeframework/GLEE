"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm not just stating a price, I'm trying to build some justification for it. This makes the initial offer seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion. This encourages him to counteroffer rather than simply rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it holds.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Reasonable Price:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Reiterate Value and Potential:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to reinforce the reasoning behind my counteroffer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that a deal benefits both of us, to encourage a cooperative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1700000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1400000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired threshold. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can bridge the gap, but I'm also considering selling to John as a backup option if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, and I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to accept $1,550,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it also reflects the potential value I see in you as a customer.  Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's just slightly above my minimum. This shows I'm serious about closing a deal but won't go lower.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the potential value of the product to Bob, even though this might not be his primary concern.
* **Customer Focus:** I'm emphasizing that I see potential in him as a customer. This can create a sense of goodwill and encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency Implied:** The ""let's close this deal"" language suggests a sense of urgency, which might push Bob to act."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. I'm ready to offer $1500000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, but it's also a fair price considering the value and potential of the product. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to secure the deal at this point. I've already made significant concessions, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely. It's time to close this deal and move forward."
