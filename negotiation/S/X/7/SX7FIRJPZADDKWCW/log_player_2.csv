Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $780,000 is still a bit low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to drop to $805,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a chance for you to secure a valuable asset.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $805,000.

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below John's price of $800,000. Continuing the negotiation poses a risk of either getting a price higher than John's offer or having the negotiation fail altogether. It's strategically wiser to secure the product from John at the known price."
