{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum value of $800,000.  A counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and provides a starting point for further negotiation. This allows Bob to maximize savings while still potentially securing a deal with Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's latest offer of $900,000. A counteroffer of $875,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his desired range. This strategy aims to increase the chances of Alice accepting the offer and securing a deal that benefits both parties."
