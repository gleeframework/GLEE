Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that leaves room for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit. I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and how many rounds remain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I still believe there's room for a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have other options. I'm confident I can get a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm offering $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving some margin for profit. I'm aiming for a quick close, as the rounds are limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close to it and guarantees a sale within the limited rounds.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower price or even a deal falling through.  With only 6 rounds left, it's wiser to secure a good price now than to risk losing a sale altogether."
