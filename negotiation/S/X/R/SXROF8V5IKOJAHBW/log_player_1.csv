Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This is a good starting point as it's  significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to sell to him for $100, I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to $120. This is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, and considering the potential of further negotiation, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and sell the product to him.  There's always a chance of getting a slightly higher price in further rounds, but the risk of losing a sale to John for $100 isn't worth it."
