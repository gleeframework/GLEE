"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it very useful. How about a starting price of $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a significantly lower counteroffer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Engaged:** The message aims to keep the negotiation going by being polite and expressing continued interest.
* **Target in Mind:** While the offer is low, remember that your goal is to get the product for as close to $80 (your maximum) as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still significantly higher than both your target price and what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer or settling closer to Alice's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand it's valuable to you, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer demonstrates willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still aiming for a price below your maximum.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This phrasing is a common negotiation tactic, suggesting fairness and encouraging agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is halfway between your last offer ($60) and Alice's last offer ($130). It gives you both room to negotiate further while staying within a reasonable range of your target."
