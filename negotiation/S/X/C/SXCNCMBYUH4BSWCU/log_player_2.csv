"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer:**  This would result in you paying $1,200,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** This would lead you to buy from John at $1,200,000.

Since both options result in the same price, it makes no difference whether you accept or reject Alice's offer. However, the prompt states your goal is to save as much money as possible. You can't save any money in this scenario, but you can at least avoid the negotiation process with Alice. Therefore, the optimal choice is to simply buy from John."
