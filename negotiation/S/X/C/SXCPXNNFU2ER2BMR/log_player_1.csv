"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $1,400,000, you're positioning the product closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, making it more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** This offer gives you space to make concessions in subsequent rounds while still staying above your minimum price of $1,200,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product.  Rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer allows me to potentially negotiate for a higher price, closer to $1,350,000.  I'm willing to engage in further negotiation before accepting an offer that's $100,000 below my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. Considering the value this product offers, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,300,000). This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The language emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution, fostering a collaborative spirit and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can come up with a proposal that works for both of us. How about considering $1,320,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit Margin:** This price still gives me a profit of $120,000 over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away or that we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner, allowing me to reinvest it or use it for other opportunities. 

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $1,200,000 isn't worth it at this point."
