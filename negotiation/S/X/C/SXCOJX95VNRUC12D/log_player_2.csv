**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly stuck on keeping the price above $700,000.  She's rejected my ""final offer"" and countered with another price above that threshold. It's unlikely she'll move significantly in the last round. Buying from John at $1,000,000, while not ideal, prevents me from potentially paying even more with Alice in the final round."
