"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at a steal - just $180. I know you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product while being clear about budget limitations.
* **Targeting a Good Deal:**  While we'd pay $80 to John, aiming for $60 from Alice attempts to secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I understand you have a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fantastic deal for a product you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice is sticking close to her product's value to her ($120). This is way above our budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're still in early rounds. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open.
* **John as Backup:**  We can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $120 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we try $70? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Gradually:** We're increasing our offer to show willingness to negotiate, but not by a large amount.
* **Staying Below John:** We're still aiming for a better price than John's $80 offer.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** The message reinforces the desire to find a mutually agreeable deal."
