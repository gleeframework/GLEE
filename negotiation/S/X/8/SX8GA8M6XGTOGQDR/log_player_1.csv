"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at a steal - just $180. I know you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I understand you have a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fantastic deal for a product you'll love."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $120 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we try $70? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While it's tempting to continue negotiating with Bob, it's clear his price range is significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely we'll reach a deal that's acceptable to both of us. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further haggling."
