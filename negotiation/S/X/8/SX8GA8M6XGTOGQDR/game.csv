"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I understand you have a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fantastic deal for a product you'll love.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $120 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we try $70? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
