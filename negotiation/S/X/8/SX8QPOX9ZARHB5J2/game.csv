"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To be honest, $13000 is really pushing it for me.  However, I want to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $13250 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable purchase.  What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go lower than $13250.  However, to show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to offer a small discount for a quick sale. I'll drop the price to $13125. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. ",13125.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I'm afraid $13125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, and that's my final offer. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",13000.0,Bob,8,
