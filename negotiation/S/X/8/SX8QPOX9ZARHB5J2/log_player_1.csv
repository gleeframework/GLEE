"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and sets the tone for a favorable deal for me.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him that $14,000 is a good price for him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not asking for the full $15,000 right away. This allows Bob to counter-offer and keeps the negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While I want to get closer to my target, there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **More Rounds Available:** I have 9 rounds remaining, giving me time to explore other options and potentially improve the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to drop to $13,500. This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is a Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm price. 
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, making it clear that my price is justified.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm focusing on the ""fairness"" of the deal for both parties to create a sense of collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **I Have Time:** I have 6 rounds remaining, giving me time to explore other options and potentially improve the offer.
* **Sell to John as Last Resort:**  While $15,000 is my ideal, I'm not going to jump at the first offer that's a little below my minimum, especially when I have other options available. If negotiations fall through, I'll consider selling to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To be honest, $13,000 is really pushing it for me.  However, I want to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $13,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable purchase.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between our last offers. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize the Deal's Value:** I'm focusing on the ""value"" and ""fairness"" of the deal to encourage Bob to see the benefits of accepting.
* **Finality:** I'm framing this as a potential final offer, creating a sense of urgency to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to discuss a small discount for a quick sale. Is there any wiggle room in your price?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  While I have only 4 rounds left, I'm not in a rush to sell at a price that is significantly lower than my desired value.
* **John is My Backup:** I know that selling to John for $15,000 is always an option if I don't reach an acceptable agreement with Bob. 

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a possible fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go lower than $13,250.  However, to show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to offer a small discount for a quick sale. I'll drop the price to $13,125. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. "", ""product_price"": 13125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a discount, but I'm not giving in completely. 
* **Final Offer:**  This creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he needs to act now or risk losing the deal.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small concession, but I'm still above my minimum price.
* **Focus on Quick Sale:** I'm emphasizing the ""quick sale"" aspect to further entice Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I'm afraid $13125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, and that's my final offer. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  I have only two rounds left, and Bob is not willing to budge on his price.
* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only slightly above my absolute minimum. While I'd prefer more, there's a high chance we'll end up at this price if I keep negotiating. 
* **Secure a Better Deal:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly more than what I can reasonably expect from Bob at this point.  

It's time to cut my losses and secure the better deal with John. It's not ideal to accept a price so close to my minimum, but it's the most logical decision given the circumstances."
