"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll get good use out of it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
