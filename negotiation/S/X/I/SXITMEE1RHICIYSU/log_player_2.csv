Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $1,400,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.

Alice's offer is still above your budget, though closer to what you're willing to pay. Since you're able to get the product from John for your maximum price, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You might be able to get her down further."
