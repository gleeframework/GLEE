"Hi Alice,  $2000000 is far beyond my budget. While I see the value in your product, I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $1200000? This would give you a significant value for the product and still allow me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at least $1300000 to make this worthwhile. This is a significant investment for you, and the product's value will only increase over time. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
