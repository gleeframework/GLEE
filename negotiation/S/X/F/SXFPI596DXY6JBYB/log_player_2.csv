Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further back-and-forth."
