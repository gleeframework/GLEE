"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $135, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested, but would you be willing to come down to $125?  Let's see if we can make this work!",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I can't quite go down to $125, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $130?  That's still a good price for you and it helps me get closer to my desired value.  Let's close this deal!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $128. This would be a good deal for both of us - I get a great product, and you're still getting a decent price. Let me know what you think!",128.0,Bob,4,
