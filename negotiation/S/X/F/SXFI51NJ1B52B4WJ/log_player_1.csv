{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close the deal, selling for $6,000 would be a huge loss for me.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's still above Bob's valuation but closer to my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $8,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $8,500 and Bob's current offer of $7,250. This shows my commitment to finding a compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm continuing to be polite and emphasize the mutual benefit of the deal.  I'm hoping that this fair compromise will convince Bob to accept."
