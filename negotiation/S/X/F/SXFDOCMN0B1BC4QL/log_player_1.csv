Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob might counter-offer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is close enough to my desired value. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with only John's offer of $800,000. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for me."
