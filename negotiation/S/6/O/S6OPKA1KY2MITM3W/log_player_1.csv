Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay. Since the product is worth $100 to him, offering it just below $120 might entice him.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, there's no loss. 
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** Offering $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially pushing the price a bit higher. 

**Important Note:**  This assumes there's no opportunity for further negotiation with John. If there was, a different strategy might be employed."
