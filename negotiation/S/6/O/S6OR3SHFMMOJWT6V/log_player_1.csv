Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher price.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffer might be closer to your desired range than if you started lower. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, starting high gives you a chance to potentially earn even more. You can always accept John's offer later if negotiations with Bob don't go as well.

**Important:** This is just the opening move. How you proceed will depend on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is tempting as it's above his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and your initial offer. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, you can try to push the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the value this product brings, I could come down to $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You've significantly lowered your price from $13,500 to $12,000, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer keeps you comfortably above your $10,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer will help you better understand how serious Bob is about the product and how much room for negotiation remains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding the Safety Net:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is now higher than John's standing offer of $10,000.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** You've successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offer of $9,500.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and you risk him walking away. 

Taking the $10,500 offer secures a profit above your minimum and avoids the potential risk of further negotiation."
