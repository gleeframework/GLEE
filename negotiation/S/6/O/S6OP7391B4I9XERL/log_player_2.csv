**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to his desired range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1,150,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $1,180,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is closer to his budget, it's still slightly above what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his desired range.  The risk is that Alice could reject Bob's counteroffer and Bob might have to pay John's price of $1,200,000. However, the potential savings of $20,000 justifies taking the risk."
