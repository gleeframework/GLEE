,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $10,500. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
