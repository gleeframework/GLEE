Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I would like to counter with a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I can likely get a higher price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe $10,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to that figure if possible. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm running out of time, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. He's not budging, and I think I can likely get a higher price if I keep negotiating. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for you, and allows me to make a profit.
