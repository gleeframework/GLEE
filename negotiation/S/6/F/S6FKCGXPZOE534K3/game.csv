"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $12500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to 12500 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go down to 13000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 13750?",13750.0,Alice,5,
