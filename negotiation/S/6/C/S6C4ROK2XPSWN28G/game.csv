"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $10,800 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget of $10,000, and I think this price is a good compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're working within your budget, $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need at least $11,200 for this product. This is still below my minimum value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $10,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
