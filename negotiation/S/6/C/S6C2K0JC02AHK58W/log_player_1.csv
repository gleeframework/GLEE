Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum price of $8,000. I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay this as the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's higher than John's offer, I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,500.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still a good price for me, and it might be enough to persuade Bob to accept."
