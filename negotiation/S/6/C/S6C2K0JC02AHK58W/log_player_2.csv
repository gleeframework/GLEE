"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $9,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $11,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it still leaves some room for Alice to profit while offering Bob a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While there's always a possibility of getting an even lower price, the risk of further negotiation could lead to Alice rejecting the offer and leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for Bob."
