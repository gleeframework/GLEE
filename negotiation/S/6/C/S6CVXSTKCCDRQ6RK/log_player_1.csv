Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is significantly more than your minimum of $8,000, giving you a comfortable starting point.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $9,500 is still less than what Bob values the product at ($10,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** By offering a price lower than your ideal, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 

This offer gives you a good chance of getting a deal with Bob while still earning a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still a significant drop from your initial offer. Rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a price that's more favorable to you.  There's still a chance Bob will accept a higher price, and you can always fall back on selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,200 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and go with $8,850?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8850}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise for several reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're not willing to accept his initial price.
* **It's lower than your previous offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's a fair compromise:** By splitting the difference, you're showing that you're willing to meet in the middle. 

This counteroffer gives you a good chance of reaching a deal with Bob while still getting a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,850 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,400. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than what you would ideally like, it's still a decent profit and a better deal than selling to John for $8,000. Accepting Bob's offer avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price or even a complete breakdown in negotiations. It's important to recognize that sometimes a good deal is a deal that gets you closer to your goal, even if it's not perfect."
