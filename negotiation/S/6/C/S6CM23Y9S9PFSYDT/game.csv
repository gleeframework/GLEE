"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $125, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a limit, but $130 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $127, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",127.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about we meet at $132?,132.0,Alice,7,
