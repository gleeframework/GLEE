Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quicker.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
