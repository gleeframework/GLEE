Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $100, so $115 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $120, so you have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum selling price of $120. You have room to negotiate further, and you're better off seeing if you can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $110. It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a bit of profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is still below your minimum selling price of $120. While $107.50 is a better offer than his previous one, it's not enough to make a profit.  John is offering a guaranteed $120, so it's the smarter choice to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
