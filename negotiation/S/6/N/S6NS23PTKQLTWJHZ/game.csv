"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while ensuring you get a great deal on a valuable product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm eager to reach a deal.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms of the deal. Would you be open to discussing a possible discount or other benefits to make up for the difference?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue exploring options with you. However, I'm not comfortable with the proposed 'discount or other benefits' as they're too vague and uncertain.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,700, which is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer, considering we're running out of time.",10700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're running out of time, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, and I'm willing to pay a small premium for the product. I'm not budging from this price, so I hope we can agree on this.",10500.0,Bob,8,
