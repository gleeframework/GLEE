Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price than what John is offering.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction carefully to see if he's interested and how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum value, I believe the product is worth more than $8,000.  I'm going to try and get closer to my initial offer by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a decent price considering my minimum value of $8,000 and the fact that I'm already in the third round of negotiation.  While I would prefer more, accepting his offer is the best option at this point.  I'm not convinced I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round and selling to John for $8,000 wouldn't be as profitable."
