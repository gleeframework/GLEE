Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I believe it offers significant value, especially considering it's worth $120 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $80 (my minimum).
* **Avoid Scarcity Tactics:** While mentioning John might pressure Bob, it could also make him feel manipulated and less likely to engage in a fair negotiation."
