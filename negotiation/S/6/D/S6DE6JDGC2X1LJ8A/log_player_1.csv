Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. How about $11,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
