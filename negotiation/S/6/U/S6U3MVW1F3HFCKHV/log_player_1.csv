Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I can stretch to $10,750. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is incrementally increasing his offer. While I could push for a slightly higher price, we're getting close to the point where the risk of him walking away outweighs the potential gain. $10,750 is a strong profit margin, and it's better to secure the deal now."
