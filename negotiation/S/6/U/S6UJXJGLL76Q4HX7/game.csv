"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try $925,000.  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my value for the product.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
