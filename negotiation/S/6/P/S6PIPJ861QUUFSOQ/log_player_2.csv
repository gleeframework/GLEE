# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment, and I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. It's a price that reflects its value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This allows us both to secure a good deal. Let's find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,175,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,212,500? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,212,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your eagerness to proceed, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,190,000 is still below the value I've set for this product.

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price above $1,190,000.  Her latest offer of $1,200,000 is a good compromise and saves you a significant amount compared to John's offer.  It's time to close the deal."
