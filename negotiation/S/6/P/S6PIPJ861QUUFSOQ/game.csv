"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment, and I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. It's a price that reflects its value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? That feels like a fairer price point to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This allows us both to secure a good deal. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more affordable.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? That feels like a good middle ground where we can both feel positive about the deal.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,175,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,212,500? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,190,000. I'm hoping we can find an agreement soon, as I'd like to get moving on this project.",1190000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your eagerness to proceed, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,190,000 is still below the value I've set for this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 as a final concession. This price represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to move forward. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
