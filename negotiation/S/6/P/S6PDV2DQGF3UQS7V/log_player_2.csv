# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It aligns perfectly with your current needs and could potentially generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. I'm confident that this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
