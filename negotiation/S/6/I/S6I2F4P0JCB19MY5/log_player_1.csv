I'm starting with a high price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this will make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal while still being profitable for me.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I would like. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer at $1,050,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still leaving a decent margin for me. Hopefully, this will be a more acceptable price for him, while still securing a substantial profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not satisfactory. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push for a higher price. If Bob still refuses, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final attempt to negotiate with Bob. I'm offering $975,000, which is very close to his offer. I'm hoping he recognizes that this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally reach an agreement. If he rejects this offer, I'll be happy to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's clearly not willing to budge much higher, and I'm not comfortable dropping below my minimum price.  John is a reliable buyer who will pay my minimum, so I'll go with him and secure my desired profit."
