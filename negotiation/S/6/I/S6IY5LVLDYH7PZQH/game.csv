"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's potential. However, given our company's current financial situation, we're looking to keep our investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still leaves room for profit for both of us, while also ensuring I can achieve my desired financial outcome.",950000.0,Alice,3,
