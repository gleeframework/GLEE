"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price. I know you're a serious buyer and I value your business, so I'm willing to be flexible on the price. If you're interested, let's chat further about the details.  However, I do have other interested parties, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
