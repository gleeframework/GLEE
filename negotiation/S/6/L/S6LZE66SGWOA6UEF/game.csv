"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a revised offer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come close to your original price. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,4,
