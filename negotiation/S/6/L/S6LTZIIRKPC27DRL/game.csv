,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counteroffer at $950000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1050000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I need to be closer to my target. I'll counteroffer at $980000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
