Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my highest possible price, knowing it's worth $100 to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $100. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 than my last counteroffer of $110.  While it's not ideal, it's still a good deal, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome. It's also a risk to keep going as Bob might just walk away at this point."
