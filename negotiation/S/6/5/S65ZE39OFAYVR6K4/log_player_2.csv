"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly emphasizing the product's value *to you*, suggesting she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you signal that the price isn't ideal and open the door for further negotiation."
