"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it.  Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we try $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to make one last concession. I can do $850,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
