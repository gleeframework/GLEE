Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me a good chance to earn a high price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still attractive to Bob, but also reflects the value of the product to me. I'm hoping he'll accept this counteroffer, but if not, I'll continue to negotiate until we reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to continue negotiating further.  Selling to John at $12,000 guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
