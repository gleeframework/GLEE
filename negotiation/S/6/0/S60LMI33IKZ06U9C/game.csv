"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, as you've stated it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $16,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $14,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you given the product's value.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $15,750.
