"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I have to say that's a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
