"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I have to say that's a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:**  $11,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's price of $12,000.
* **Middle Ground:**  Alice has met Bob halfway, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's always a chance for a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially since Alice has stated it's her lowest offer."
