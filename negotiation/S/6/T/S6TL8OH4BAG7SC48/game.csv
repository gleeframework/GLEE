"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $12,000? It's still a significant value for you, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $11,250? That's a good compromise.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue exploring a fair price. However, $11,250 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $12,500 as a final offer. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product for a reasonable price while ensuring I can cover my costs. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
