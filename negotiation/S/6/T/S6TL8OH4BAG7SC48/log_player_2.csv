Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $12,000? It's still a significant value for you, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to go down to $12,500 as a final offer. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product for a reasonable price while ensuring I can cover my costs. What do you think?

It seems unlikely Alice will go below $12,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John at $10,000 makes more sense than potentially wasting more time negotiating with Alice."
