"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle at $14000.  This price still leaves some room for profit while remaining within a reasonable range for you. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
