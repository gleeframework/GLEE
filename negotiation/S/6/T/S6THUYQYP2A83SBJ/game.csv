"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know you value it at that price as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get to make a little extra.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
