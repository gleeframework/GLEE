"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $115? I'm willing to close the deal at that price.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $115 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it for that price elsewhere. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,4,
