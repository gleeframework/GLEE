Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's less than his perceived value) while maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder in your offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Profit Maximization:** This price nets you a $250,000 profit, significantly more than your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Attractive to Bob:** Bob is still getting a $50,000 discount from his perceived value, making it likely he'll accept.
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob wants to negotiate, you have a little wiggle room to come down slightly while still exceeding your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or any time pressure he might be under."
