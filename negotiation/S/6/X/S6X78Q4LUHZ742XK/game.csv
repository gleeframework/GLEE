"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product but I'm not sure I can justify paying $7,500.  How about $7,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $7,800. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and I think it's a good compromise.",7800.0,Alice,3,
