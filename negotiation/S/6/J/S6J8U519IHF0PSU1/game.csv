"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,600,000?  This price is still fair considering the product's value, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this transaction.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
