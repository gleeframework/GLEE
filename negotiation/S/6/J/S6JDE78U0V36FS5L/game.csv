"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $105 for the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $115 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $110 for the product.  I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $110. I can offer it to you for $112.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product!",112.5,Alice,5,
