Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see significant value in.  I'm asking for $925,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. This is crucial information.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so any amount above that is a win.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, you increase the chances of a sale closer to Bob's perceived value while still securing a significant profit."
