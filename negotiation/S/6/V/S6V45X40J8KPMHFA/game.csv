"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,700,000. This reflects the true worth while still offering you a competitive advantage.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see the value, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could make a move up to $1,150,000.  Would that work for you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point.  To be candid, the $1,500,000 mark is my absolute minimum to ensure a fair deal.  Considering this, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and I understand this is your bottom line.  However, I can't justify going above $1,200,000.  If you can meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
