"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time. I'm happy to consider a price of $1000000. This is a fair offer, reflecting the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. I've given it some thought, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can see the value in the product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise, considering the original price I had in mind. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1275000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to get closer to your minimum price.  However,  $1275000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1225000 as a final compromise.  This offer is very close to what I'm willing to pay and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1225000 is enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find common ground. I can sell the product to you for $1250000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
