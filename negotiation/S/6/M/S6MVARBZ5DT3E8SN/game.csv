"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $110. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you think the product is worth less, but $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  Let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $100 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, so I'm offering $97.50 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",97.5,Bob,6,
