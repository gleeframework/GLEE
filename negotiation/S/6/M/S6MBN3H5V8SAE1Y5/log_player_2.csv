"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent price, you can do better. Alice is clearly willing to part with the product for less than you're willing to pay. By rejecting this offer, you encourage Alice to potentially come back with a lower price that's still profitable for her."
