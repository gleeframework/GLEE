Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is around $8,000 to you.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire for a fair compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, as I mentioned before, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly set at $11,500. While I could push for more, it's getting riskier. Accepting now secures a profit of $3,500, which is significant. Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and risks ending up with John's offer of $8,000."
