"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $900,000.

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground!",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000 to you. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this game-changing technology.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $887,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $915,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this game-changing technology.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $915,000 is still a bit above where I'd like to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us and I think we could finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
