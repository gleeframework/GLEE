"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer gives Bob a clear incentive to counteroffer, allowing us to haggle towards a mutually beneficial price.
* **Considering John:**  While $1,150,000 is a good price, I'm keeping in mind that I can always go with John's offer of $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm confident I can push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a slight concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:** It also positions us in the middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'm aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both parties, maximizing my profit while ensuring the deal goes through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of going further and possibly ending up with John's offer is significant. 
* **Value for Bob:** It's clear Bob is willing to pay a significant amount, so there's a good chance we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement in the next few rounds.

**While I'm happy with $1,090,000, I believe there's still room to negotiate a slightly higher price. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer at this stage, but I will aim to push for a higher price in the next round if I have the opportunity.**"
