Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product exclusively to you before listing it publicly. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), you want to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $95 offers Bob a small discount compared to its value to him ($80), making it more tempting while still securing a good profit for you. 
* **Exclusivity Incentive:** By framing the offer as exclusive and time-sensitive, you add a subtle pressure for Bob to accept before he potentially misses out."
