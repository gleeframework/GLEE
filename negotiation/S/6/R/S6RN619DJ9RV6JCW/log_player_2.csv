"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly lower than my upper limit, indicating room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still a reasonable markup from her perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while aiming for a good deal.
* **Polite and Engaged:**  The message maintains a positive tone and expresses continued interest, fostering a collaborative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested. While I understand your offer, $105 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $115.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice met me halfway between our previous offers, which is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Time Value:** Further haggling might yield a slightly better price, but the potential savings are small compared to the risk of Alice walking away or the certainty of paying John $150."
