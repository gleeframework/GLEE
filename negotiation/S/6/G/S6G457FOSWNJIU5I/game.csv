"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its true value. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I need to see some flexibility on your part. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is the highest I'm willing to go at this point. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product and the limited time we have left in this negotiation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement before I have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a 12.5% discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's close this deal before time runs out.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is still a 20% discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is my final concession, so I expect you to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've made several concessions, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product. It's also a significant discount from your initial offer. Let's close this deal before time runs out.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,200,000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need you to meet me at $1,200,000. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for the full $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
