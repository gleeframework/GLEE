"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand that's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up a bit to $775,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to what I'd have to pay John anyway.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $775,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000, which is the price John is willing to pay. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",800000.0,Alice,7,
