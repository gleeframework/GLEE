"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500, considering the value of the product.  It's still a good deal for you, and we can close this quickly.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,800 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,100? That way we both get a fair deal, and we can finally close this transaction.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $8,100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting close to my bottom line, but I'm still not there yet. $7,900 is close, but I'd be happy to take $8,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly.",8000.0,Alice,7,
