"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can afford. Can you consider it?",140.0,Bob,4,
