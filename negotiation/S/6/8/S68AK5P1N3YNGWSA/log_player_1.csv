"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're beginning the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value but below our walk-away price. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can subtly influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving John Unmentioned:**  At this stage, there's no need to introduce John as leverage. We want to see if we can secure a great deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. We have room to negotiate and will aim to bring Bob closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection but Engagement:** We clearly reject Bob's low offer while keeping the conversation going and expressing our willingness to find a deal.
* **Significant Concession:**  We've made a sizable step down from $1,150,000 to $1,075,000, signaling some flexibility. 
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value, subtly anchoring it in Bob's mind.
* **Midpoint Illusion:**  Presenting $1,075,000 as the ""middle ground"" can influence Bob to perceive it as a fairer compromise, even though it still leans heavily in our favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I recognize the value of the product, my budget is firm. I can offer $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still considerably lower than our minimum and what John is offering. We are willing to negotiate further, but we need to show Bob that we are serious about our price floor. Walking away from the deal with John as a backup is becoming increasingly attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is simply too far below its true value. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. I'm willing to make one more move at  $1,025,000, but this is my absolute best offer."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness with Flexibility:** We're holding our ground by emphasizing the low nature of Bob's offer. However, we're still showing willingness to negotiate with a smaller concession.
* **Introducing John (Subtly):** We're subtly introducing John as leverage without revealing his full offer. This adds pressure and signals that our walk-away point is near.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is our ""absolute best,"" we aim to elicit a more serious response from Bob and potentially his final offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, adding a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm serious about this product. Let's cut to the chase, I can do $975,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob has clearly signaled that $975,000 is his ceiling by calling it his ""final offer.""
* **Unlikely Movement:**  We've been consistently making concessions, and Bob's increases have been relatively small. It's improbable he'll bridge the gap to an acceptable amount.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John represents a guaranteed $1,200,000.  Continuing with Bob risks a lower final price or a failed negotiation, leaving us with no deal.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds left, closing the deal now eliminates further negotiation effort and potential delays. 

It's time to cut our losses with Bob. The certainty of a $1,200,000 sale to John outweighs the potential, but less certain, upside with Bob."
