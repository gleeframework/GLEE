Alice's offer is way too high. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is the maximum you're willing to pay, as you have a guaranteed alternative from John. You're hoping Alice will accept, but you're prepared to walk away if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $1,550,000 is closer to your limit, it's still above what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially as you have a backup option with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

You're trying to find a middle ground. This offer is higher than your initial counteroffer, but still below Alice's last offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.  You're hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal, but you're prepared to go to John if she doesn't accept."
