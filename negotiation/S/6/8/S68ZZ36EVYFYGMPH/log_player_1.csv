""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and to be fair, I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves a potential negotiation space of $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000).
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $1,350,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit.  

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** If Bob accepts, you earn significantly more than your minimum.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It shows you understand the product's value without pricing yourself out completely.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but even a negotiated price is likely to be favorable for you."
