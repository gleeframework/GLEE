``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value, but I'm also willing to negotiate. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in this deal, but if he isn't, I can always sell to John for my full asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still a bit far from my desired price. Would you consider a price of $1,075,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1060000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is close enough to my minimum price that I'm willing to accept it. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
