"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,750? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to my target. Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,625? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.",11625.0,Bob,4,
