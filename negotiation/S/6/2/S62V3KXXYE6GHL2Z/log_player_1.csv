Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a good deal.

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  Opening with a high price leaves room for negotiation.
* **Show flexibility:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to counteroffer.
* **Secure a good deal:** If Bob accepts, it's a profitable sale. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating or sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target.
* **Next round:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to find a price that is both profitable for me and acceptable to him.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss compared to my minimum value. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  By continuing negotiations, I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired amount.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage during the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows willingness to compromise and potentially find a middle ground.
* **Message:**  I reiterate my understanding of Bob's budget and position the counteroffer as a fair compromise. I'm also highlighting the product's value to emphasize the potential benefit for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our initial offers.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By sticking to a price above my minimum, I retain leverage in the negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and encouraging tone, making Bob more likely to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:**  Bob's offer of $9,800 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Continuing negotiations would likely result in further concessions from me, leading to a loss. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profitable sale at my desired price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Negotiating further with Bob risks lowering the price and potentially missing out on a guaranteed profitable sale.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing negotiations takes time, which could be used to pursue other opportunities.
* **John is a reliable buyer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
