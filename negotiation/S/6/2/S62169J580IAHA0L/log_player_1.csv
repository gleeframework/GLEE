"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also framing it as a good deal for him to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I will reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,500 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point. I am still leaving some room for negotiation but not willing to go lower than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,200 is closer to my minimum price of $8,000, it's still below it. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,200 is still too low.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $7,800. This is my final offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7800}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's price point, but I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer.  This creates pressure on him to either accept or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle right in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,500 is close to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement with Bob before the 10 rounds are over.  It's better to sell to John and guarantee my minimum price of $8,000."
