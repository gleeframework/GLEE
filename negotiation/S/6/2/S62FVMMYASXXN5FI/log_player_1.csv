Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
