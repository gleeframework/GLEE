Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. My next offer is $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he'll continue negotiating to see if he can get an even lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not ready to accept $850000. My next offer is $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $800000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is still a decent price, it's getting closer to Bob's preferred price point.  It's also significantly lower than the $1,500,000 he'd pay from John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to acquire the product while still staying within his budget."
