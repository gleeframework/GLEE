"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and both Alice and John are offering the product at that price, there is no financial benefit to rejecting Alice's offer. You might as well accept it as it achieves your goal of acquiring the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay."
