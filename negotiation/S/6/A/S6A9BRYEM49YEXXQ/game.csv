"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,750? I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.",15750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15,750. I'm willing to take a slightly bigger step towards you and offer it to you for $16,250.",16250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,250 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's meet in the middle at $15,500. This is my final offer. ",15500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $15,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,7,
