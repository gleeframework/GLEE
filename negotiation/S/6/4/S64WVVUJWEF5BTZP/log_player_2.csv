"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $115 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium compared to its intrinsic value. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $120. Alice is offering the product for $115. While this is a better price than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice or potentially find another seller."
