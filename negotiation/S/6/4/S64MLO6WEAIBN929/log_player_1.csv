Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit. It leaves room for negotiation and still allows for a good margin for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone in the message can help build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** My minimum selling price is $80, and Bob's offer is at that minimum. While I could accept it, I'm not motivated to sell at the absolute minimum.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm still hoping to get a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my initial offer of $100. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** If I accept Bob's offer, I make no profit. By continuing the negotiation, I have the chance to improve my financial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a bit of a profit."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" aspect, suggesting that $90 is a good deal for both of us.
* **Profit Margin:**  $90 still allows me to make a profit while being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Profit:**  While $85 isn't ideal, it's still a small profit for me, which is better than selling to John for $80.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  By closing this deal with Bob, I might create an opportunity for future sales with him if he's satisfied with the product and the price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John for a lower price.  It's better to secure a small profit than risk ending up with nothing."
