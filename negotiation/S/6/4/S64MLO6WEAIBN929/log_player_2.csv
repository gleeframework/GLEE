Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a bit of a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

However, I'm not sure if I want to pay $90 when I know I can get the product from John for $120. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if she's willing to go lower.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she's already offered me $90, I'll try to get closer to my target price of $80. I'll offer $85, which is a bit lower than her previous offer.
