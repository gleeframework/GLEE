"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $115. Let's make this happen.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $125. It's still a great value for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",125.0,Alice,5,
