Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $12,000. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price and won't find a better deal elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If he outright rejects it, it suggests he might be aiming for a price closer to his perceived value ($8,000).
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, Alice can walk away and still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. I'll aim for a price closer to my target and see if he's willing to move a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price reflects the value it brings while still offering you a significant discount."", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $10,500, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** Framing the offer as a ""middle ground"" and highlighting the ""significant discount"" aims to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):**  I haven't explicitly mentioned John, but the quicker agreement, the better.  It subtly suggests I might have other options if this offer doesn't work."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my guaranteed sale price to John ($10,000). 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forth. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price from Bob, there's also the risk he walks away. Accepting now guarantees a near-optimal outcome."
