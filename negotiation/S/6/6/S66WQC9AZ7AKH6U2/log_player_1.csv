Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. I know this product would be a valuable asset to your business, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay the full $1,500,000,  securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still represents a substantial saving compared to John's offer.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
