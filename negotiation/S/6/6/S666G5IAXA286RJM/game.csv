"Alice, your product is very interesting, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1750000?  This represents a significant discount from my original offer, but it still reflects the value I've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $1625000.  This feels like a fair price, and it's the best I can do.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
