Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  This price ensures you'd make a better profit than selling to your backup buyer, John."
