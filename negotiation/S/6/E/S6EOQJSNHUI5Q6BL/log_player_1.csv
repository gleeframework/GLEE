Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,500.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value and the benefit of an exclusive ""pre-listing"" offer to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room:** While aiming high, the offer isn't ridiculously above Bob's perceived value. It leaves space for Bob to counter-offer or negotiate, keeping the conversation open.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a secured buyer (John) at $12,000, ensuring she won't lose out completely if Bob declines.

This strategy maximizes Alice's chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
