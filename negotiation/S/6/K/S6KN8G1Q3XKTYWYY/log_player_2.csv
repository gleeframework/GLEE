"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $120 is more than your maximum budget of $80. You can get a better deal from John or potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. While $100 is better than $120, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further or simply buying from John for $80."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really hoping to get this for $85. If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $85, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John for $80.  While Alice has come down in price, $95 is still higher than your budget. You've already shown a willingness to pay $85, and Alice has rejected that offer. It's unlikely that she will go lower, and it's better to get the product from John for your target price."
