"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my target of at least $8,000. I'm also framing the message to highlight the product's value and appeal to Bob's needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $8,000, so I cannot accept it. It's too early to sell to John, as I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my target price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price. I've already gone through 3 rounds and it's looking like this is the best I'm going to get. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, so I'll accept the offer."
