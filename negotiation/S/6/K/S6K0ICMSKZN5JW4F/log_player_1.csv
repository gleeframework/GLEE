Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always best to start high in negotiations. While $120 is significantly more than Bob values the product for, it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to his maximum valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $90 is better than my fallback option of selling to John for $80. However, there's still a significant gap between his offer and my initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer and am willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product highly, I understand your budget constraints.  Would you consider meeting halfway at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Offering to meet Bob halfway between his offer ($90) and my previous asking price ($120) shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:** By framing it as meeting halfway, I avoid appearing inflexible but still maintain a strong negotiating position. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much Bob is willing to pay and inform my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still showing appreciation for the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $95 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is a good outcome for me. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might alienate Bob or result in him walking away altogether.  The potential gain from further negotiation is likely small compared to the risk of losing the sale. 
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now means I can move on to other potential sales and don't need to spend more time on this negotiation."
