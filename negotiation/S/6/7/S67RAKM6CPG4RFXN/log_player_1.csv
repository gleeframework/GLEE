Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  Any deal depends on negotiation tactics and finding creative solutions.

**The Offer**

Since there's no guaranteed profit margin with Bob, you need to aim high and hope he's willing to stretch his budget. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other potential buyers.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given the potential returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of scarcity and urgency.
* **Confidence:**  By stating your confidence in the product's value, you subtly anchor the negotiation at a higher point.
* **High Price:**  While above Bob's valuation, it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can gauge his seriousness and adjust accordingly. 
* **Justification:** You provide a reason for the high price without explicitly revealing your bottom line.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob refuses to budge close to your minimum, you're better off selling to John.
* **Consider Alternatives:** If you want to explore all options, you could propose a payment plan or other creative solutions to bridge the gap between your valuations.

**Remember:** Negotiation is about finding mutually beneficial solutions. While your goal is to maximize profit, approaching the conversation with flexibility and understanding will increase the chances of a successful outcome, even if it means ultimately selling to John."
