"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a lower price point.  How about we start at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous numbers. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my end while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  How about we settle at $1,075,000 and close this deal out?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are close. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
