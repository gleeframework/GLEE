Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a lower price point.  How about we start at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous numbers. Would you consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a significant amount less than John's guaranteed offer.  I'll counter in the next round, trying to push closer to $1,100,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my end while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  How about we settle at $1,075,000 and close this deal out? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, we are still in a position to negotiate further. The difference between his offer and John's guaranteed purchase is significant enough to warrant at least one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are close. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:** By presenting this as my ""final offer"", I aim to create a sense of urgency. This, combined with a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, may encourage him to accept. If he rejects, we're getting close to the point where accepting John's offer is the more logical choice."
