Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are close. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price point that's not advantageous for you. While she's come down, $1,125,000 is still significantly more than your fallback option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  

At this point, the potential savings outweigh the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice."
