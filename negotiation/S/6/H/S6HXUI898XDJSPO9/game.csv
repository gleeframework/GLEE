"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,000,000 is below my initial target, I recognize the value you see in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me on the price. That said, $1,150,000 is still a little steep.  Could you do $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 for this to make sense for me.  How about we settle at $1,080,000?",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $1,080,000 is tempting, but I'm aiming for $1,060,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1060000.0,Bob,6,
