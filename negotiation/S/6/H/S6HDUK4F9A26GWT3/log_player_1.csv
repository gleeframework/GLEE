Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $14,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $13,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $11,500 is still a significant profit above my minimum. It's not worth the risk of losing Bob entirely for a potential gain of $500 or less."
