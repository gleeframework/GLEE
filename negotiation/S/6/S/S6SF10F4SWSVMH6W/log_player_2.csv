Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, as it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  Let's close this deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
