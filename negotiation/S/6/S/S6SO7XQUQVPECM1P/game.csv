"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,100,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $1,150,000? It's a compromise that I think still reflects the value of the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still hesitant to go that high.  Would you consider $1,075,000?  I feel this is a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we try $1,125,000? It's a compromise that I think still reflects the value of the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
