"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is still a fair price given its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 represents a fair starting point given the product's potential, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This offer still reflects the significant value this product holds.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is closer to what I believe is a fair price.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
