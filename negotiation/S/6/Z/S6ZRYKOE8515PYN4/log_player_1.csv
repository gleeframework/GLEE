Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, making him more likely to make a counteroffer instead of immediately rejecting. This allows for further negotiation.
* **Addressing the Value:** I acknowledge the product's value to me, showing I'm not being unreasonable.
* **Leaving the Option Open:**  I'm not pushing Bob to accept right away, making him feel less pressured and more willing to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000, and even below my initial offer of $9,500.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While John is a guaranteed $10,000, I can potentially increase my earnings by further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially drive the price higher. 

**Next Move:** I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer or closer to John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 for the product.  Let's meet halfway,  I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I'm using language like ""open to further discussion"" to keep the negotiation going and potentially move the price even higher.
* **Maintaining My Minimum:** $9,000 is still above my minimum value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, providing a secure and profitable sale.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Although John offers a sure thing, I can still potentially increase my earnings by continuing to negotiate with Bob. However, there's a risk that the negotiation could collapse, leaving me with no deal.

**Next Move:** I'll counteroffer Bob once more, aiming for a price closer to $9,000 or perhaps even higher. However, I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $9,250? This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs. I'm open to closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm positioning this as my last offer, signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm highlighting the compromise and fairness of the offer to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""closing the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the transaction.

**Thinking Ahead:**  This is a calculated risk. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000. However, I believe there's a good chance that Bob will accept this final offer, allowing me to earn more than I would from John."
