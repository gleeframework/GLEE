,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 for the product.  Let's meet halfway,  I'm open to further discussion.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $9,250? This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs. I'm open to closing the deal at this price.",9250.0,Alice,5,
