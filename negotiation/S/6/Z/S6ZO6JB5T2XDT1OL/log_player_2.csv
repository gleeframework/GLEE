"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. There are 9 more rounds, and Alice has already stated the product is worth $800,000 to her, so there's room to bargain."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's original price. This shows Bob is serious about negotiation and sets the stage for a potential compromise.
* **Reasoning:** Bob gives a reason for his offer, showing he's not just throwing out a random number. He mentions the product's value to him, indicating he's researched the market.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Bob ends with a question, inviting Alice to respond and potentially start a dialogue."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Round 7

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to reaching your target, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $865,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go up to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'll only go up to $890,000. This is the highest I'm willing to compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  This is the 9th round, and Bob only has one round left to negotiate. 
* **Alice's offer is not ideal:** Alice's offer of $890,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price. 
* **John is a backup:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, which is only slightly more than Alice's current offer. Given the time constraint, it's not worth risking a final counteroffer that might be rejected, leading to a failed deal.

Bob is better off buying from John to ensure he gets the product at a reasonable price, even if it's not the absolute lowest."
