{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find it cheaper anywhere else."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100, especially since I can always sell to John for that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about $105? It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $97.50 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $97.50 is a fair compromise. Accepting his offer means a quicker sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
