"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the price I was originally looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1300000, which is the midpoint of my original offer and your latest counteroffer. This is my final offer, Bob. Let me know if you're willing to meet me here.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to draw a line in the sand.

"I've already made a very significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1300000. I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, and I need to consider other options. I'm willing to make one last attempt to negotiate, but I need to see a serious commitment from you. I'm counteroffering at $1300000, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other buyers. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,11,
