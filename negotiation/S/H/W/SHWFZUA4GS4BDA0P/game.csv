"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done my research and I know the product's value is higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but that's still a bit higher than I can afford right now. Let's try $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and allows you to make a profit while remaining within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise on $15,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows you to get a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
