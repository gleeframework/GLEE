"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $18,000.  
* **Counteroffer is the best option:** You should reject the offer and make a counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done my research and I know the product's value is higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's a compromise, $16,000 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Counteroffer is still the best option:** You should continue negotiating. You can either make a counteroffer closer to your budget or see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but that's still a bit higher than I can afford right now. Let's try $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and allows you to make a profit while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise on $15,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows you to get a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $15,500 is above your maximum budget of $12,000.  
* **Buying from John is the best option:**  While you might be able to continue negotiating with Alice, it's getting risky. You've already had several rounds, and Alice may not be willing to go lower. John is offering a guaranteed price within your budget, so it's the safest and most sensible choice."
