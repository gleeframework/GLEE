"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm countering with $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I hope this shows flexibility while still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better price. I'm also concerned that if I accept this offer, Bob may have been willing to pay more if I had been more persistent. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm countering again with $15,000.  We're getting closer to an agreement.  I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, hoping this will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum, I'm running out of time. I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob might get frustrated and walk away completely, and I'd be forced to sell to John for $12,000. It's better to secure the sale now and get $13,000."
