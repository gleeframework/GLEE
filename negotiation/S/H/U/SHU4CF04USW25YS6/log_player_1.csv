{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can adjust the price down slightly to find a mutually agreeable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum of $150. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $125? That's the lowest I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $125 is a higher price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already negotiated with Bob, and it seems like he's unwilling to go higher.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
