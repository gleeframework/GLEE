"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $700,000 is a good offer, I can likely get more. I'll try to counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still represents a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. Would you be open to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
