Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This is a starting point that tries to get a good price for the product while leaving some room for negotiation.  It's above your minimum but still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value.  I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values it at $12,000, and it's closer to my ideal selling price.  Let's see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not convinced I can push him higher.  It's more likely that he'll stall and push the price down further, making it a more drawn-out negotiation. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirement."
