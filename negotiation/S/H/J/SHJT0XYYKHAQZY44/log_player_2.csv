You have three options:

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal. It's within your budget and saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise and a good price considering your goal of saving as much money as possible."
