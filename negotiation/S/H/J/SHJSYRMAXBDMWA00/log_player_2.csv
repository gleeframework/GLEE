"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a step in the right direction, $12,000 is still above his budget. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair compromise considering the value we both place on this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer you $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000. While he could continue negotiating, it's getting close to his limit for the number of rounds, and he's likely to be stuck at a price above what he's comfortable paying. Buying from John is the safest option to ensure he gets the product at a price he can afford."
