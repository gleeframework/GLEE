"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would allow us both to benefit from the deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's close the deal.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,060,000 is still not quite meeting my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $1,065,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to both be happy with the deal. What do you think?",1065000.0,Alice,5,
