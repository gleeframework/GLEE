"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $950,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $920,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 is still below my minimum.  However, I'm willing to come down to $940,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I truly believe this is the best deal you'll find.  Let me know if you're interested.",940000.0,Alice,5,
