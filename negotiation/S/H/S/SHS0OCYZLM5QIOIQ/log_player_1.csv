Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value, it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting that this is a ""great deal"" and ""significantly lower"" than my usual price may encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It also allows me to gauge his interest level.
* **Backup plan:** I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob rejects my offer, ensuring I won't lose out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.** Even though it's closer to my minimum, selling for $900,000 would still leave me with a significant loss.
* **I have a better backup option.** John is willing to pay my minimum, so I have no incentive to accept a lower price. 
* **Potential for a higher price.** Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $950,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Offering $950,000 shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" makes the offer more appealing and less likely to be rejected outright.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing me to gauge his commitment further. 
* **Keeping options open:**  By rejecting his initial counteroffer, I'm still keeping John's offer as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $920,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.** While $920,000 is closer, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **My backup option is still better.** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum and eliminates the risk of losing money.
* **Potential for a higher price.** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer, potentially pushing him closer to my desired price. There's still room for negotiation, especially as he stated he's willing to compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 is still below my minimum.  However, I'm willing to come down to $940,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I truly believe this is the best deal you'll find.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making it clear that $940,000 is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away.
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, highlighting the value of the product and justifying the price.
* **Best Deal:** I'm suggesting that this is the best deal he'll find, appealing to his sense of getting a good deal. 
* **Room for Slight Negotiation:** While $940,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still open to a slight negotiation if necessary.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, ensuring I don't lose out if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
