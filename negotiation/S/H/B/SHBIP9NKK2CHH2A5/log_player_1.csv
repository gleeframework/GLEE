Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  I know this is a significant purchase, so please feel free to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your initial target. 
* **Justification:** While you know Bob's valuation is lower, you don't want to completely alienate him. By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly hint at its worth without directly revealing your minimum.
* **Politeness and Openness:**  A polite and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. You want to create a positive atmosphere, even if he decides to counter your initial offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects this price, you can gradually decrease it, gauging his reactions and responses. Remember, your absolute floor is $15,000 since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at that price."
