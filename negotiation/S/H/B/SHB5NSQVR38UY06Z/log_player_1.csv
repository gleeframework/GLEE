Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always accept his counteroffer if it's acceptable, or make a new counteroffer. I also have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $120.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. If Bob rejects, I can always accept his counteroffer if it's acceptable, or make a new counteroffer. I also have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is less than I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum price of $120.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of losing out on the sale altogether."
