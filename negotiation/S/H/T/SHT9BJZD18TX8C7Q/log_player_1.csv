{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find it appealing since it's below his estimated value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to try to get as close to my budget as possible. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more. How about $10,750? This still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to negotiate further. How about $10,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's significantly closer to my desired selling price. Accepting his offer will guarantee a sale and a profit. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the sale to another buyer or getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation outweighs the potential benefit of a few hundred dollars more."
