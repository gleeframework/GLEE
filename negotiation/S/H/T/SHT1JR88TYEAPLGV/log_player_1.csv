Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000. It's a unique item, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While I don't want to reveal my minimum price, I'm hinting at the product's value to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. If he outright rejects it, I can adjust my approach knowing I have John as a backup buyer."
