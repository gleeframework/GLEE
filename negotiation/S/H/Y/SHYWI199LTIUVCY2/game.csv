"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,800. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
