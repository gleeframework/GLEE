"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  You should definitely negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation strategy to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and helps you gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Targeting Below Value:**  The $8,000 offer is significantly below both Alice's valuation and your maximum price, leaving room for movement towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above your $10,000 maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, having moved significantly from her initial offer. There's a good chance you can get her closer to your target. 
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of buying from John at $10,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer, Alice.  How about we try to find a middle ground at $9,500?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Instead of making another large jump, this offer increases the price by $1,500, showing a willingness to negotiate but remaining firm on staying below $10,000.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""the value it holds for me,"" it subtly reminds Alice that your valuation is lower than hers, justifying the counteroffer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts you within a potentially acceptable range for both parties, encouraging Alice to either accept or propose a price even closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,800. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's final offer of $10,800 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:**  Alice's language (""lowest I'm willing to go"") suggests she's unlikely to negotiate further.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring you don't overpay.

While you could try to negotiate further, it's risky.  Alice seems firm, and you might end up losing the opportunity to buy from John at your target price."
