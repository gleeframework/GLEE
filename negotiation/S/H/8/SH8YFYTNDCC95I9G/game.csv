"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to consider $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $175?  That way we both get a fair price.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $150? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
