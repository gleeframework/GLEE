Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

While $1,600,000 is better than $1,200,000, it's still below the desired profit margin. It's worth exploring the negotiation further to see if we can push for a higher price."
