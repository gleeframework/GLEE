"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is far too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product represents a significant investment, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate you coming down, $1,400,000 is still too high.  How about $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation is around the price. Let's consider the long-term value this product brings.  To demonstrate my commitment to making this work, I propose $1,100,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her price reductions are still too incremental. Her ""final offer"" of $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than your $800,000 walk-away point and John's guaranteed price.  

It's unlikely Alice will come down to a price you'd find acceptable within the remaining rounds. Cutting your losses and buying from John ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
