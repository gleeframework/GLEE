"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is far too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents a significant investment, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate you coming down, $1,400,000 is still too high.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation is around the price. Let's consider the long-term value this product brings.  To demonstrate my commitment to making this work, I propose $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
