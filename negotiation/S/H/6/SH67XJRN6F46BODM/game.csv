"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but not at that price.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $15,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and is fair for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we try something around $9,500?  I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is too low. How about we settle at $13,000? This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Since you said that's your final offer, I'm going to have to consider my other options if you can't do $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,6,
