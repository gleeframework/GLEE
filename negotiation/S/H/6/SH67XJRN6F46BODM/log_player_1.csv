"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but not at that price.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $15,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we try something around $9,500?  I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is too low. How about we settle at $13,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Since you said that's your final offer, I'm going to have to consider my other options if you can't do $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to budge past $10,000. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Accepting his $10,000 offer is a $2,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed $12,000. It makes more financial sense to cut our losses and sell to John."
