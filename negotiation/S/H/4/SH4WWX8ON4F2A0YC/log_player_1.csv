Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its significant value proposition. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, while still ensuring a significant profit above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $925,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It demonstrates a willingness to make a deal while still aiming high.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup at $800,000 gives you leverage.  You're not desperate to sell at any cost. 

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy.  Depending on your negotiation style and knowledge about Bob, you might choose a different opening price."
