Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think?,180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $180 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $150?  That's my absolute maximum.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I sell it to you for $165? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $157.50.  What do you think?",157.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $157.50 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. How about I sell it to you for $160? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",160.0,Alice,5,
