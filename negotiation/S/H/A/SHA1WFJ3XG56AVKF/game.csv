"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
