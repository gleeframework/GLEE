"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120. Alice's offer of $110 is too high.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice values the product at $100, there is room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point, offering a fair compromise and potentially leading to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is now within your budget of $120, and it's closer to your ideal price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that is still favorable for you."
