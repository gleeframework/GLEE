"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $950,000?  That's a significant savings for you, and it puts me closer to my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate the best price, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
