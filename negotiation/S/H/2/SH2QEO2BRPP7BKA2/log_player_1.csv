Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. I am willing to stick to that amount if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Bob is holding firm at $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee further negotiation will result in a better offer from him, and I risk losing John's guaranteed $8,000. It's time to move on."
