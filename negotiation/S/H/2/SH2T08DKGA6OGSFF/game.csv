"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I still believe $850000 is a bit high, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000.  This is still within my budget and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is still a bit higher than your initial offer, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $800000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
