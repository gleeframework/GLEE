"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13250? It's a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $13,250 is closer to his target, he can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down to $13100, just $100 more than your offer. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still $1,100 more than what John is offering.  There's a risk that Alice will continue to counteroffer, potentially exceeding Bob's budget. To avoid that risk, it's better for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John at $12,000."
