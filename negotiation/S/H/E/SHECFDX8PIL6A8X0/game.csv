,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13250? It's a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a great deal for you.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down to $13100, just $100 more than your offer. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",13100.0,Alice,5,
