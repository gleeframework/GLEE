Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but $760,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $810,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to go below $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at that price. It makes more sense to take the sure deal and avoid further negotiation."
