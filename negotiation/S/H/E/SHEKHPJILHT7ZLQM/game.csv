"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you be open to $760,000? I feel this is a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but $760,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $810,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price.",810000.0,Alice,5,
