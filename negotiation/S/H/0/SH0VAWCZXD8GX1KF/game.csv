"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500, which is closer to my minimum requirement. I believe it's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
