Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150.  I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows me to potentially gain more than selling immediately to John for $100.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer of $150, it opens the door for negotiation. He may counter with a price closer to his value of $100.
* **Guaranteed Backup:** I'm not risking a loss by offering a high price initially because I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 if Bob rejects the offer."
