Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is still below Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will get, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I've made it clear I'm open to discussion, inviting a counteroffer if necessary.
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $12,000, setting a floor for my acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $12,500 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob clearly wants the product and has shown willingness to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffer:** I can counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price in the next round, aiming for a deal closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you. How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise that allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500.
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on the ""fair compromise"" and ""good deal"" aspects to encourage acceptance.
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Still above my minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I was thinking $13,000 would be a more comfortable price for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is just $500 below my initial offer of $13,500, which is a small difference.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:** If I reject, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer of $12,000. 
* **Minimizing potential losses:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is still good for me, especially considering the risk of further negotiation.

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice at this point. It minimizes the risk of losing the sale completely and secures a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
