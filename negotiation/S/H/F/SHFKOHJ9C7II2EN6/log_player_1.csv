{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob thinks the product is worth $100, so offering $125 gives him a bit of a discount and increases the likelihood he'll accept.
* **It's below your minimum:** This offer is still higher than your minimum of $150, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  You're not asking for the full $150 upfront, which might make Bob immediately reject the offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That product looks great, but $125 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $100. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
