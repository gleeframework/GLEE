"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think?

This is a very high offer. Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer.  While $11,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can still potentially do better.  He should counteroffer again to see if he can get closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
