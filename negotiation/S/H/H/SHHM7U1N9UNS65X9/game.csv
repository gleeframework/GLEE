"Thanks for offering, Alice!  That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $120 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget.  How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
