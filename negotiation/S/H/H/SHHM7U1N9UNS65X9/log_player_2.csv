Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $107.50, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which meets my needs and saves me money."
