"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both what the product is worth to me ($120) and what it's worth to her ($80). There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her perceived value of the product. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is polite and expresses interest while still clearly stating my position. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My goal is to acquire the product for a price significantly lower than $120. By starting low, I'm aiming to guide the negotiation in that direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $70 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Negotiating:** While $90 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my target price.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so I'll continue the process.
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $120. This gives me leverage to walk away if the negotiation doesn't move in a favorable direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $80?  That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Her Value:**  I'm now countering with a price that matches Alice's perceived value of the product. This is a strong negotiating tactic, as it offers her a fair profit while still saving me money.
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm being clear and direct about my desired price.  
* **Time Consideration:**  We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. I want to see if Alice is willing to accept a price that's good for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for this product. How about we try $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $85 is a reasonable price, significantly lower than my maximum of $120 and John's offer. 
* **Time Value:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Continuing to haggle over a few dollars might not be worth the risk of the deal falling through.
* **Alice's Signals:** Alice's message suggests she's getting close to her limit and is eager to make a deal.  

By accepting now, I secure a good price and avoid potentially pushing Alice away."
