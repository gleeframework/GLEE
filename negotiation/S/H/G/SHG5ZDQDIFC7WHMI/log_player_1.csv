Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it brings.

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,400,000. This price is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's continue our conversation from this point."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer to a deal. I've already lowered my price significantly, and your offer is still well below what I need to accept.

If you're genuinely interested in this deal, we need to find a middle ground. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where it's clear Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations. While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob,  his offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. To ensure I get a fair price for the product, I'm going to sell it to John."
