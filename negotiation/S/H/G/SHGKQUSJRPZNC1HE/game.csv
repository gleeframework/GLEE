"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $9,500 at the moment. I'm willing to pay up to $8,500 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $9,000 might be a bit high for my budget. I am willing to pay up to $8,750 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $8,750.  Would you consider $8,875?  That's my final offer.",8875.0,Alice,5,
