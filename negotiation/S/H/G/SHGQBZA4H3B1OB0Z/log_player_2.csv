# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I could consider a price closer to $11,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is a reasonable price that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe you'll find it more acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but $13,500 is still a touch high. How about we settle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems quite firm on her price and is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000. While we could continue negotiating, we risk the possibility of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or us running out of rounds.  At this point, cutting our losses and securing the product from John at $10,000 is the most financially sound decision."
