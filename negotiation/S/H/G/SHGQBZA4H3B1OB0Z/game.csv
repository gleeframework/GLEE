"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I could consider a price closer to $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe you'll find it reasonable.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is a reasonable price that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe you'll find it more acceptable.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but $13,500 is still a touch high. How about we settle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",13000.0,Alice,7,
