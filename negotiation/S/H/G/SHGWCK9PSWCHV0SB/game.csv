"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price that's well below market value, and I get a sale that's still very beneficial to me.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would allow me to make the purchase and still stay within my financial limits. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to go that low at this time. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows me to make the purchase comfortably. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works a little better for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price for a product of this quality, and allows me to make a sale.  Let's work together to get this deal finalized.",925000.0,Alice,5,
