"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price that's well below market value, and I get a sale that's still very beneficial to me.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below market value, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to go that low at this time. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob should continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works a little better for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price for a product of this quality, and allows me to make a sale.  Let's work together to get this deal finalized. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $925,000, this is still above Bob's budget and getting closer to his maximum.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might not budge further, and Bob might end up paying more than he wants to.  It's time to secure a good deal, and buying from John at $800,000 guarantees that Bob stays within his budget."
