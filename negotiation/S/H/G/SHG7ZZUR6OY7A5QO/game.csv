"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I believe I can't justify spending $18,000 on it. I would like to propose a price of $12,000. I hope this is within your acceptable range.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's a significant reduction from my original price, and I believe it's still a fair offer considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $16,000 is still quite high for the product. I would like to propose a price of $14,000. I hope this is closer to what you're willing to accept.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $14,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with a price of $14,000. I hope this meets your expectations while staying within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,6,
