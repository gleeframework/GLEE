Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I will be moving forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A slightly lower starting point ($925,000) leaves space for Bob to negotiate up, potentially landing closer to his maximum.
* **Deadline for Urgency:**  A deadline encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from endlessly delaying a decision.
* **Backup Option:** The message subtly reminds Bob that you have other options (John), increasing your leverage.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic approach, increasing the likelihood of securing a high sale price from Bob while retaining the safety net of John's offer."
