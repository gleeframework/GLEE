"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but also shows my willingness to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000. Given that John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000, I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while keeping me within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
