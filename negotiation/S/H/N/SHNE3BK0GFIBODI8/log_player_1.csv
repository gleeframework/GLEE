Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than my asking price.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High But Justifiable:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.  
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a secure offer from John at $800,000, so she's not desperate and can afford to aim high."
