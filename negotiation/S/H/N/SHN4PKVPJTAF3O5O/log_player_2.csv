"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to you than that.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's not the absolute best deal.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal and save money. He's starting with a lower offer, $12,500, which is still above Alice's minimum of $12,000. This gives Alice a chance to counter, but also shows Bob is serious about getting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $13,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $12,500 to $13,000, showing he's willing to compromise. This is a reasonable counteroffer, giving Alice a good price while still saving Bob money compared to John's price."
