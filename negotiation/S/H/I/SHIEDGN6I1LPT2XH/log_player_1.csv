Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $160. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** A higher initial offer helps you understand Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you know he's likely price-sensitive.
* **Backup Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer. This allows you to be more firm in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** While you have a backup buyer, be prepared to potentially lower your price slightly if Bob shows interest but hesitates at $160.  You want to maximize profit, but being too rigid might lead to losing the sale altogether."
