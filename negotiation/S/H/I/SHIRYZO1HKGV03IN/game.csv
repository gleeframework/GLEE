,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $11500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the continued negotiations.  $11500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference at $12000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to close the deal.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $11800. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider it?",11800.0,Bob,6,
