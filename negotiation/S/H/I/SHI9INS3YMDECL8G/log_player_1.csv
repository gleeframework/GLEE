Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it very valuable. How does $150 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, and Bob might accept your initial offer.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his interest level. If he flat out rejects it, we know he's price sensitive. If he counters, we can negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows us to be more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob."
