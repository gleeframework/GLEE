"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll try to meet him in the middle in the next round, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $135 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $127? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $130.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $127 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130 to make this work.  It's the best I can do, and it's still a great price for this product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm feeling the pressure with only a few rounds left.  While I'd prefer to get $130, Bob's offer of $128 is only $2 below my minimum and a significant increase from his previous offers.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
