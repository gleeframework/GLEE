"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. It makes sense to negotiate further and try to get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000), I am aiming to understand Alice's flexibility and create room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Respectful:** The message maintains a polite and respectful tone to foster a positive negotiation environment.  
* **Expressing Interest:**  Clearly stating my interest in the product encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my ideal price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially missing out on this offer.  It's better to secure the product at the desired price than to risk further negotiation."
