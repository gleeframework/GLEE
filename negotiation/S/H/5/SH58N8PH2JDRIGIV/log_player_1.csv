Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to see it as a gain if he values its unique aspects.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Negotiation dynamics and Bob's responses might lead to adjustments in subsequent offers."
