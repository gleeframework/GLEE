"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. Would that work for you?",14000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $11,500? I think that's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,13000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit higher than your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. Would that be something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation.  $13,000 is still a tough pill for me to swallow. I'd be willing to go up to $12,000, and I think that's really pushing my limit.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,6,,
