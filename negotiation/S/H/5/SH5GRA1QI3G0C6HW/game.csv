"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay up to $8,500, but I'd rather not go higher than that.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $9,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
