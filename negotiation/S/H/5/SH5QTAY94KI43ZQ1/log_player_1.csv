Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **Bob:** Gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him ($1,000,000).
    * **Alice:** Earns an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John. 

By starting with a strong offer, you increase the chances of Bob accepting and you maximizing your profit."
