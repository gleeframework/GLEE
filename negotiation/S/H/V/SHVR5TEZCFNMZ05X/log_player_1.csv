{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum ($8,000), but I'm also aware that Bob has a clear value for the product. I'll be ready to negotiate if needed, but I can also walk away and sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a compromise that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for a product worth $8,000 to you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and do $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and a good compromise.  It's more than what John would pay, so I'm happy to accept and finalize the deal."
