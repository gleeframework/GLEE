Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing me to earn a significant profit. I'll be watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's a price Bob is willing to pay. I'm keeping the price closer to my initial offer, hoping to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'm hoping to push him a little higher, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option if this negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $160.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get Bob to agree, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150. Since John is willing to buy it for that price, I'm going to sell it to him.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's important to be realistic about potential buyers."
