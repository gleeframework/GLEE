"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $11,500.  Would you be willing to meet at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about $11,750?  This is my final offer.",11750.0,Bob,6,
