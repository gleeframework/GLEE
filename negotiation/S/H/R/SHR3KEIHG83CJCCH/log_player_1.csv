{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I believe $11,200 represents a fair compromise. It bridges the gap between our valuations and ensures a win-win scenario for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product holds significant value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob has moved closer to my initial offer and this price is a good compromise, netting a decent profit above my minimum. It's not worth risking John changing his mind or Bob lowering his offer further."
