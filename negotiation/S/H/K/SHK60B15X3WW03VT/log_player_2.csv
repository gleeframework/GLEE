"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to try and make this work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if a price closer to his budget can be reached.  There's still potential to get a better deal by counter-offering."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $10,750 is still a little too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. I believe it's a good price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this and close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate may lead to a slightly lower price, but there's no guarantee.  Given the option to buy from John for $10,000, it's the most financially advantageous choice for Bob to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at his desired price point."
