Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm trying to be reasonable and present a price that still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in the conversation to assess his willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while also potentially securing a price closer to my minimum value.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and the risk of going to John as an alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you placed on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $10,500 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **John as a backup:**  While I'm willing to explore a counteroffer with Bob, I have a guaranteed sale with John at a price I'm happy with. This gives me leverage in negotiations. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to walk away if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to try and make this work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and focused on finding a solution.

This approach aims to show Bob that I'm serious about selling to him while still protecting my financial interests.  I'm hopeful that this compromise will encourage Bob to accept, but I'll remain prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Close to John's offer:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, I'm only $250 away from selling to John for $12,000. 
* **Risk of further concessions:** Accepting this offer might lead to further concessions from Bob, ultimately resulting in a price I'm not comfortable with.

I believe it's better to hold firm and make one more counteroffer to see if Bob will meet me closer to my target price. If not, I'll happily take John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $10,750 is still a little too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. I believe it's a good price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this and close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer represents a final compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous counteroffer. 
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement and urging Bob to finalize the deal.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

This approach aims to push Bob towards a price closer to my target while still showing flexibility. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll confidently go with John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
