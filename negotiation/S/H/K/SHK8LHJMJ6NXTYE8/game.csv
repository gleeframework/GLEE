"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great value for what it can do, and I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
