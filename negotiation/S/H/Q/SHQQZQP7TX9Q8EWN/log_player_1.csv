Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and selling to John for the same price is a waste of time."
