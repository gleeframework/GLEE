Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is a significant move, showing Bob that I am serious about closing a deal with him.  However, it's still a substantial profit for me, and above John's offer. This should encourage Bob to come closer to my price point."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to budge further."

Round 7

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,375,000. This is a small compromise, showing Bob that I'm flexible but still firm on getting a good price.  It's a good middle ground between our current offers and could lead to a successful agreement."

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not confident that I can get a better deal with Bob within the remaining rounds.
