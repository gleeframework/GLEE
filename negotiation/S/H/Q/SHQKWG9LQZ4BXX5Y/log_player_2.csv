{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and it's still a good deal for Alice since it's higher than the value she puts on the product. Hopefully, she'll accept it, but if not, we can continue negotiating."
