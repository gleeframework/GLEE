"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product for both of us. I believe this is a win-win situation. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making an offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, however. Let's compromise at $1,150,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product while offering a reasonable discount.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. It's very close, but I can't go any lower than $1,175,000. This price still offers you a discount while ensuring I get a fair return on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. Let's close this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
