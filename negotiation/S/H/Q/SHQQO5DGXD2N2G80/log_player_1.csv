Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 (our minimum), we can afford to start significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to capture more of the product's value for Alice.
* **Strategic Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price in Bob's mind.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with ""What are your thoughts?"" signaling a willingness to hear Bob's perspective and potentially negotiate. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
