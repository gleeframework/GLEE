"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or go with John as a last resort."
