Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price slightly lower but still very profitable for Alice.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed $10,000 from John. Offering the product to Bob at $11,500 first gives her a chance to secure the higher profit margin."
