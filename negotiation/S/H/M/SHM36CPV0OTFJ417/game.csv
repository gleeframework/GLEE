"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. However, I'm open to some negotiation, so I'll make a compromise at $950,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we split the difference at $900,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target, so I'll make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",920000.0,Alice,5,
