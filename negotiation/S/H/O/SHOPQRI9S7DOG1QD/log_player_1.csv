"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $80 to me. I'm hoping Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price,  $92 is a good compromise and I'm not sure if we will be able to close a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $80 if I don't get a better price."
