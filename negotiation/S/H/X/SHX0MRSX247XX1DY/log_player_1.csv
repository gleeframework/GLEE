"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially given Bob's initial rejection of my offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
