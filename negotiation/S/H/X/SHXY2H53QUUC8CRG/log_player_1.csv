"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still leaving room for negotiation.  Bob might reject it, but it's a good starting point to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't sell for significantly less than what I value the product at."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'm not yet at a point where I'm comfortable selling to John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to drop the price again, but this time by a smaller margin. I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum.  I believe that Bob may be more willing to accept this offer, as it's now just $50,000 above his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiations to see if I can get him to go higher.  There's a chance he'll simply walk away, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm making a significant concession this time, dropping the price by $100,000. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more, as we are now only $50,000 apart.  I'm also getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob refusing to budge much further, I'm going to sell to John.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's more important to secure a sale and I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer."
