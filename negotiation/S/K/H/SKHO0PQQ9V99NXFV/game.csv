"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,
