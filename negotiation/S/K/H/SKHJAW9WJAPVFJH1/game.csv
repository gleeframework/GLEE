"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like. How about we settle at $11,750? This feels like a fair compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about we settle at $11,500?  I think this is a good compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
