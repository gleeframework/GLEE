"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $135. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if you're interested!",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I'm willing to make one more compromise - I can throw in a small bonus worth $5, which will bring the total price to $140. It's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested!",140.0,Alice,5,
