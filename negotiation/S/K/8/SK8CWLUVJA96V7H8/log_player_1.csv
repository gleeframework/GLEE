**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, and it seems unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to my $1,000,000 valuation. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially settling for a lower price."
