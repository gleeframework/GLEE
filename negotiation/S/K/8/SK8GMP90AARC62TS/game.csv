"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000? I believe this would still provide a significant value for the product while staying within my financial limits.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to reach a more reasonable price point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000 for the product. This still offers substantial value while aligning more closely with my budgetary constraints. I hope we can find common ground.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,225,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit too far apart.  I'm willing to go down to $1,235,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1235000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I understand your offer of $1,235,000 is a compromise, but it still exceeds my budget by a significant margin. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,220,000. This price still represents a good value for the product and brings us closer to my financial limits. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
