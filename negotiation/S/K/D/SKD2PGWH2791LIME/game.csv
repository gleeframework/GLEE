"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant intrinsic value and potential for growth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet closer to the middle. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product. Can we compromise on this amount?",950000.0,Bob,4,
