"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be highly valuable to you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it's a price that I believe is fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
