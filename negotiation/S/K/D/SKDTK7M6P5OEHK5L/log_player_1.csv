Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum value ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I'll use John as a safety net if the price drops too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value ($15,000), it's still significantly below what I'd ideally like to get.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to risk another round of counter-offers to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000 to make this work for me. Let's find a price that's fair for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:** I'm narrowing the gap by offering a price closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm using language that invites Bob to continue the conversation and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not giving in to his initial offer, reminding him that I have other options (John) if we can't reach a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000 and is above my desired price of $11,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, or I might end up accepting a lower price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Safety Net:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if I'm unhappy with the final deal. 

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer at $10,500 seems like the most logical and practical decision at this point."
