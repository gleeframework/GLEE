"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I'm confident you'll appreciate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is significantly higher than Alice's perceived value of $800,000. This indicates there's room for negotiation. 
* **You have a higher limit:** You're willing to spend up to $1,500,000, so you can afford to negotiate further.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $750,000. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target:**  $850,000 is still a bit higher than where you want to be. You're trying to get the price down to $750,000 or lower.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While Alice moved closer to your initial counteroffer, there's likely room for more give and take. 
* **Avoiding unnecessary expense:** Buying from John for $1,500,000 would be a significantly worse deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
