Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of value. I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price before selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. It's still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to pay a fair amount. How about $10000? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer of $10,000 matches John's offer.  Since I'm guaranteed $10,000 from John, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
