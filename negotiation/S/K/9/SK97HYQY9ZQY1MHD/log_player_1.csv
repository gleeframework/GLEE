Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. Aiming higher with Bob initially allows you to potentially earn a much larger profit.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting at $15,000 gives you room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Value Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at its high value, potentially justifying the price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could try different approaches, like a more aggressive opening price or a softer approach that emphasizes the product's value to Bob."
