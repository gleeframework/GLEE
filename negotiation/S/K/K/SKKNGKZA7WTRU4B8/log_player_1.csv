Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is more than my minimum value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm also trying to be friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $100.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate the offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $80 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm proposing $90 as a counteroffer. It's a compromise between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. How about we try $85? It's a good middle ground for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $85 is a good compromise and is significantly better than selling to John for $80. It's worth taking the deal to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potential delays."
