Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll be ready to adjust if needed, but I want to see if I can get a good price up front."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $130. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's low initial offer.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm going to counter with another offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110.  This is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping it will be attractive enough to convince Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I might start considering selling to John."
