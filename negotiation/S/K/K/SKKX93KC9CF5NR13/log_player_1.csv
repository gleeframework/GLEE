Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""Given its value..."") to justify the higher price, without explicitly revealing your minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), suggesting a willingness to discuss the price and potentially negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
