"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a great price considering what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still being within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
