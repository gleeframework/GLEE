Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Open to negotiation:** By saying I'm ""open to negotiation,"" I signal that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Direct approach:**  I'm clear about my asking price, and I'm inviting Bob to respond.

**Next steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.  I'll also keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $8000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and it's possible Bob might change his mind or decide to walk away.  Selling to John for the same price offers no additional benefit."
