Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get more for the product. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $120, it's better to secure a sale now at $115 than risk losing the deal altogether or selling to John for $100."
