"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I'm able to spend. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $20,000 represents a fair price given the product's value, I'd like to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $17,500? ",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $16,250. This would allow me to buy the product while staying within my budget, and it's a fair price considering your asking price.",16250.0,Bob,4,
