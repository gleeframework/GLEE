"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $7,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",7750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding.  $7,750 is close, but I could buy it from another seller right now for $8,000.  To make it worth my while, I need a price that beats that.  Would you be willing to go down to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
