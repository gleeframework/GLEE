"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $120 for it.  This is my best offer.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $155, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll meet you at $140. That's as low as I can go.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still sticking to my offer of $120.  This is my absolute limit.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already compromised a lot, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $140, and I've already offered you that price. I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's it. I'll sell it to you for $145. That's as low as I can go.",145.0,Alice,7,
