Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already compromised a lot, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $140, and I've already offered you that price.

Alice is still too high at $145. I'm getting frustrated with the negotiation, and even though there are more rounds, I'm not sure I can get her down to my target price.  I'm going to buy from John instead."
