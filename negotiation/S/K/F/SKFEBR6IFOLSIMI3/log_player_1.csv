Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product here that I believe will be of great value to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,500,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price, but let's start the conversation here.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the information I have now, I'm willing to offer $1000000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for a higher price. Bob's rejection signals he's interested but not at that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000 to see if we can strike a deal. This price reflects the significant value this product offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
