Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $80 and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, making the offer more attractive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message shows I'm open to negotiating, which could encourage Bob to accept or counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and my options:

* **Accepting:** If his counteroffer is close to my desired price, I might accept.
* **Counteroffering:**  If his offer is too low, I'll counter with a price closer to $120.
* **Selling to John:** If negotiations stall or his offers become unreasonable, I'll switch to John to secure the minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below my Minimum:**  While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $120 by counteroffering.
* **Negotiation is Key:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his current offer.  I'll aim for a price around $110, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm counteroffering with $110, which is halfway between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Fair Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, which could encourage him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll consider a new counteroffer, keeping in mind the need to get closer to my minimum value while still appealing to Bob. If his counteroffers keep falling below my minimum value, I'll switch to selling the product to John to secure at least my minimum earnings."
