{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still lower than the product's value to Bob. This strategy gives me room to negotiate further while also incentivizing Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that's a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly below the product's value to me and what I initially offered.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's try $950,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price point and represents a good deal considering his initial offer of $850,000. While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer from Bob or him walking away entirely is too high.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale that is closer to my goal, and I'm confident that I've secured a good deal."
