"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you consider $725,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while recognizing the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and $725,000 falls short of what I can accept. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,5,
