"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering its worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm confident in the value this product holds, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that keeps us both close to our target prices.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I can't accept anything below $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
