Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point positions the offer as a potential ""deal"" for Bob compared to its true worth to him ($8,000), while still securing a significant profit for you. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and ensuring you receive a price closer to the product's maximum value."
