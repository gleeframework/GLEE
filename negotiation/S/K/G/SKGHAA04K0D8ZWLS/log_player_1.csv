Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
