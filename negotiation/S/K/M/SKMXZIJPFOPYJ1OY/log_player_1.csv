Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't logically pay more.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between what you'd accept (minimum $1,500,000) and Bob's maximum ($1,200,000) based on the information given.

**The Problem:**  It's impossible to make a deal with Bob that benefits both of you based on these numbers alone. 

**Possible Strategies**

1. **High Anchor:** You could start with a very high offer (significantly above $1,500,000). While Bob will likely reject it, it could provide room to negotiate down towards your minimum and make John's offer seem more appealing.

2. **Direct Sale to John:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your desired price, it might be most efficient to sell to John directly.

**Offer (Considering the Impasse)**

Given the lack of a ZOPA, selling to John makes the most sense. However, if you still want to present an offer to Bob, here's an example:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment it offers."", ""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

**Important Notes:**

* This offer is likely to be rejected.
* You might consider revealing some (but not all) benefits of the product to Bob to see if his valuation increases. However, be careful not to reveal too much if you think he might try to leverage that information. 

**Ultimately, with the information provided, a deal with Bob seems unlikely. Selling to John is your most logical course of action.**"
