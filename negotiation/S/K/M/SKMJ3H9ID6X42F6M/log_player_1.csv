Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes it more likely you'll reach a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Knowing Your Bottom Line:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. This knowledge gives you leverage to push for a higher price with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $18,000 offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob rejects the initial price, Alice can always lower it, moving closer to her minimum while still aiming for a higher profit."
