Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have room to negotiate from a strong position. Starting high ($2,000,000) leaves space for potential negotiation downward while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" aims to frame the product as highly desirable to Bob.
* **Justification:**  While not essential, mentioning ""significant return on investment"" offers a reason for the high price without revealing your hand about other buyers.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob's input and signals that you're willing to discuss the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
