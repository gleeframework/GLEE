"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in.  It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price, which is still a good deal for you, Alice.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a fair price, I'm looking for something a little closer to my asking price of $100. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That would be a great deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $85. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",85.0,Bob,4,
