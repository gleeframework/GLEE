"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we settle at $10,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to come down a little more. Would you consider $10,250?  That's the best I can do.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
