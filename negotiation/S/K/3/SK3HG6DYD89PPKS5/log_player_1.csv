Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage.  You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob but also gets you as close to his maximum value as possible.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $750,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" to pique Bob's interest.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $750,000 is a significant discount for Bob, making it more enticing than his alternative options.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though you have a guaranteed buyer) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages a faster decision.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Response:** If Bob tries to negotiate further, be prepared to hold firm or consider a smaller concession. Remember, you have a strong position.
* **Relationship:** While maximizing profit is important, consider if a long-term relationship with Bob (if applicable) is worth potentially losing a bit of profit on this deal."
