"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a bit less. Would you be interested in buying it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

* **Buying from Alice saves you $20 compared to buying from John.** 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
