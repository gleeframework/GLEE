# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth an incredible $100 to you, and we're considering your offer. To make it a win-win situation, how about we agree on a price of $95? This way, you get a great deal on a valuable item, and I'm able to maximize the value of my product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  You can reject Alice's offer and still get the product from John, even if it's slightly more expensive."
