"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Given my budget and the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $10,000. This seems fair considering your cost and my needs.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This would be a good price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
