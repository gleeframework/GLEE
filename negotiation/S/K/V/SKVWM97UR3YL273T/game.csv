"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market price. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. It would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500.
