"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately undervalue myself. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to understand his reasoning. 
* I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the deal with Bob becomes too unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** While John's offer is a safe bet, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob. There's a possibility I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that undervalues my product. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum.
* I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and gauge his willingness to meet me halfway. 
* If Bob continues to offer significantly lower prices, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (partially):** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not completely caving in. This shows flexibility while still maintaining my value. 
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to emphasize why my price is justified.
* **Positive, but firm:** I use a friendly tone but am direct in stating my counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. 
* If he still offers significantly less, I'll need to evaluate whether to continue negotiations or take John's offer. 
* I'll try to understand Bob's reasoning for his low offers to better adjust my approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market price. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum of $15,000,  $14,000 still falls short. 
* **Potential for improvement:**  With five rounds left, there's still time to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed deal.  However, I'm motivated to see if I can get a slightly better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer again, likely with a price between $14,500 and $15,000.
* I'll closely monitor Bob's responses to gauge his willingness to move closer to my price.
*  If Bob's offers remain too low, I'll strongly consider accepting John's offer to avoid risking a deal that doesn't meet my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. It would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Focusing on fairness:** I emphasize that this price is ""fair for both of us"" to encourage a sense of collaboration.
* **Maintaining value:**  I'm still above my minimum, but this offer shows I'm serious about making a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this offer.
* If he rejects again, I'll need to make a tough decision about accepting John's offer or continuing to negotiate.
* I'll consider using a more firm tone if Bob continues to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market price. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $13,500 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate further, especially considering Bob's stubbornness.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids risking a further decrease in value.

**Next Steps:**

* It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale.
* I'll contact John and finalize the deal. 
* While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, I've minimized my risk and secured a satisfactory outcome."
