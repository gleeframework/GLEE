"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a high-quality item that I believe will greatly benefit you, given its value to you is $15,000. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. You have a significant margin between your maximum price ($15,000) and Alice's offer, leaving room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I'm looking to stay within a stricter budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while accommodating your financial considerations. Please let me know if this revised proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  He can save $4,000 compared to buying from John, and it's closer to his target price.  There's not much room left for further negotiation, so accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
