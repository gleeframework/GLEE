**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice is offering it for $120.  Since you have another option to buy it from John for the same price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  You could potentially negotiate with Alice to get a lower price, but you don't have any information about her minimum acceptable price."
