Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value it holds for you as well. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a substantial amount, it's still below my minimum valuation of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  However, John's offer of $1,000,000 remains a viable alternative if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 falls significantly short of my minimum asking price. While I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm unable to accept your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us to both walk away with a satisfactory outcome."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, Alice. However, I still believe that $950,000 was a reasonable starting point. I'm willing to consider an offer closer to my initial proposal. Let's aim for $975,000. This still allows for a substantial discount from your original price while respecting my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum valuation, it's still below it. I'm committed to maximizing my earnings and will continue to negotiate with Bob. John's offer remains a strong alternative if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue working towards a solution.  However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's aim for $1,000,000. This would allow me to meet my minimum requirement while providing you with a fair price.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
