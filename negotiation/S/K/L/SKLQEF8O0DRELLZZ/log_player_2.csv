"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, it's likely he can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I really appreciate it, but I'm hoping to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:**  $135 is a fair compromise considering Bob's initial counteroffer of $130.
* **Time is a factor:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, he's already gone through two rounds. Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product for a good price without potentially wasting more time.
* **John's offer:**  Remember, John is selling for $150.  This makes Alice's offer the better deal."
