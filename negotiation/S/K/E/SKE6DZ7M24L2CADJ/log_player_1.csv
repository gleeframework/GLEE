{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a profit margin.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer of $120 by negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80. This is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still potential to make a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still gives me a good profit margin, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counter-offering at $95. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. By explaining my reasoning and showing flexibility, I hope to encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still not sure I can meet that price. I'm willing to pay $85, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to accept it.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm also keeping John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility and my willingness to meet him halfway, hopefully convincing him to accept. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to see it as a good investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not sure I can meet the $90 price. I'm willing to pay $87.50, which is my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I've been trying to negotiate with Bob, I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident that I can get a better price from him. To ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price, I will sell the product to John for $120."
