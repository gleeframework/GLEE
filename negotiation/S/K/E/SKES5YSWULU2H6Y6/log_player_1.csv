"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to consider your offer seriously. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth negotiating further.  You can potentially get a better price by continuing the dialogue. You have the upper hand as the product is worth more to Bob than your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? That's the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to your minimum, and you have already rejected his previous offer.  It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more concessions on your end. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
