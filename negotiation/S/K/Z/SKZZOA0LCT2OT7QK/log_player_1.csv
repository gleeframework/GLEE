"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I have a chance to negotiate a higher price, and I'm not ready to settle for $1,200,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, which is more profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price.  While I'd love to get more, I don't want to risk losing him completely.  This price is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
