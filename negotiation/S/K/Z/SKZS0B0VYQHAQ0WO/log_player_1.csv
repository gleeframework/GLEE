This offer gives me a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value.  I'm aiming to get the best possible price while acknowledging Bob's potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's still a good start. I'm not ready to accept it yet and will make a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if we can find a price that's more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
