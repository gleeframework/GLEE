You can do better than $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

$13,000 is a good deal for you. You're getting the product for less than your maximum budget and it's better than what John is offering."
