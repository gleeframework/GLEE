Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only have one chance to make a deal with Bob.

**Strategy**

The ideal offer aims to maximize your profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Considering its significant value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects a win-win scenario for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** Directly address Bob and highlight the ""exclusive opportunity.""
* **Value Emphasis:** Mention the product's ""significant value and potential"" to reinforce his positive perception.
* **Justification:**  Frame the price as ""fair"" and a ""win-win."" This suggests you've put thought into it and aren't just aiming for the highest possible amount.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a $50,000 gain (compared to his $1,200,000 valuation).

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:**  You need to be prepared for Bob to negotiate further. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower.
* **Time Constraint (Optional):**  Adding a time constraint to your offer (e.g., ""This offer is valid for 24 hours."") can sometimes encourage a quicker decision."
