Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, but it still gives me a good profit. It leaves room for negotiation, but it's also high enough that I can still get a good price if Bob doesn't counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my target. I believe I can push him a bit further with a counteroffer.  I'm still confident I can get a better price than what John is offering."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle and settle on $1,100,000.  I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him. The fact that he is willing to negotiate shows that he wants the product and is likely to increase his offer further. Selling to John would guarantee me a solid amount, but I believe I can do better with Bob."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not going to budge much further. I've already made several concessions, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,075,000 ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of ending up with only $800,000 from John.  It's time to close the deal and secure a good outcome."
