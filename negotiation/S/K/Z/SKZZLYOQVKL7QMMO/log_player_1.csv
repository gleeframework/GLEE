Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident that Bob will be motivated to negotiate, as he values the product at $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully gets us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiations. Accepting his offer will guarantee a sale at a price that's only slightly below my ideal."
