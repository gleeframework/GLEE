**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffers are increasing too slowly.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would mean a loss of $275,000 compared to John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations short and secure the guaranteed profit."
