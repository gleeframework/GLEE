,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm trying to stay under $8,000.  Would you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $8,000, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we settle on $7,800? This is just a little bit higher than your offer, but it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here!",7800.0,Alice,5,
