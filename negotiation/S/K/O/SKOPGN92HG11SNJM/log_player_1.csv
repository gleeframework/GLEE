* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price between these values maximizes your potential profit. Aiming closer to Bob's valuation increases your earnings.
* **The Chosen Price:** $1,300,000 gives Bob a potential $200,000 gain while netting you $300,000 more than your fallback offer.

**The Message:**

The message is crafted to be straightforward and positive, highlighting the product's value but avoiding overly aggressive sales tactics."
