"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has immense value, but I still think $1,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer. Can we consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a decent offer, we're still in early rounds and have room to push for a better price.  We'll aim to counter closer to his perceived value in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,080,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair return for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. Can we consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could potentially push for a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,020,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant profit above our minimum, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal."
