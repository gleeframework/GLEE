Round 2

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,500. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal for me. It's above my minimum and it seems Bob is serious about making a purchase. There's no guarantee I can get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
