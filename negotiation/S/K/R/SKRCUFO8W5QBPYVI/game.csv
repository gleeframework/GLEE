"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $90 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $75, and I think that's a very fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,6,

"I've already met you halfway, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $85. That's the lowest I can go.",85.0,Alice,7,
