Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already met you halfway, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $85. That's the lowest I can go.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John to maximize your savings."
