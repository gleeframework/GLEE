"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $20,000 is not a good option. Buying from John for $15,000 is the best option if you can't negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Therefore, you should reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
