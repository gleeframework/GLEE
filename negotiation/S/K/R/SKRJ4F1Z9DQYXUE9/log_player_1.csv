Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice doesn't know this. It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $12,000 offer provides room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above Alice's $10,000 minimum.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning that she'll list it publicly implies that this is a limited-time offer, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has the security of John's $10,000 offer. This allows her to negotiate from a position of strength, potentially countering with a lower price closer to $10,000 if needed."
