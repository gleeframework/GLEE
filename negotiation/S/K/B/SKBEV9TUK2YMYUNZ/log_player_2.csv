"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above the product's worth to her. This means there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given your own valuation of the product, I'd like to offer $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and wasting more rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product."
