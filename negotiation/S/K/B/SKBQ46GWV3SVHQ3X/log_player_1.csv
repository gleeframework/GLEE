Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're open to negotiation.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $120, which is my absolute limit.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.
