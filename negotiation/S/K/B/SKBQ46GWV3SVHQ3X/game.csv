"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to offers, but I'm starting at $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're open to negotiation.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $110 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $120, which is my absolute limit.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,4,
