"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This price is still fair for both of us and allows us to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1025000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1037500. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
