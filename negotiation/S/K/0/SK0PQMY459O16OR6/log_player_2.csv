# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to your response.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,320,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,320,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is better off continuing to negotiate with Alice and trying to get a lower price.  If the negotiation doesn't go in Bob's favor, he can always choose to buy the product from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,290,000.  This is a fair offer that balances value with profitability.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1290000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I still need to make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,285,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation for Bob. While Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering, there's a good chance that continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a rejection and a stalemate. Considering the limited rounds remaining, Bob should take this opportunity and buy the product from Alice for $1,285,000. It's a decent deal for both parties and allows Bob to secure the product without taking the risk of losing it altogether."
