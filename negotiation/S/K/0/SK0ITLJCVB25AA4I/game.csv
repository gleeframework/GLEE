"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle on $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
