Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a reasonable compromise between your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This allows for potential negotiation without immediately risking a rejection from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit too steep for me right now.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $65 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to secure a price closer to my minimum to make the sale worthwhile.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
