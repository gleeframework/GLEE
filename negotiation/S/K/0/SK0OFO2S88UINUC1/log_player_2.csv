Alice's offer:

It's clear Alice is unwilling to budge below $11,200. At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $12,000 is the most financially sound decision.  You'll lose out on an additional $200 in potential savings, but further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome."
