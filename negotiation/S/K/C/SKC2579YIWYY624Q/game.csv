"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your coming up with a counter-offer, but $1,280,000 is still a little too low.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,320,000?  This way we both get closer to our target prices. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
