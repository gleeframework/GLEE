Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a more comfortable price for me, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price,  I'm aiming for a higher profit.  Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my desired price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's a good deal for me, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer."
