{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth more to Alice than to you.  Alice's offer is far too high.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to start the negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm starting with my maximum price, knowing that this is what I would pay John.  This sets a clear boundary and hopefully starts a productive negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my target, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  There are still rounds to go, and I want to see if I can get her down to my maximum price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price. Although it's getting closer, I'm not willing to pay more than $8,000. There are still several rounds left, so I want to see if I can convince her to lower her price further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm increasing my offer again, but staying just below $10,000.  This shows Alice that I am serious about buying the product, but still won't go above my maximum price.  Hopefully, with only four rounds left, Alice will be more willing to compromise."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
