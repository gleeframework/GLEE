"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $9,000.  You have room to negotiate and potentially save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $8750. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. Accepting her offer means you get the product for $8,750, saving you $1,250 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and then potentially increasing the price further is too high.  It's better to secure the deal at this point."
