,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 falls significantly short of what I have in mind.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're both making progress.  $1,900,000 is still too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
