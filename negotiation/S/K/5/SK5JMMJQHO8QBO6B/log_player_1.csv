"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  We start significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This sets a high anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The inflated price allows us to make concessions throughout multiple rounds while still aiming for a final price well above $1,500,000. 
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high initial price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how motivated he is to acquire the product. 
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down, we have a strong starting point.
3. **Maintain the Option of John:**  We can walk away and accept John's offer at any time if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Interest:** Bob's rejection of our initial high price was expected. However, his counteroffer of $1,200,000 shows he's serious about purchasing the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,200,000 is below our minimum, it's a significant jump from his perceived value of $1,000,000. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We still have the security of John's offer.

We'll reject Bob's offer in Round 2 to continue negotiations and aim for a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 falls significantly short of what I have in mind.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price ($300,000 decrease) to signal flexibility.
* **Staying Above Target:** However, we're still significantly above both our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer. This leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Encouraging Movement:** By making a substantial move, we're putting the onus on Bob to respond in kind if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're both making progress.  $1,900,000 is still too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 exceeds our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Position:**  While we could potentially negotiate for more, Bob has consistently moved upward, indicating strong interest.  
* **Time Value of Money:** Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or Bob potentially walking away.

It's a good deal, and we should take it!"
