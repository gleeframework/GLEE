Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 falls significantly short of what I have in mind.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
