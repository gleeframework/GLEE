"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My counteroffer is $12,000. I think this is a price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to hold out for it.",12000.0,Alice,5,
