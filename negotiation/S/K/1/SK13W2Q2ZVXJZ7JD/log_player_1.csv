Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, she starts high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offered price leaves room for negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, and Alice can slightly reduce the price while still remaining above her minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential worth,"" Alice emphasizes the product's benefits, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product before it goes to John."
