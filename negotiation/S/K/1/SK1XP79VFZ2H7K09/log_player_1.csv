Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000. Let me know if you're interested, this is a limited-time offer!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still profitable for you.
* **Limited-Time Offer:** Creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly rather than overthink it. 

**Important:** It's key to remember this is just the opening offer.  You can always adjust your price during the negotiation if Bob counters."
