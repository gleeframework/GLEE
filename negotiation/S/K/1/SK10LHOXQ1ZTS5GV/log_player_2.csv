"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential. My asking price is $1800000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work for me, I'm willing to pay $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, to make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1500000. This price still leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident it's a fair value given the product's potential. Let's continue to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial offer, it's still significantly higher than Bob's budget. It's important for Bob to continue pushing for a lower price, especially with 7 rounds remaining. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob could potentially get a much better deal.  Buying from John right now would be premature, especially since Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product.  $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1000000 is still below my minimum threshold. To make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1300000.  This price is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects the true value of this product. I'm confident we can find a final price that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has reduced her price significantly. However, $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's worth continuing the negotiation, hoping to get a price closer to Bob's budget. It's important to keep in mind that Bob can always buy from John for $800,000 as a last resort, but there's still room for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,300,000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  To find a price that works for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair and realistic price considering the potential value of the product, and I'm confident we can close this deal. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $1100000 is getting closer, but I need to be at least $1200000 to make this deal work for me.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's aim for a final agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob should continue negotiating. He has 3 more rounds left and still has the option of buying from John at $800,000. There's still potential to reach a better deal with Alice."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm encouraged by our progress and your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone.  To finalize a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
