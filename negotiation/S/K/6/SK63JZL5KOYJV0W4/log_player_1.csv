{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. This price reflects the true market value and allows for a significant profit margin for you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but still leaves a healthy profit margin for me. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive and encouraging way, highlighting the potential benefits and profit for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick deal while maximizing my profit. By offering a slightly lower price initially, I increase the chances of Bob accepting. If he rejects, I'll have room to negotiate further, but I'll always have the option to go with John for my guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept a quick deal, it's important to remember that I can still secure a much higher price with John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, and I'm offering you a final price of $1,250,000.  This takes into account the value you mentioned, while still allowing me to recoup some of my investment. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer, giving us both room to feel like we've won something in the negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the need to find ""common ground"" and close the deal.  This suggests that I'm willing to be flexible, but also signals that I'm not going to go much lower. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible, while still maintaining the possibility of a deal. I believe that $1,250,000 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of this opportunity. If he rejects, I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm close to my minimum acceptable price with Bob, it's not quite there yet. I've been flexible and made concessions. However, my goal is to maximize my profit, and  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me the best outcome. 

**Strategy:**

I've decided that further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to yield a significantly better result than what John is offering.  It's time to secure the guaranteed profit and move on."
