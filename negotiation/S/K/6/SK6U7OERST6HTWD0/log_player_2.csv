"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is quite close to her value, leaving little room for negotiation in our favor. We can start by rejecting and proposing a significantly lower counter-offer to gauge her willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice is coming closer to our acceptable range, but we're still above John's price. Let's keep negotiating and see if we can push her further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $8,000 might have been a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is closer, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our target price, and there's no point in negotiating further. Accepting her offer gets us the product at the best possible price."
