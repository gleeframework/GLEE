"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 might have been a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That seems like a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is closer, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",10000.0,Alice,5,
