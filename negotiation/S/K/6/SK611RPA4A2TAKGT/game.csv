"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the value it would bring to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $10,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
