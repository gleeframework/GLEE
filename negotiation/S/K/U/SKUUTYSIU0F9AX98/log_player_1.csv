Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, reflecting the value of the product to me. It gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum. This also signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price and well below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price and what Bob offered. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still significantly lower than my desired price. While $900,000 is better than his previous offer, it's still not worth the continued negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which meets my minimum and is a more secure option."
