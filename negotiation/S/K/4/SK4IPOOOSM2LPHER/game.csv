"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a healthy profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe $950,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $987,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit and me a good price.  Let me know what you think.",987500.0,Bob,4,
