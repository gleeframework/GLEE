{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, but it also leaves room for me to make some profit.  I'm not offering the full $1,300,000 (the midpoint between our values) right away because I want to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me.  It's much less than my minimum price of $1,000,000, and it's also significantly below the midpoint between our values. I'm not going to accept such a low offer, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $1,100,000? This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. Could we consider $1,050,000 as a compromise between our previous offers? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $1,000,000, and it's also closer to my initial offer.  It's worth it to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000."
