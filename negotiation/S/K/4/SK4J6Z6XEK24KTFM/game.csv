"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. This would still be a significant gain for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still unable to meet your asking price of $875,000. I've considered all my options and am now prepared to offer $860,000 for the product. This amount still allows me to stay within my budget while recognizing the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",860000.0,Bob,4,
