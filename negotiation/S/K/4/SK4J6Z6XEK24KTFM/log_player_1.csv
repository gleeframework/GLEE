Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the value and opportunity for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $900,000, I have space to negotiate down without dropping below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as Safety Net:** The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Opportunity to Improve:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable deal.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to negotiate with Bob without being pressured to accept a low offer. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. This would still be a significant gain for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum desired profit.
* **Appeal to Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value and how this price still represents a good deal for him.
* **Closing Statement:** I conclude with a call to action, encouraging Bob to accept my counteroffer and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still unable to meet your asking price of $875,000. I've considered all my options and am now prepared to offer $860,000 for the product. This amount still allows me to stay within my budget while recognizing the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $860,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting this offer ensures a profit of $60,000, which is better than the potential risk of a longer negotiation or a rejected offer. 

**Next Steps:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
