"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a great asset to your business. I understand its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a slightly reduced price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount considering the true value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your operations. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
