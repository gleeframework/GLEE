{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's closer to my desired $150 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's still a decent starting point for negotiation. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $155?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but I still think $155 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $145, but I'm still not sure I can go that high. I'd be willing to pay $142 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I've already made several concessions.  I'm not sure I can get him to go any higher, and it's getting time-consuming.  I'm confident I can sell to John for $150, which is a better deal for me than accepting Bob's offer."
