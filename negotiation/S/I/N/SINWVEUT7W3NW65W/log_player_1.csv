Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value creates a win-win situation. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. "", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Price:** $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential $100,000 gain, making it a very attractive offer. It also nets you a $200,000 profit over your minimum.

**Important Note:**  While you have a backup offer, pushing Bob too close to his maximum ($1,500,000) could make him reconsider. This offer balances profit maximization with deal closure probability."
