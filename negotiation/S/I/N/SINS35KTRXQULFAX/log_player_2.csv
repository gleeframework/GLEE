"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John for a guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer and our maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and suggests that $100 is a ""fair"" price, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Strategic:** We are testing Alice's willingness to negotiate down from her initial offer. Her response will give us more information to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice's offer of $125 is within our budget of $120 and a significant discount from her initial price.
* **Minimal Savings from John:** While John offers the product for $120, the potential savings of $5 are probably not worth the risk of further negotiation. Alice might not go any lower.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice takes more time and effort. Accepting this offer provides a good balance of price and efficiency."
