Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to John's offer. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially swaying him towards accepting the offer. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, by starting with a higher price, we leave room for negotiation or can still fall back on John's offer."
