Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product and me to secure a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll unfortunately have to move forward with another buyer.
