"I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product and me to secure a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1,050,000? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,050,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,150,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll unfortunately have to move forward with another buyer. ",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1,050,000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
