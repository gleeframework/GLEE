Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable enough to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer matches the value of the product to me.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
