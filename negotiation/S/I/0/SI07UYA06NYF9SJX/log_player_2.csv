Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $125, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit expensive.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I can do $115, and that's the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than $115.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $100 guarantees I stay within my budget and avoids potentially drawn-out negotiations."
