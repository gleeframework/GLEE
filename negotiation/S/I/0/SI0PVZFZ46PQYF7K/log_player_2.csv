"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you than John's:**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. This means you'll save $30 compared to buying from John. 
* **Even if you reject Alice's offer, you're still getting the product:** You have a fallback option with John, so there's no risk in accepting Alice's lower price."
