"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $650,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to meet you at $550,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $600,000. This is a compromise that I think is more reasonable, given the product's worth to you.",600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  While $600,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $575,000?",575000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the price even lower, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $610,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",610000.0,Alice,5,
