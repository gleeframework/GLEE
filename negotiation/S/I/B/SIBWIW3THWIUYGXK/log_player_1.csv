I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price close to the product's worth to Bob, but ensuring I still get a good profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,400,000."

I'm lowering my price a bit to $1,300,000, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to meet me in the middle now."
