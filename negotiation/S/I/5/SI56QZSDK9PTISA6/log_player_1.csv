Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has signaled that $990,000 is his absolute limit. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit ($990,000 is still well above our minimum) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds.  It's always best to secure a good deal when it's on the table."
