"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential worth.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer, but $1,080,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $960,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $960,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of the value this represents.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,020,000? This reflects my effort to find a middle ground.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
