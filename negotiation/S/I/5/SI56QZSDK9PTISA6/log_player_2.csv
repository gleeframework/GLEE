"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you about this opportunity.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering the product at $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and leaves room for mutual benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Explanation: Alice's opening offer is quite close to her own valuation, leaving little room for negotiation. It's highly likely we can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $850,000."", ""product_price"": 850000}

**Explanation:**

* **Anchoring:**  We're starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($850,000) to try and anchor the negotiation closer to our desired range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While aggressive, this counter-offer provides  space for us to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $1,000,000 maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This low offer will help us gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to move from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved down in price, but $1,080,000 is still above our maximum budget. We're getting closer, but we need to keep negotiating. We'll make another counter-offer and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer, but $1,080,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $960,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 960000}

**Explanation:**

* **Conveying Progress:** Acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate helps maintain a positive tone.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Proposing a price exactly halfway between her current offer ($1,080,000) and our previous counter-offer ($850,000) can appear like a reasonable compromise. 
* **Staying Below Budget:**  This counter-offer keeps us under our $1,000,000 limit while leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $960,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of the value this represents.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,020,000? This reflects my effort to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Explanation:**

We're in a delicate stage now. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but  $1,020,000 is still above our absolute limit. We need to signal that we're very close to our maximum while encouraging her to move closer to the $1,000,000 mark. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open. We'll provide a counter-offer in the next round that is very close to our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been great to work with, and I think we're very close to a deal.  My absolute limit on this is $990,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to finalize this today."", ""product_price"": 990000}

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Respectful:** We're setting a firm limit this round, making it clear that $990,000 is our final offer. 
* **Urgency and Closing:**  Expressing a desire to close the deal today adds a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to make a decision.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $990,000 leaves a small gap for Alice to potentially counter with $995,000 â€“ still a win for us and potentially more appealing than a flat rejection."
