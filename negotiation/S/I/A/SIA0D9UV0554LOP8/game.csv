"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $925,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",925000.0,Bob,4,
