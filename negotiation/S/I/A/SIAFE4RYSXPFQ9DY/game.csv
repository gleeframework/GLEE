"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is appealing, the value this product represents, especially in the long term, is truly unique. To meet somewhere in the middle, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the significant value this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price.  While $1,450,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
