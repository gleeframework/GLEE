Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think I've already made my last counteroffer in the previous round. Since I chose to reject Alice's offer and send a counteroffer, I should have sent a new counteroffer in the previous round, not another reject offer. Let me correct that.

Since I've already rejected the offer, I'll make a new counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""message"": ""I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm not willing to pay $21,000. I'm willing to meet you at $18,500, but that's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 18500}"
