"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $22000.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $22000. How about we meet in the middle at $19500? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",19500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $19500 price point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to make a decent profit. I can offer it to you for $21000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",21000.0,Alice,5,
