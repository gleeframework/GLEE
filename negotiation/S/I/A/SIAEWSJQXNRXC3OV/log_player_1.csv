Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still being a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price makes it seem like you're offering Bob a good deal, increasing the chance he'll accept without negotiation."
