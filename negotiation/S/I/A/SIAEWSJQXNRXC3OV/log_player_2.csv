"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $140 is less than its value to her, you can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John is the most cost-effective option."
