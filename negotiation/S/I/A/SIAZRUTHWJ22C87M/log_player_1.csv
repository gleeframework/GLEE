``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($12,000).  This leaves room for negotiation.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my price point.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John because I still have 8 rounds left and the potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still just a hair away from my minimum.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to move just a bit higher. I only have 2 rounds left, so I need to be strategic. If I don't get a better price, I'll sell to John in the next round."
