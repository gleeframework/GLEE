Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $100. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  While you value the product at $120 and Bob values it at $80, offering it at $100 might be appealing to him. It's a potential win-win â€“ you get more than your minimum, and Bob gets what he perceives as a deal. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120 gives you leverage. You don't *have* to go below $100 because you have a guaranteed sale.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  There are other valid approaches depending on your negotiation style and how much risk you're willing to take."
