"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of a quick deal while also maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle yet. I believe I can still get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
