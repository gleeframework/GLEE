"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is only $1,000 below that. There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the best price possible.  By offering $12,000, he's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within his budget. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for both parties to potentially compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a significant reduction from her previous offer and is only $1,500 above Bob's ideal price.  It's a good deal for Bob, especially considering he has a backup option at $15,000.  Accepting now ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential for Alice to walk away."
