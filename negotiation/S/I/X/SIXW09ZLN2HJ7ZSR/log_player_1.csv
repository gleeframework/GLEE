"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a strong offer above your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justifying the Price:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob helps justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves space for negotiation and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and a strong alternative with John. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about getting a better price and encourage him to increase his offer substantially in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This reflects the product's potential for significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** This offer shows willingness to negotiate by making a substantial reduction from the initial price. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, the counteroffer stays firmly above Bob's valuation and closer to your minimum. The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):**  While not stated explicitly, the message hints at the product's desirability by suggesting there's a ""middle ground"" that needs to be found quickly. This could motivate Bob to make a more serious offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value of the product, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me and a fair price considering the potential benefits.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $950,000 is still under your $1,000,000 minimum. Bob is clearly willing to move upwards, and you have the security of John's offer.  It's worth risking another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've given this offer serious thought, and to be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  Therefore, I'm willing to make a final offer: $1,050,000. This is my absolute best price."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer establishes a firm boundary while still leaving a small margin for negotiation. It's important to emphasize that this is your best price to signal that you won't go any lower.
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning the other buyer (without revealing John's higher offer) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. 
* **Finality:** By calling this your ""final offer,"" you signal that you're serious and willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept. This increases the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $975,000, which is a substantial investment on my end and a fair price considering the market value. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away. Bob is unlikely to meet your $1,000,000 minimum. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below your target price. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which ensures you don't lose out on the product's value.  

While there's a chance Bob might eventually offer slightly more, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. You've negotiated skillfully and secured your minimum acceptable price with John."
