Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appear reasonable:** While high, the offer isn't outrageously above Bob's perceived value, potentially making him consider it.
* **Provide a safety net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing John will buy it for $12,000."
