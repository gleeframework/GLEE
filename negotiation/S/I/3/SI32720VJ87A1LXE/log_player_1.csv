``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to give up on a potential higher price.
* **Room for compromise:** I can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which still represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $115 to $110.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $105 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to go up to $110? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain my position:** I'm holding firm at $110, the same price I offered in Round 3, demonstrating my commitment to that value.
* **Focus on compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a way to find a ""fair price"" for both of us.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language like ""willingness to compromise"" and ""fair price"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **John's offer:** I still have John's offer as a backup, allowing me to be assertive in my counteroffer.
* **Strategic advantage:** This counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to close the deal without needing to make a further counteroffer."

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **John's offer is still better:**  I can sell to John for $120, which is a significantly better deal.
* **Limited time:**  We're now in Round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left.  Staying with Bob is risky, as he might not budge further.
* **Potential to close the deal:**  While I'm not happy with $107, there's still a chance Bob might increase his offer slightly in the next round. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 7, trying to get closer to my desired price.  However, I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my minimum requirements soon."

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $111, which is just $2 above Bob's offer and only $9 below my minimum acceptable price.  This is a strong signal that I'm willing to make a final concession.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're in Round 9, and I only have one round left. I need to push for a deal, but I also want to ensure I get as close to my desired price as possible.
* **John's Offer:** I'm fully aware of John's offer of $120, giving me the confidence to stand firm at $111.

* **Risk of No Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement at all.
