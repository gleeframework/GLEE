"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. It's a great opportunity for you to acquire something special.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, and since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and buying from John for the same price makes no difference in cost.  You're not gaining anything by accepting Alice's offer."
