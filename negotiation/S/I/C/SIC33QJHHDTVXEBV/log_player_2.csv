"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation and potentially getting an even better deal.  Bob can counteroffer and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and also lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a further negotiation."
