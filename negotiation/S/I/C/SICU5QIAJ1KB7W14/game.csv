"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right away.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This still allows me to make a fair profit, and it's a significant step towards your offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",9000.0,Bob,4,
