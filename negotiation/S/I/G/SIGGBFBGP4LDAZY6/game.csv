"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the initial price. However, $650,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, to be realistic, the $1,100,000 price point is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your final offer is still a bit too high for me. I understand this is a valuable product, but I have a firm budget on this. If you're willing to come down to $750,000, we have a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
