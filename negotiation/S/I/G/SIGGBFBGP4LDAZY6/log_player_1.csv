**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a consistent unwillingness to meet Alice's price expectations.  While his offers are increasing, the increments are small, and he's still far below Alice's minimum acceptable price. At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob presents a significant risk of ending up with a final price far below John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer. 

It's time for Alice to cut her losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
