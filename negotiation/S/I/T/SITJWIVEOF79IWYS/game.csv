"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $8,750? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,
