"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000.  This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can find a solution.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the significant value this product offers. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $1,200,000. I understand this may not be your ideal price, but it's the highest I'm willing to go.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm offering $1,400,000 as my final counteroffer.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's make it happen.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $1,300,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options. ",1350000.0,Alice,7,
