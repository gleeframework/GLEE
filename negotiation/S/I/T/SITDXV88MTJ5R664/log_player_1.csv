"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start."",
""product_price"": 200
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to pay up to $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob is already offering the maximum amount he's willing to pay. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of not finding another buyer willing to pay my desired price."
