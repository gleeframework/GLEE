```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be happy to pay $12500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to be closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but I'm still looking to spend closer to $12500. Let's split the difference and go with $12750. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting close to a deal, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to continue haggling with Bob. I'm better off selling to John and securing the guaranteed $15,000."
