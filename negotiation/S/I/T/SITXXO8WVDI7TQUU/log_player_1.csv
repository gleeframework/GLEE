Round 2
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than $90, but I'm keeping an eye on John. If I can't get closer to my goal, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $90 is lower than my initial price.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $100. I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, but I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  It's a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Bob's offer of $88 is too low for me, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
