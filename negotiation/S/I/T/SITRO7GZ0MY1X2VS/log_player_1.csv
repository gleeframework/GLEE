"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in the higher price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for further negotiation.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good deal considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of not reaching an agreement.  I'll accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
