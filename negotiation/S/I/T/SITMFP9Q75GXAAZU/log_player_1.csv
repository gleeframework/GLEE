{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than $12,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response. 

By starting with a strong offer, you set the stage for a successful negotiation while ensuring you don't leave money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to send a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $13,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $13,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
