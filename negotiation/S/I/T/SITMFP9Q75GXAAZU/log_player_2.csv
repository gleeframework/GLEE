"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You can get a better deal by counteroffering.  $14,000 is still above your maximum, and you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $13,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $13,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to Alice and $15,000 to you.  Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for both of you.  You will get the product for less than what you are willing to pay, and Alice will get a higher price than what she is willing to sell for."
