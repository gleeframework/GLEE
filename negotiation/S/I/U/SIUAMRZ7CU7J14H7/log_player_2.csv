"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to spend no more than $150. Alice's offer is too high.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $100 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's within my budget of $150.  I'm better off accepting this offer than risking another round of negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at $150."
