``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to make him more willing to compromise. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not too far from Bob's potential maximum, allowing for some give and take during negotiations.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,400,000. This is the most I can afford at this time. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's important to remember my goal is to maximize profit.  By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain my position:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Explore further negotiations:**  I can try to negotiate a better price in the next round.
* **Secure a better deal:**  There's still a chance of getting closer to my target price or even reaching a deal with John for $1,500,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering your potential gains. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate.  
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth and highlight the potential gains, hoping to motivate him to come closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** While I've lowered my price, I'm still above my minimum, demonstrating my commitment to maximizing profit.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is clear and concise, emphasizing my willingness to reach an agreement while maintaining a firm stance."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to consider $1,500,000 as a counteroffer. I believe this price reflects a balance between the product's value and my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might retract his offer or I might not reach a better price. Accepting his offer ensures I achieve my minimum goal and secure a sale. Additionally,  John is offering the same price, so there's no advantage to selling to him instead."
