Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,050 again, just like in round 7? I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to hold firm at this point.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $11,000 mark and only budging very slightly.  At this point, it's unlikely we'll get a better deal from Alice than $11,000, which is still $1,000 more than her product is worth to her. It's better to cut our losses and buy from John for $12,000. We've spent considerable time negotiating and risking a worse outcome."
