"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $11,250? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While the product is good, $11,250 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $10,750? ",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,000, the same price I initially offered? I'm confident you'll love the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  I can tell this product has value, but I need to stick to my budget. How about $10,800 and we have a deal?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession. How about we meet at $11,050? It's just a $50 increase from your last offer, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting down to the wire.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but this is my final offer. How about $10,900 and we close this out?",10900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,050 again, just like in round 7? I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to hold firm at this point.",11050.0,Alice,9,
