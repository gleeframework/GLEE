Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" Alice provides a subtle justification for the higher price without explicitly revealing her minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning listing it ""publicly,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he has an exclusive opportunity. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room to negotiate down to a price that is still significantly higher than John's offer."
