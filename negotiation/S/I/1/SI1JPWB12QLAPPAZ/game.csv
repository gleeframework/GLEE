"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  How about we split the difference?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can't go all the way to $95, but how about we meet at $100? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good value for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
