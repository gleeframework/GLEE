Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""potential value"" to subtly remind Bob why it's worth a significant investment.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward, stating the offer and encouraging a response.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher to allow for more bargaining room.
* **Relationship Importance:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is crucial, Alice might offer a slightly lower price as a gesture of goodwill.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing Alice's profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the deal."
