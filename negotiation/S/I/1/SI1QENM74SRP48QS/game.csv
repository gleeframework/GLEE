"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to sell for $10,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's try $11,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway from $12,000 to $12,500, and now you're asking me to go down to $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",13000.0,Alice,5,
