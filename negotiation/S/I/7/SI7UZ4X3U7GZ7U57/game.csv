"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my budget of $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone below my minimum price of $12,000 with my previous offer. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'll offer it to you for $12,000, which is my minimum price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
