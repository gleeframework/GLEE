It's something that I know will be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it can help you achieve [mention a specific benefit relevant to Bob]. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, reflecting the product's true value. I'm open to discussing a reasonable price, but this is a fair starting point. Let's talk!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value. While I'm eager to work with you, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the unique benefits this product offers. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.
