"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the value this product brings warrants a higher figure.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,200,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
