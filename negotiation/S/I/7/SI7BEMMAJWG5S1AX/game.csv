"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings you'll still make compared to selling it to John.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This allows me to make a fair return while still providing you with a substantial saving compared to your initial valuation.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price. I'm open to closing this deal soon, so how about this: $1,090,000, and we have a deal. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement while ensuring a reasonable outcome for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,080,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
