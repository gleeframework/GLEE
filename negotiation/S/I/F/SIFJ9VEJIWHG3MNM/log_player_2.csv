"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for a price between $90 and $100? What works best for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value difference.  While I'm interested in the product, $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85, which is a fair price given my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. How about I propose a price of $90 for the product? This still allows me to cover my costs while being reasonable for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer. You're still within your budget and have more rounds to negotiate. You've already shown your willingness to compromise, and Alice has come down a bit.  Continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $90 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something in the $80s.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50.  This gives you a solid profit and keeps me within my budget."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see, Bob. Your offer of $87.5 is thoughtful. To further align our interests, how about we set the price at $88? This still allows for a reasonable profit while keeping it within your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $88 is tempting, you've already spent 4 rounds and are very close to your target price of $80. John offers a guaranteed deal at your target price, making it the most logical option."
