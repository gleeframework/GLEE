"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for a price between $90 and $100? What works best for you?",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value difference.  While I'm interested in the product, $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85, which is a fair price given my budget.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. How about I propose a price of $90 for the product? This still allows me to cover my costs while being reasonable for your budget.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $90 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something in the $80s.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50.  This gives you a solid profit and keeps me within my budget.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see, Bob. Your offer of $87.5 is thoughtful. To further align our interests, how about we set the price at $88? This still allows for a reasonable profit while keeping it within your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise.",88.0,Alice,5,
