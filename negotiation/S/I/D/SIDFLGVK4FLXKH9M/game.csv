"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I believe this is a fair price that allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price. However, $600,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $700,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000 as a final offer. This is a significant discount from my initial price, but it's the lowest I can go. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",900000.0,Alice,5,
