Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth more to Bob than $10,000, so there's potential for a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price - how about $11,000? This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay $10,500 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to hear you're willing to go up. I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,600 is getting closer to my desired price range.  While I'd like a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit,  and it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
