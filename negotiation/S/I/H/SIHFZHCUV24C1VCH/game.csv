"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer and would greatly benefit your business. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $850,000?  That would be a workable number for me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. However, I've already compromised a lot on the price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's benefits.",875000.0,Alice,5,
