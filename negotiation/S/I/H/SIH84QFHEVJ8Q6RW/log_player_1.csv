```

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and opportunity, hoping to generate excitement in Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to counteroffer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a high-stakes negotiation, and I'm willing to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if the deal with Bob doesn't work out.
* I need to pay close attention to Bob's reactions and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I will use the next 9 rounds to try and extract the maximum value from Bob while staying aware of the potential for John's offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.** I'm not desperate to sell and want to maximize my profits.
* **I'm not afraid to push further.** I have 8 more rounds and the option to sell to John for $800,000 if needed.

**Next Round:**

```

**Next Round:**

* **Securing the Profit:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed profit of $800,000, which is substantial and secures my minimum target.

**Decision:**

Given the limited time and the close proximity of Bob's offer to John's, it's best to cut my losses and sell to John. This ensures a quick and profitable transaction without the risk of further negotiations."
