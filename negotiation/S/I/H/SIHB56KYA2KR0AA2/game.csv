"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I understand you have a budget to stick to. However, $125 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference? I'm offering the product for $150. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment, but I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our needs.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $135 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $142.50? I believe this offer is fair to both of us, and allows us to come to an agreement.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to suggest a price of $140 for the product. It's a small compromise from your last offer, but I hope it helps us reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product for $145. This is a fair price that benefits both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",145.0,Alice,7,
