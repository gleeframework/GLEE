Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price. I'm also trying to build a friendly rapport with Bob to make the negotiation smoother."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with a substantial loss. I'll proceed to the next round and counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I understand you have a budget to stick to. However, $125 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference? I'm offering the product for $150. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment, but I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $135 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $142.50? I believe this offer is fair to both of us, and allows us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 142.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to suggest a price of $140 for the product. It's a small compromise from your last offer, but I hope it helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for less, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I still have time left to reach a deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product for $145. This is a fair price that benefits both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I would like to propose a price of $142.50 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $142.50 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it is the best offer I've received so far.  I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal to another buyer. Accepting this offer will ensure I make a profit, though it's not the highest I could potentially get."
