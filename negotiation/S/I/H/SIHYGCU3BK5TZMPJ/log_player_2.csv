"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  $13,000 is only $1,000 more than Bob's counteroffer, and it's significantly less than what Bob would pay John.
* **There's a chance Alice might reject a lower counteroffer.**  It's possible Alice will hold firm at $13,000, and Bob could end up paying John $15,000 if he continues to negotiate.
* **Time is a factor.**  There are only 7 rounds left. Accepting now ensures a deal, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
