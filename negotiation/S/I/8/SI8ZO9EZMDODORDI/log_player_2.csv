# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer. To ensure we both achieve a satisfactory outcome, I propose a revised price of $1,150,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to our initial asking price and aligns more closely with the perceived value of the product to you. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.
