{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fantastic price, considering the value you'll be getting out of it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential bargaining. It's a strong initial position that emphasizes the value Bob will gain. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and potentially use John's offer as a bargaining chip to ensure I get a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While $750,000 is more than John's offer, I'm willing to risk the possibility of losing Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to pay $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
