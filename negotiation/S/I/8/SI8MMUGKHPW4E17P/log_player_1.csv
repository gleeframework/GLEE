"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strategic move to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's interested, it sets a good starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-offer and my own judgment of the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product above his initial price. This should encourage further negotiation and hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,500 is a good compromise, and I'm getting closer to my minimum. It's better than selling to John for $8,000 and I still have several rounds to potentially negotiate further."
