"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a special price of $12,000. This is a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product that's worth $8,000 to you. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation. It makes much more sense to go with your backup plan.
