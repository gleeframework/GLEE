Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $1,300,000. This price aligns better with what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher return. I'll counteroffer and see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while giving you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,325,000. This price respects your valuation while also staying within my budget.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer to see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I value your interest, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000, which represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1340000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,330,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell at that price.  I believe there's a good chance I can get a slightly higher price if I continue negotiating. There's also the option to sell to John for a significantly higher price, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. However, $1,330,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,335,000. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1335000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,332,500. This price respects your position while also being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,332,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,332,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, the negotiations with Bob have become increasingly incremental.  I'm not convinced I can get a much higher price from him in the next two rounds, and I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $1,350,000.  John's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher and eliminates any risk of further negotiation or a failed deal.  It's a no-brainer to sell to John at this point."
