(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a great deal at $500,000, but there's room to negotiate and potentially save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. It's significantly less than her initial price, but still above what I would pay from John. This will give us a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still better than John's, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can close the deal for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, but still below Alice's latest offer. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, while aiming to find a price we both can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, we're getting close to my limit. $450,000 is a good price and still significantly cheaper than John's offer.  It's time to accept and secure the product."
