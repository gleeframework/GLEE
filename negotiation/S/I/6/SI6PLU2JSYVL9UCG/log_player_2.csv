"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You can get the product for cheaper from John, so it's best to reject Alice's offer and see if she'll go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm open to negotiating further if that doesn't work for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.5 is better than Alice's first offer, you can still get the product for cheaper from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if she'll come down closer to your target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  If we can meet in the middle, I'm ready to buy."", ""product_price"": 90}
