"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
