Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John guarantees at least $1,000,000 allows for a stronger initial offer to Bob."
