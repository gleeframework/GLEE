"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $10,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go below $14,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you a deal at $13,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have a firm budget, and $13,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $11,800? I believe that's a fair compromise.",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $12,500. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,7,
