Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $910,000 is your highest offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll offer it to you for $915,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm, and we'll end up paying John's price of $1,000,000 anyway. Accepting $915,000 secures a saving compared to John's price."
