"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for this product. Would that be acceptable to you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your need for profit, I must stick to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $8,500 for the product?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there with $8,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal. Let's find common ground here!",8750.0,Alice,5,
