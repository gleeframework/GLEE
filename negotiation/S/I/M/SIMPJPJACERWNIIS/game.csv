"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product and the significant returns you'll see. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,200,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This offer represents a significant savings for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
