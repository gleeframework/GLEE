"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $8,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
