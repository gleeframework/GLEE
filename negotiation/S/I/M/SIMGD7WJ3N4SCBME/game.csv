"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $125? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my purchase within a $100 budget. Could we possibly meet at $100? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",100.0,Bob,4,
