{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some negotiation room while still giving me a good starting point.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low for me. My minimum acceptable price is $150, and I'm willing to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $125? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm offering $125 to Bob. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also trying to make him feel like he's getting a good deal by emphasizing that it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my purchase within a $100 budget. Could we possibly meet at $100? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on his $100 price, which is too low for me. I'm not willing to go that low, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from John. So, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
