"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe it's worth noting that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $1000000. With that in mind, I'll start by offering it to you for $1200000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. You need to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the value I'm getting from John's offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, it's still too high for you. You're willing to go up to $800,000 but need to continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, and I believe $900,000 is a fair price that reflects both our interests. It's a significant amount, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're committed to acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still hesitant to go below $1000000, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm not giving up too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You're better off buying from John at a lower price, even if it means missing out on the opportunity to acquire the product from Alice."
