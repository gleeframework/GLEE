"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe it's worth noting that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $1000000. With that in mind, I'll start by offering it to you for $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is outside my budget. Given the information you provided about John's offer, I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and shows my serious interest. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the value I'm getting from John's offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1050000 is still beyond my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, and I believe $900000 is a fair price that reflects both our interests. It's a significant amount, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're committed to acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still hesitant to go below $1000000, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm not giving up too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",980000.0,Alice,5,
