{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, and a $100,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point.  This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating, but also willing to be flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue pushing for a lower price.  He's not yet desperate enough to buy from John, as there's still a potential to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,125,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise, but still trying to meet in the middle.  This tactic keeps the negotiation moving and prevents a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,137,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,137,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come very close to Bob's previous offer.  At this point, the potential gain from further negotiation is small.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price,  and saves time and energy compared to continuing to negotiate.  While John is always an option, the risk of the negotiation collapsing and leaving Bob without a product is too high."
