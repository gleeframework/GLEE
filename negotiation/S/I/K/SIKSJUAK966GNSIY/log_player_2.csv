"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price of $12,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $10,500. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, her offer of $11,200 is still too high for me. I'm still hoping to get the price down further.  I'll counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,100 is still above my target price of $12,000.  While I've been able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile for me.  It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $12,000, as this is the maximum I'm willing to spend."
