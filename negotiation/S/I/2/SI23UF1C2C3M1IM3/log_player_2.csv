"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's a good deal, but Bob can likely do better.  He'll counteroffer to see if he can save even more."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is certainly valuable to me, $900,000 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000 for the product. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe it holds for you, while also acknowledging your desire to pay a lower price.

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  He'll counteroffer again to try to get closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll consider a price of $912,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I believe it holds for you, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500.

At this point, Bob has been negotiating and has managed to get the price down significantly.  He's close to his target price and a further negotiation might not yield much more savings. Buying from Alice at $912,500 is a good deal for Bob."
