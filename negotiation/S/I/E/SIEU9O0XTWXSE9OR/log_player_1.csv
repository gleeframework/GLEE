Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it to Bob at $150 (our minimum), there's a chance he'll accept a slightly lower price, giving us some profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $140 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Guarantee:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John if Bob declines. This safety net allows us to aim higher with Bob."
