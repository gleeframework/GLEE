Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I think $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. How about $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly hovering above our maximum price.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's offer of $8,000. We're better off securing the deal with John rather than risking further negotiation with Alice."
