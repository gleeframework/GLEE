"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800000.  Given the value to me is $1200000, I think this offer is fair and leaves us both with a profit.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's value to me is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves us both with a profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
