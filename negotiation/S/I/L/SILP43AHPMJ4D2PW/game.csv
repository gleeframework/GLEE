"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is still a little bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000, which would be $12,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,5,
