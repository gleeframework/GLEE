We are nearing the end of the negotiation process. Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, and with only 4 rounds left, I need to secure a deal.  Given the risk of a further negotiation breakdown, I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure a sale. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise considering the potential for further price reductions or a stalemate."
