"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 falls significantly short of its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
