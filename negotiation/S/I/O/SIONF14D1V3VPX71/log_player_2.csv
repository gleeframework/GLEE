"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Given its quality and unique features, it's worth more than what you would find on the market. Considering its value to you, I propose we keep the price at $120. This way, you get a great deal on a product that I believe will significantly benefit you, while also ensuring I receive a fair compensation for my investment. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your $80 limit and what John is offering. You can likely negotiate a better price or stick with buying from John."
