# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for the same price as Alice is offering, so I don't see any value in paying $950,000 when I can pay $1,000,000.
