Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I know you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $120, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning any price below this offers him a surplus.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering at $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still making the offer attractive to Bob. He gets a $30 discount from his perceived value, and you make $40 more than your minimum.

This strategy balances your risk (Bob rejecting) with the potential for a much higher profit than selling to John."
