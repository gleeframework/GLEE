,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it still allows you to get a good deal.  Let's find a middle ground.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",92.5,Bob,4,
