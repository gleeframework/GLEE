**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $75 is a reasonable price, saving you $5 compared to John's offer.
* **Final Offer:**  Alice stated this is her final offer. Pushing further might lead to her backing out. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks missing out on a decent deal. Getting it done now is valuable."
