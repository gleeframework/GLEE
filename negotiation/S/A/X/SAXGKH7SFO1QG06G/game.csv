"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a substantial sum and reflects my serious interest in the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
