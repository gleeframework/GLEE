"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare find, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Would you like to take it off my hands?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I can do $11500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $11500 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11500, which would be $11000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you reconsider?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $11000. I can meet you at $11250, but that's the lowest I can go. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm really struggling to go any higher. Can you meet me at $11000, or am I going to have to consider buying from John for $15000?",11000.0,Bob,8,
