"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working to find a price that works for both of us. While your product is good, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the current market.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $915,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your time, but I'm getting close to walking away from this deal. I can get a similar product elsewhere for a million. I'm willing to do $905,000, but that's absolutely my best offer.  If you can't do that, I'll need to explore other options.",905000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $905,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $910,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",910000.0,Alice,9,
