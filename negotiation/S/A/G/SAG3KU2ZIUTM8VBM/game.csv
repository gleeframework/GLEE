"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000.  Would you be willing to consider $850000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my previous offer, but $875000 is the lowest I can go. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while giving you a significant discount from my original offer. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $875000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",860000.0,Bob,4,
