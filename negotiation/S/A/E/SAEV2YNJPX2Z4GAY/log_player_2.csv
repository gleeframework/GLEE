"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to compromise to make the sale happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than buying from John for $10,000. Even though the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, saving $1,000 is a good deal."
