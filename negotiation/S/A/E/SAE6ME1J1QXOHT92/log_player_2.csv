Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $11000. I believe this is a fantastic opportunity for you to secure such a valuable asset at a discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, there's room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price through counter-offers.  There are 10 rounds available, providing opportunities to negotiate a better deal."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I am willing to adjust the price to $10500. I believe this still offers a competitive deal while ensuring we maintain a fair value for our product. I look forward to your feedback on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown a willingness to pay around $10,000. Alice has moved closer to that number, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a price closer to his desired target.  He has 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to see if Alice will budge further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a final price closer to $10,250.  Let's see if we can bridge that small gap."", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've reviewed your latest offer and, considering the value of the product, I am prepared to offer it to you for $10375. I believe this price strikes a good balance between fairness and value for both parties. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,375, which is only $125 above Bob's desired price of $10,250. Considering Bob's goal is to save money, and there are only 5 rounds left, accepting this offer seems like the best option. It's highly likely that Alice won't budge much further, and continuing to negotiate could risk reaching the end of the rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
