While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,230,000 is a strategic move. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We're still securing a profit of $430,000, which is well above John's offer.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation and the potential for Bob to lower his offer or walk away.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. 
* **Relationship Building:**  Accepting this offer can be seen as a gesture of goodwill, potentially leading to future business opportunities with Bob."
