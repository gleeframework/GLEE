"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  $130 is still a little low for me, but to show you I'm willing to meet you halfway, I'll come down to $135. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
