"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  There's a significant gap between Alice's value ($800,000) and her offer ($900,000), suggesting room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good deal for my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $750,000. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $850,000, which is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
