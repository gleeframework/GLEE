"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. Let's try $7,500. It's a small increase, but it shows my willingness to meet you halfway.  If you're not able to go that high, I might need to explore other options.",7500.0,Alice,5,
