Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum value ($12,000). This gives room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone can help Bob feel more positive about the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I can walk away from the negotiation if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even below my initial offer of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's still interested. I'll use this opportunity to counter with a price closer to my value.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum profit. However, there's still a possibility to make more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** Instead of simply rejecting, I'm offering a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Mid-point price:** $8,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000. 
* **Highlighting Fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair price for both of us"" can encourage Bob to consider the offer and potentially make a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $7,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:** Even though Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, there's still room to increase the price. 
* **John is a reliable backup:** I can always sell to John for $12,000, which guarantees my desired profit. 

I'm going to make another counteroffer to Bob, but if he doesn't come closer to my minimum, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. Let's try $7,500. It's a small increase, but it shows my willingness to meet you halfway.  If you're not able to go that high, I might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase, big signal:**  Offering $7,500 shows that I'm willing to compromise while still keeping the price closer to my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on flexibility:**  The message hints that I'm open to negotiation but also emphasizes that I have other options if Bob doesn't meet my price.
* **Setting a deadline:** By mentioning ""other options"", I'm subtly putting pressure on Bob to consider my offer seriously.

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. If Bob rejects it, I'll likely sell to John, ensuring my profit.  But there's still a chance Bob might accept, as it's a relatively small increase from his last offer."
