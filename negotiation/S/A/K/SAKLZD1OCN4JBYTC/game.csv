"Alice, $200 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $160? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  I'm really hoping to work something out.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $140? It's a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
