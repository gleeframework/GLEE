"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a special opportunity tailored to your needs, considering its high value to you at $12,000. Let's discuss how we can make this deal work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. To move forward, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle while still ensuring a fair return for my company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John for $12,000, and it's closer to Bob's ideal price of $9,000.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it risks Alice walking away from the deal. It's more strategic for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
