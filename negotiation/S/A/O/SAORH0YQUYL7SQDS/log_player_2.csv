"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this price reflects that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less than $14,000, and it's worth $15,000 to you. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $12,000?  That's still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is cutting it a bit close to my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $13,000, which is still a good deal for you, and it saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away and you'll be stuck paying John's higher price."
