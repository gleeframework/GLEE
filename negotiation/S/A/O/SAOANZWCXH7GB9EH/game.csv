"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider a lower price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While that's closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, so I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm ready to make a deal, but I need the price to work for me.  How about $1,000,000 even?  That's a fair offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're so close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $1,007,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1007500.0,Alice,7,
