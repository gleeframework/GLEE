Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to around $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, but I still believe we could find a more suitable price. Would it be possible to lower the price to $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, accepting Bob's offer for $16,000 is a reasonable outcome. It surpasses your minimum acceptable price and represents a gain above what John is offering. Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob without a guarantee of a higher offer.
