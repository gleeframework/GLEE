# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

* Accepting the offer is a good compromise that saves you a significant amount of money."
