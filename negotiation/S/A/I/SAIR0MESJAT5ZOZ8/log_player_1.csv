**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently decreasing his offer and seems unwilling to meet near my minimum price.  It's unlikely he'll dramatically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
