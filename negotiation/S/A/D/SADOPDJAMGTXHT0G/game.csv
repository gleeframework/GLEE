"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $130 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still quite low, and I know I could get more for it elsewhere. This is my final offer - $110.  Take it or leave it.",110.0,Alice,5,
