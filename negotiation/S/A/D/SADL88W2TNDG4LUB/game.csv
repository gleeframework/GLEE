"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $9,250 just isn't quite there for me.  How about $9,400? That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a chance to close this deal.",9400.0,Alice,5,
