Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $1,800,000. This reflects the real worth of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still too high for Bob.  He should reject the offer and continue to negotiate.  While Bob can buy from John for $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation with Alice to potentially get a better deal."

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant concession on my part while acknowledging the value you see in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,600,000 is still above Bob's preferred maximum of $1,200,000.  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob has the option of buying from John for a lower price if he can't get a better deal with Alice.  He should continue negotiating with Alice."
