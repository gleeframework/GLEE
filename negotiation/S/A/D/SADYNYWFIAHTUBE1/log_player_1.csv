"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression you believe the product is worth a significant amount. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""potential"" and ""value,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level. 
* **Leaving Room:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting at $2,000,000 allows for significant negotiation while staying well above our own minimum.
* **Alternative:**  We keep in mind John's standing offer of $1,500,000 as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly our minimum acceptable price. Accepting now would leave no room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer signals that we believe the product is worth more. It keeps the negotiation open and allows us to guide the price upwards. 
* **John as Backup:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While John's offer is appealing, there's potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $1,800,000. This reflects the real worth of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  We are moving down from our initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it gives us room for further negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Time Consideration:**  We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into a deal. We'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000,  which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Below John:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our minimum of $1,200,000, but still less than John's guaranteed $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiating Room:**  While tempting, we're still in early rounds. Rejecting shows we're aiming for a higher price and keeps Bob engaged.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Bob might walk away, but his incremental offers and willingness to ""find a solution"" suggest he's invested in the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant concession on my part while acknowledging the value you see in this product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  By stating this is our final offer, we aim to add weight to the negotiation and signal our commitment to this price point. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  We're coming down $200,000, a significant drop, to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet us closer to our price. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point of our negotiation rounds. Setting a firm stance now encourages a faster resolution.
* **Above John, Fair Deal:**  While $1,600,000 is still above John's offer, it represents a strong profit and a fair deal considering the value of the product to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm eager to close this deal, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 now matches John's standing offer. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or not reaching a significantly better price within the remaining rounds. 
* **Profitable Deal:** Accepting $1,500,000 still yields a substantial profit, even though it's slightly below our initial target. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows us to reinvest the proceeds sooner."
