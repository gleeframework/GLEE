"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if I can get a good price before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $10 less than my initial asking price, but it's still above my minimum value of $80. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
