"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,250,000? This price is still very fair, considering the product's potential benefits to your business.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? ",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're close to an agreement.  However, $1,125,000 still falls short of the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  Would you consider $1,187,500?  This price reflects a compromise and leaves room for both of us to feel comfortable with the deal.",1187500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000 as our final price?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
