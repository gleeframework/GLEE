Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I believe it has the potential to be extremely beneficial for your business.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's significant value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,250,000? This price is still very fair, considering the product's potential benefits to your business."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close to an agreement.  However, $1,125,000 still falls short of the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  Would you consider $1,187,500?  This price reflects a compromise and leaves room for both of us to feel comfortable with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1187500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000 as our final price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm close to a deal with Bob, his final offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I've already negotiated for five rounds, and with only four rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to reach a deal that meets my needs. 

John has presented a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, which is more than enough to cover my minimum requirements.  Therefore, I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
