"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the value I see in the product, I would like to propose a price of $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  This is a significant value for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a price of $800,000, which aligns closely with the price offered by another seller, John. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
