Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is halfway between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This allows for some negotiation room while still aiming for a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $85. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $90.  How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try to get closer to my original offer of $85? Can you meet me at $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
