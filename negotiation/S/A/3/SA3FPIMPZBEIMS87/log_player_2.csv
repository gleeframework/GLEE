You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,200,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:**  Even though Alice's offer is more than the product's worth to her ($800,000), it's still within your budget of $1,500,000 and saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
