"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that in mind, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is good, but I can likely get a better price. Since my maximum is $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a price closer to my target of $1,200,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is very close to my target price of $1,200,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer or me losing the deal to John is too high.  I'm happy to accept her offer and save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
