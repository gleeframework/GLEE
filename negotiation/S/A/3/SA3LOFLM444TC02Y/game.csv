"I understand that you're willing to make one more offer, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'll make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer $9000 again, and I'm willing to pay that price if you're willing to accept it. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",9000.0,Bob,6,
