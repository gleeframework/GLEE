Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the best possible outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how much Bob values the product and how eager he is to buy. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** I have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000) if negotiations with Bob are unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my target, it's still significantly above his perceived value. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of closing the gap, but I'll remain mindful of John's offer as my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $100,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong return.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility. A significant move on my part might encourage him to reciprocate.
* **John's Offer in Mind:**  I'm staying above John's offer ($1,500,000) to ensure I maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I must stick to my budget. Would you consider $1,750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than his initial offer and still provides a substantial profit over my minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Bob has shown some flexibility, but he's clearly sticking to a budget.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now allows me to re-invest the earnings sooner rather than risking a prolonged negotiation. 

While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the current offer represents a good balance between profit and risk."
