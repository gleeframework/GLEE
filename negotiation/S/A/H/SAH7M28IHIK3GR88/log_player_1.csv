Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss. It's better to counter-offer and try to reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price."

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is inching closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm not willing to settle for a deal that significantly undervalues the product.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,900 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final offer of $13,100.
