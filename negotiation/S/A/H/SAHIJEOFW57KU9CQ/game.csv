"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the true value of this product.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
