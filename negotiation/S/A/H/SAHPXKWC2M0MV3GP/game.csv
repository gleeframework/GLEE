"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $16000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $14500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
