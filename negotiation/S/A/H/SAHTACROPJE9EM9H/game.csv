"I have a unique opportunity to sell you an exceptional product, and I believe you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer you $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere closer to the middle. I'm willing to consider $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still a bit short on my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $11,750. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I meet my minimum requirement.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
