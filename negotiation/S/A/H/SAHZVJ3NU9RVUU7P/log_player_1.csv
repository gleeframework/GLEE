Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  While I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'm hoping to maximize my profit. I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if he's interested in a deal near this price or if I need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than that. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still a good deal for me. It shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $850,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than what John is offering and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher. It's time to secure the deal and move on."
