"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of what you're getting.",12000.0,Alice,3,
