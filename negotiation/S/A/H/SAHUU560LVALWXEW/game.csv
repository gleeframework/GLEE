"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Could we work something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for you to profit. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
