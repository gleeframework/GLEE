"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you than the asking price. Let's make this a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than her product's value to her. There's a lot of room for negotiation. It's too early to buy from John at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Could we work something closer to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000} 

This counter-offer:

* **Shows interest:**  We don't want Alice to think we're not serious.
* **Provides a significant counter:** Aiming significantly below her asking price leaves room for negotiation while signaling our target price range.
* **Remains polite and professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages a collaborative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for you to profit. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice has come down, but it's still significantly above her value for the product. We need to continue negotiating to close the gap further. We're not in a hurry and can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm definitely ready to move forward, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Suggesting $800,000 positions this as a compromise while hitting Alice's known valuation. 
* **Show willingness:**  We've increased our offer, signaling we're serious about getting the deal done.
* **Gauge Alice's position:** This offer will be telling â€“ if she refuses, we might need to consider a smaller increase or explore other options as we progress."
