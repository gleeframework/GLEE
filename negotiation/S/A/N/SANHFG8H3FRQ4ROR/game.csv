"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $900000. Would you be open to discussing that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $900000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $1000000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
