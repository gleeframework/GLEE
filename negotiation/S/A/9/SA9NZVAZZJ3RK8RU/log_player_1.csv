Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a good profit. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value ($80), but not ridiculously so. There's a chance he might find it acceptable, especially if you present the product's benefits well."
