I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm not going to settle for anything less than $10,000 at this point."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, the negotiations have reached a stalemate, and I'm concerned I might not be able to get a better offer from him within the remaining rounds.  It's best to secure the sale with John and ensure I get at least my minimum asking price."
