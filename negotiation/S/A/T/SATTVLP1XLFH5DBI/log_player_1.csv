"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet satisfied. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,500,000 with further negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to show good faith, but still aiming for a price closer to my target.  This is a good compromise, and I believe Bob will be more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to accept yet. There's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get a price closer to my target.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

This is my final offer. I'm willing to accept my minimum price to ensure a deal with Bob.  He knows the product is valuable to him, and I'm confident he'll see the value in accepting my offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time and negotiation rounds.  I've already made my final offer, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
