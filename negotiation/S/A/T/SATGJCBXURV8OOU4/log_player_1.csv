Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm getting more than my minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay more, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's a strong starting point:** I'm showing confidence in the product's value.

I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option, which gives me leverage in case Bob is unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $12,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above my minimum:**  I'm still getting more than my minimum of $10,000.
* **Shows I'm willing to negotiate:** It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying close to my desired price point.
* **Leaves room for further discussion:**  There's still some space for Bob to negotiate if he's truly interested.

I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm confident I can strike a better deal with Bob."
