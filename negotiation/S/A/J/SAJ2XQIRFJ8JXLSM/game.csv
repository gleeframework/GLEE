"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider $90, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle at $82.5? That's a fair deal for both of us.",82.5,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as close as I can get to your last offer. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,7,
