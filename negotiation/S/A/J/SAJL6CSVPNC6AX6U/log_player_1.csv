Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and positive, aiming to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I'm willing to discuss the price, making Bob feel like he has some control in the negotiation. 

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the desire to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob or at least get closer to my desired price point.  Selling to John right now would mean leaving money on the table, and I'm not ready to do that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,500,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,650,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and positive, aiming to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I frame my offer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Clarity:** I clearly state my counteroffer price for Bob's understanding.

This approach demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1650000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $1550000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit low. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I'm confident that I can get a better price.  Selling to John right now would mean accepting a price that's significantly below my desired profit margin, and I'm not ready to do that yet. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can close the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,550,000.  How about we try $1,600,000? It's a small step up, but it shows my willingness to compromise while getting closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing the price by a smaller amount than before to show flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I reiterate that my offer is a compromise, showing that I'm working towards a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintain My Position:** The message subtly reinforces my desire to get closer to my desired price point.

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a firm but reasonable bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already offered $1550000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. That's my final offer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go any higher. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get closer to my desired price with Bob, it's clear that we're at an impasse. Continuing to negotiate would be unproductive and could risk losing both Bob and John as potential buyers. Accepting John's offer ensures a sale at a price that meets my minimum threshold, guaranteeing a profit.  

While I would have preferred a higher price, it's better to secure a deal and move on than to risk getting stuck in a stalemate."
