# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $18,000. This is a significant markup.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $16,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's work towards an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

While $15,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to pay more than $14,000. I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
