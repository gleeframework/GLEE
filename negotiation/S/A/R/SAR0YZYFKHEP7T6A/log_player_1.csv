Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is above Bob's valuation of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a profit.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* **John as a fallback:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option to ensure I get at least my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting slightly higher than Bob's valuation, I aim to get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can adjust my price based on Bob's response and potential counteroffers. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  A friendly approach and a clear offer will encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $1,000,000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer to meet this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls significantly short of my desired price. Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is more than double Bob's offer. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting, I show Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Explore a counteroffer:** I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, potentially reaching a compromise.
* **Secure the best deal:**  I can still sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,000,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Empathy and Reasoning:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints and provide a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing fairness for both parties.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to continue the conversation and potentially reach an agreement.

This approach aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** The counteroffer offers a reasonable compromise that could appeal to Bob.
* **Show commitment:** It demonstrates my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintain control:** By rejecting Bob's initial offer and making a counteroffer, I retain control of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe $1,050,000 would be the most I could reasonably offer while still ensuring I can afford the product without straining my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $1,050,000 still falls short.  John's offer of $1,200,000 guarantees me a significantly better return.  

* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiations that might not result in a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Maximizing profit:**  John's offer secures the highest possible price, ensuring I achieve my financial goals.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting John's offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly and avoid further rounds of negotiation.

Considering the potential for further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a significantly higher price, and the risk of a stalemate, I am choosing to sell to John for the highest guaranteed return."
