"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $1,000,000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer to meet this price point?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
