"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $162.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",162.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $157.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",157.5,Alice,5,
