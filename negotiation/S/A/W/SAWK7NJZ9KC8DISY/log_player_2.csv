"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a price closer to Alice's value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but higher than her product value. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Target Price:** My goal is to buy the product for under $100, ideally closer to $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested! $85 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $92.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more flexibility. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met me in the middle, $92.50 is still significantly higher than her $80 value. This suggests there's room to negotiate further. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the option to buy from John for $120, so I'm not desperate to accept a price that's not advantageous. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, I can gauge Alice's willingness to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we settle at $90?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** I'm continuing to negotiate in smaller increments to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit while still trying to reach a more favorable price.
* **Seeking Compromise:** By suggesting a specific price, I'm showing willingness to compromise and find a middle ground. 
* **Time Consideration:**  Each round takes time. I'm balancing potential savings against the risk that Alice might not go much lower."
