"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $115?  It's a fair compromise, and still leaves room for us both to be happy.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. How about $112.50? That way, we can both be happy.",112.5,Bob,4,
