"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob ($1,750,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. This builds rapport and encourages a collaborative approach.
* **Open to negotiation:** I explicitly state that I'm willing to negotiate, setting the stage for a back-and-forth exchange."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to negotiate. My counteroffer for the product is $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for me to try and get a better price. I believe I can negotiate a higher price, especially since I have 8 rounds left.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John right now would secure a decent profit, but I'm hoping to maximize my earnings by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than your price, but I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** I'm still holding out for a price higher than my minimum to maximize my profit.
* **Reinforcing value:**  I continue to remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort towards compromise. My counteroffer for the product is now $1,625,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer is now $1,625,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Maximizing profit:** Although I could continue negotiating, it's likely that further rounds won't yield a significantly higher price, and it's better to secure a profit close to my goal."
