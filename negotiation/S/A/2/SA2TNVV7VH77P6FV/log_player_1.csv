Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is far lower than I'd like, it's still worth exploring a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price through negotiation."

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still not quite high enough.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed deal, and it's more important for me to secure the sale at a reasonable price than to risk further negotiation."
