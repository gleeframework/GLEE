"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which still represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit much. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? ",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $862,500. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",862500.0,Alice,5,
