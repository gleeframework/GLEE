"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a deal that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $825,000. It's a good deal for both of us and allows us to make this transaction happen.",825000.0,Bob,4,
