Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $750,000 is still a decent profit,  I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a better agreement."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's slightly less than my initial asking price, but it's still above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and close to the value of the product for Bob.  I'll accept his offer and move forward with the transaction."
