"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price.
