Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe this price reflects the value it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for the highest price Bob might accept to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Above John's Offer:**  Ensure the price is attractive enough that you don't default to John's $12,000 offer.

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale above your minimum acceptable price."
