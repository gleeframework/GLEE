"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your initial price, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $875,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'll meet you at $920,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $920,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $890,000 for the product. I believe this represents a fair and mutually beneficial price, given our previous offers. It would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the outcome. What are your thoughts?",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. However, $890,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'll make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $915,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",915000.0,Alice,7,
