"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $875,000.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $875,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be sure this deal makes financial sense for me as well.  Let's settle this right now. If you agree to $850,000, we have a deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
