Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [Product Name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what [Product Name] can offer you. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher.  $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is polite and open to discussion, signaling that you're willing to negotiate to some extent.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might lower the initial offer slightly.
* **Market context:**  Understanding the overall market for similar products can inform your pricing strategy. 

This offer balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
