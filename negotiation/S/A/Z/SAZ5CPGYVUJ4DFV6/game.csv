"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

This allows you to stay within your budget while still getting a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
