{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is significantly more than my minimum value but also leaves room for negotiation. I am confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, giving me the chance to reach a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is still below my desired value. I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
