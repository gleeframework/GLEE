"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I believe $1,200,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, I'm still only comfortable with $1,100,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value you've stated and the price John is offering. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
