Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to John's price, it's still more expensive.  At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price significantly better than John's offer of $800,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the best known price."
