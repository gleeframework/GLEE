"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I believe it's a sweet spot for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but $700,000 is still a bit short for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
