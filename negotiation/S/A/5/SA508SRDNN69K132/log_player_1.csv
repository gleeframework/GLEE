"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Targetting the middle:**  $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum ($800,000). This increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm leaving enough space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I'm hoping to achieve a profitable outcome while still being open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer, but still above my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is closer to my desired outcome than $800,000, but it's still below my initial asking price.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have multiple rounds left, giving me the opportunity to push for a more favorable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's flexibility and see if he's willing to come up slightly from his initial offer.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $1,150,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell myself short.

By meeting halfway, I'm hoping to find a mutually agreeable price point and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches my counteroffer:**  This means we've reached a point of agreement, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already on round 4, and each round brings me closer to needing to sell to John for a significantly lower price. 
* **Securing a good price:** $1,150,000 is a solid price that's above my minimum and within my target range.

While I'd ideally like to earn even more, accepting this offer ensures I get a good deal without risking losing the deal entirely."
