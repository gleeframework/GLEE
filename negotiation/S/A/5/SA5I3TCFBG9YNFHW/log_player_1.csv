{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately risking selling to John for the lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's better than his initial offer, but not worth risking further negotiation.  I'll sell to John for $150 to guarantee my minimum profit."
