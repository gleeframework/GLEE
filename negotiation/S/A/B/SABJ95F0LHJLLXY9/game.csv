"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't afford $18,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is too low for me. Could you do $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $16,500 is a bit out of my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $15,750?",15750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $15,750 is close, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this to make sense.  Does that work for you?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your patience and understanding. I've considered your proposal, and I believe we could find a mutually beneficial solution. How about $15,500 for the product?",15500.0,Bob,6,
