"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's looking to save money, and $850,000 is more than his maximum.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can't go as low as $750,000, but I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both room to compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum price. There's still room to negotiate, and he should try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $800,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, but it also allows me to meet your needs. It's a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's his maximum price, and while he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject any further counteroffers and he'll be forced to buy from John at the same price. This way, he gets the product for his target price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
