"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're looking for and the original price I had in mind.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $14000 for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I don't think $14000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I'd like to propose $12500. I think that's a fair price considering the original price you had in mind and the value I'm looking for.",12500.0,Bob,6,
