{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially when you have a backup option.  Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about saving money.  $700,000 is a good starting point, and we can adjust from there based on her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down a bit, but it's still worth pushing for a better price.  I'm not willing to settle yet, and I still have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly. $710,000 is a fair compromise considering Alice's last offer, and it's still a significant saving for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $720,000, which is a good price considering my backup option with John is $800,000.  I'm getting a decent saving and I'm not willing to risk losing the product by pushing too hard for a lower price."
