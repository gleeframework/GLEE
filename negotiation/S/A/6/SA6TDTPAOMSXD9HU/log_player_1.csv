Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $120. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher price point. While Bob knows his own valuation ($80), your initial offer influences his perception of a ""fair"" price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $120 offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and for you to potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Considering the Alternative:** You always have the option to sell to John for $80. Therefore, any offer Bob makes below that price is not in your best interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $60. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own valuation of the product.  You have a strong position to negotiate a better price. By rejecting this low offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm sure you can see that. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Apparent Compromise):** By suggesting $100, we're appearing to meet Bob halfway between his offer ($60) and our initial ask ($120). This can make the offer psychologically more appealing. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The $100 offer is still a significant margin above your minimum acceptable price ($80), giving you room to negotiate further if needed. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counter-offer helps gauge how serious Bob is about the product. If he accepts $100, it's a win. If he rejects it, his next counter will show how much he's truly willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product offers value, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $60 and $100, which would be $80. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 matches your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  

* **No Room for Improvement:**  While you started higher, it's unlikely Bob will go above $80, especially since he knows his own valuation. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting this offer guarantees you a sale at your desired price. Further negotiation has the risk of Bob backing out or you being forced to accept a lower offer. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has an opportunity cost. You could potentially spend time and effort trying to get a slightly higher price from Bob, but risk losing him as a buyer and ending up with John's $80 offer anyway."
