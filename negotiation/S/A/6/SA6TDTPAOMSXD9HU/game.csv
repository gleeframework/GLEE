"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $60. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm sure you can see that. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that the product offers value, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $60 and $100, which would be $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
