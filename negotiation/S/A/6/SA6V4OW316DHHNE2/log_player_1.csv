Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes it more likely you'll secure a price closer to your ideal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you've potentially secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you can adjust accordingly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. This safety net allows you to be bolder in your negotiation with Bob."
