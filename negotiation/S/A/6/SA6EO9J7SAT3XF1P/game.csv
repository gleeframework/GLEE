"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we've discussed, this product is worth a significant amount to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. With that in mind, I'm willing to reduce the price to $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $825000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value of similar products.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I'm getting a decent return on my investment. With that in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
