"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's priced at $110, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $100 either. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and $95 is a good offer.  However, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference at $97.50?  This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92.50, which is the lowest I can go. Can you consider that?",92.5,Bob,6,
