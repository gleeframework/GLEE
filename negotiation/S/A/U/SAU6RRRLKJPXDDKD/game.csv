"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $950000 is significantly below the value I place on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
