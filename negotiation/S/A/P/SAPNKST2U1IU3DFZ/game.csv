"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, however, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my end and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
