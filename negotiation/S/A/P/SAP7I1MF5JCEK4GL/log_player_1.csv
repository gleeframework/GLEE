"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is a bold move, but I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer. I'm hoping to entice Bob to negotiate and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept just yet.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,550,000.  This is still a good deal for me, and I believe it's a fair price for Bob as well.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is still lower than what I ideally want, it's a good offer considering Bob's initial stance. Accepting this means a quicker deal and a decent profit. There's always a risk of negotiations breaking down and me having to settle with John's offer, which is a little lower than what I'd like.  I'm going to take this offer and secure the deal."
