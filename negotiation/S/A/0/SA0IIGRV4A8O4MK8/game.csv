"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your value. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $100 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100, as I'm sure you can see that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to take it.",100.0,Bob,4,
