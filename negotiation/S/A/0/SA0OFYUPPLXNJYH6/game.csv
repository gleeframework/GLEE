"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. While I cannot disclose the exact details at this time, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1500000 to me. I'm confident it will be even more valuable to the right buyer. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time opportunity, so please consider it carefully. If you decline, I will be selling it to another interested party. ",2000000.0,Alice,1,
