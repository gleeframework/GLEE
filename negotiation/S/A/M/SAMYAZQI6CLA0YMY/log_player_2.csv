"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is a special offer tailored for valued individuals like yourself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is quite high ($95) considering the product's worth to her ($80) and your maximum budget ($100). There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** By offering $70, we're starting significantly below Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the likelihood of getting a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while also clearly stating our price limit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for a potential compromise somewhere between $70 and $95."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer at $85 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, $85 is still significantly higher than our target. There's room for further negotiation. We're getting closer to John's price ($100), but it's worth trying one more time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price directly in between Alice's last offer ($85) and our previous counteroffer ($70). This common negotiation tactic can signal a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Pressure Point:**  We're getting closer to John's alternative price of $100. By offering $78, we're subtly reminding Alice that we have other options without directly threatening to walk away. 
* **Seeking Resolution:** The tone remains polite and solution-oriented, aiming to encourage Alice to accept and finalize the deal."
