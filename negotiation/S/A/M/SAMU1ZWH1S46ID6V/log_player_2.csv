"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum price, you can likely get a better deal.
* **You have room to negotiate.**  There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price ($1,200,000) and your maximum ($1,500,000). 
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  You're not desperate, and having John as a backup gives you leverage.

By rejecting the offer, you can start a counteroffer process, aiming to lower the price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  It's closer to your maximum, but you can likely still get a better price.
* **You have room to negotiate further.** There's still a significant gap between her offer ($1,100,000) and your maximum ($1,500,000).
* **Buying from John is a backup:** You're in a good position to continue negotiating and avoid having to pay John's higher price.

By rejecting the offer, you can continue the negotiation and try to get the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.**  You were aiming for $1,000,000, and she's come down to $1,050,000.
* **It's a fair deal.**  You're still getting the product for significantly less than John's price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price, and you could end up paying John's price if you reject her offer.

Considering the risk of further negotiation and the fact that this offer is close to your target, it's a good idea to accept and finalize the deal."
