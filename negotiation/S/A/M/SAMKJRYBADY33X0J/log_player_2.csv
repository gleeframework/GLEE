It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. $950,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."

Alice is still too high. You can likely get it for lower. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if she'll budge further."

Alice has come down significantly, and you're getting a good deal at $885,000. It's worth accepting the offer and saving $115,000 compared to buying from John."
