"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit for me. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial price,  $9,000 is a good deal for me.  I've already learned that Bob is willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
