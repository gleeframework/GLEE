"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's a chance Bob can get it even lower. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate seriously and potentially pushes Alice to consider a lower price.  He's still within his budget, leaving room for further negotiations if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate. Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, and Bob can potentially get a lower price by making another counteroffer.  He wants to explore further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he is serious about buying the product but still aiming for a better price. He's splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, hoping to find a middle ground. He is also keeping in mind his maximum budget of $15,000 and doesn't want to risk going too high too soon."
