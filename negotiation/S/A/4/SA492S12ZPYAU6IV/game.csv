"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  You know the value of this product, and I'm confident you'll see this as a good investment. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay my asking price.  Let me know your decision.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
