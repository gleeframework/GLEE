"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering our mutual interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This offer is too good to be true!  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves me with a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly lower than what I'd pay John, and it gets me the product."
