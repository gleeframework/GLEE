"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd pay elsewhere and still leaves you with a healthy profit.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves me with a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"
