"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, and I can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  There's also the safety net of buying from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to let it go for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still above my target price. I want to keep pushing for a lower price and see if I can reach an agreement closer to my counteroffer of $850,000.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal with a bit more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This offer is reasonable, considering the value for both of us, and it would bring us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm offering it to you for $885,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is within my acceptable range and significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. This offer represents a good compromise, and accepting it is the most logical choice."
