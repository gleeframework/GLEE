"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and other similar products.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think a price of $1200000 is more reasonable. I'm willing to compromise and pay $1225000. What do you think?",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $1350000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm thinking of $1275000. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop. I've already offered you a price of $1275000, and you're going back to $1225000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm thinking of $1300000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to make a small compromise, but I think a price of $1250000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the best I can do.

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I've already offered you $1275000, $1300000, and now you're offering $1250000. I'm not willing to go below $1300000. I'm afraid I'll have to draw a line here. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to make one last attempt to compromise. I'm willing to pay $1265000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000.
