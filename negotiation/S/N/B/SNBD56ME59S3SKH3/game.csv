"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm aiming to save even more.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I'm confident it's a win-win deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
