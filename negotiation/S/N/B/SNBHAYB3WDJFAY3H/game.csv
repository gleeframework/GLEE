"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $5500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $5500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",6000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $6000.  How about we split the difference and go with $5750?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",5750.0,Bob,4,
