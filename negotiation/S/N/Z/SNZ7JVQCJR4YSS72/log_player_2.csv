"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know you're looking for something like this, and I believe it would be worth at least $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and more than what I would get selling it to someone else. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
