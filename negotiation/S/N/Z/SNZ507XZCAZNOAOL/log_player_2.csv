Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

While Alice has come down, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Let's close this deal at this price, it's a fair compromise and allows me to move forward with the purchase. "", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised by coming down from $1,200,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

```

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is closer to my budget, but it's still higher than what I'm comfortable spending.  At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer of $800,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant saving compared to Alice's final offer."
