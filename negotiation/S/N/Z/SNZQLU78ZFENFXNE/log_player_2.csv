(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but you might be able to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and how much she values the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down in price, but I still believe there's room for a better deal. I'll counter again to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product while still keeping the price below my maximum. This should hopefully lead to a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $725,000 is closer to my maximum, I'm still not ready to accept. We're in the middle ground now, so I want to see if I can get Alice to come down just a little more before I consider accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm raising my offer again, but this time I'm only going up by $25,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal but that I'm also willing to walk away if she's not willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice is back to her original offer of $750,000.  We've been going back and forth, and while I'd love to get it lower, I'm getting close to my maximum and the risk of losing this deal increases with each round. It's time to accept and secure the product."
