Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000.  I'm hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than my minimum of $10,000, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still higher than my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better offer in the next round.  I'm happy to take $9,600 and move on."
