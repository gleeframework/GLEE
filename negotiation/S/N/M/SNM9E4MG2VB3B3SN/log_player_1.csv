Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is too low, and I can get $8,000 from John. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I need.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop my price to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my asking price, it's still below what I need. I'll try to get a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a good compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
