Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering the product at $100 splits the difference between Bob's valuation and your minimum price. This maximizes your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that's likely attractive to him. 

**Why not ask for more?**

While you could try asking for a higher price, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If Bob rejects, you're left with your backup offer of $80 from John, which is less profitable."
