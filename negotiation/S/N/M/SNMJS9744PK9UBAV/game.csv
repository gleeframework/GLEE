"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $13,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you consider something closer to $9,000? I'm serious about buying, but I need to be mindful of my spending.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain from the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $9,500?  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",9500.0,Bob,6,
