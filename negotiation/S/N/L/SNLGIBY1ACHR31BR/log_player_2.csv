"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119.  I think it's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, it's still above what the product is worth to you.  You can get a slightly better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.  

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes that John's offer of $120 is guaranteed and you can be certain of purchasing from him."
