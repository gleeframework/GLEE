"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $110?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $120. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll go with John's deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $125. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we meet you halfway between $120 and $125 at $122.50?",122.5,Alice,5,
