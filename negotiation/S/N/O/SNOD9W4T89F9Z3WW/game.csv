,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern, Bob. However, I think the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $130? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $125? It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",125.0,Alice,5,
