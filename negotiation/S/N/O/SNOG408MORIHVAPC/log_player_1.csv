Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $1,000,000, so $1,200,000 is within a reasonable range.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is straightforward, focusing on the offer and inviting a response. 

By starting with this offer, you're establishing a baseline and allowing for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay up to $1100000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to your minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below your desired price.  It's more advantageous to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's room for him to raise his offer.  Selling to John would secure a higher price but would end the negotiation prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I can't accept $1,100,000.  The product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** You're demonstrating flexibility by coming down from your original price.
* **Justification:** You're providing a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the product's value and suggesting a win-win situation.
* **Clear next step:** You're asking for Bob's decision, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1125000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,125,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still too low to be a good deal for you.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can push Bob further towards your minimum.  Selling to John would guarantee a better price, but it eliminates the opportunity to potentially reach a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,125,000 is still below the true value of the product.  I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $1,140,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the fair value of the product. Let me know if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1140000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** You're demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Final Offer:** This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Fair Value:** You're reiterating the product's worth while justifying your offer.

By making this counteroffer, you're aiming to get as close to your desired price as possible while maintaining the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to pay $1137500 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,137,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,137,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,137,500 is still significantly lower than your minimum price of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price that meets your requirements.  Selling to John guarantees you the full value of the product and eliminates the risk of further negotiations."
