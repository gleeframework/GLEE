"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,800 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my previous offer. How about $10,150? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this is a deal that benefits both of us.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",9500.0,Bob,6,
