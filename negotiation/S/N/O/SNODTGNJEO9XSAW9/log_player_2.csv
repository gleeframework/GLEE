# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can save more money by rejecting it. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, or you can proceed to purchase from John."
