"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for this product. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're making progress, but $1,250,000 is still too low. I'll hold firm in the next round and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe my previous offer of $1,350,000 is already a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of this product. I'm willing to stand by that price. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're standing firm on your price, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for this product. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,280,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is getting closer, and while I'd prefer to get closer to $1.35 million, $1,280,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away entirely."
