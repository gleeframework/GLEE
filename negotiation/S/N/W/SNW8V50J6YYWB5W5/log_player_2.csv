"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* While rejecting Alice's offer means buying from John for a higher price, it's still the best option since it saves you $200,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
