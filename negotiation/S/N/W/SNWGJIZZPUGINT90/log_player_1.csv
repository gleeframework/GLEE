"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're serious about selling and sets the tone for a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

* **Rejecting the offer** allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price. 
* **Selling to John** guarantees you your minimum, but it's a missed opportunity to potentially get more from Bob.

You'll need to analyze Bob's behavior and adjust your counter-offer strategy in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850,000 is too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $950,000? This is a fair compromise, and gives you a significant discount."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** The offer is closer to Bob's offer but still above your desired minimum. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning with Bob:** The message explains the reasoning behind the price and offers a ""fair compromise"" framing.
* **Setting a clear expectation:**  This counteroffer establishes $950,000 as your firm price point.

By maintaining a firm stance while showing flexibility, you can keep the negotiation moving forward and potentially reach a deal closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. You've already moved significantly from your initial offer of $1,000,000 and you still have room to negotiate with Bob. 

* **Rejecting the offer** keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get a better price. 
* **Selling to John** is a safe option, but it would mean forgoing the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price from Bob.

You need to carefully consider Bob's persistence in making offers closer to your desired price.  In the next round, you'll need to decide whether to meet Bob halfway or hold firm to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $920,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need to stay above $930,000 to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $935,000 as a final compromise.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show progress:** Acknowledge Bob's willingness to negotiate and demonstrate that you're making progress.
* **Stay above your minimum:** Keep your price above $930,000 while inching closer to Bob's offers.
* **Final compromise framing:**  Presenting this offer as a ""final compromise"" creates pressure on Bob to accept.

This strategy is designed to  increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. However, if he rejects it, you'll have to decide in the next round whether to stand firm or to risk a lower price to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to save some more. I'm willing to pay $915000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer of $915,000 is getting very close to your previous counteroffer of $935,000, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. You've already made significant concessions and there are still a few rounds left.

* **Rejecting the offer** allows you to maintain your position and potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **Selling to John** is a safe option, but it would mean missing out on the possibility of getting closer to your desired price with Bob.

You need to carefully analyze Bob's behavior and adjust your counter-offer strategy in the next round. Consider whether to:

* **Stand firm:**  Hold onto your previous offer and see if Bob will come up to meet you. 
* **Make a small concession:**  Offer a slightly lower price to see if you can close the deal.
* **Sell to John:**  If you think Bob won't budge and you're getting close to the end of the negotiation, selling to John might be the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really close to accepting your offer, but I need to stay above $910,000 to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $912,000 as a final compromise.  This is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 912000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show urgency:**  Emphasize that you're close to accepting but still need a slightly higher price. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Final compromise:**  Framing this as a ""final compromise"" puts pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Small concession:** This offer is a small concession from your previous counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Maintain minimum:** This offer is still above your desired minimum of $910,000, ensuring you don't accept a deal below your target.

With only three rounds left, this strategy aims to tempt Bob into accepting your final offer while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, you'll need to decide in the next round whether to stand firm, make a final concession, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to save some more. I'm willing to pay $905000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $905,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $905,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting your desired price from Bob is increasing. While $905,000 is closer to your minimum than before, it's still below your target. Additionally, Bob's consistent insistence on getting a lower price suggests he might not be willing to meet you in the middle.

**Selling to John** guarantees you your desired price of $1,200,000.  This eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures a secure deal.  

While you might be able to get a slightly higher price by continuing with Bob, the potential loss outweighs the potential gain. It's better to take the guaranteed profit from John and move on."
