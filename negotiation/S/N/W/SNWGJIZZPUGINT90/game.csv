"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850000 is too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $950000? This is a fair compromise, and gives you a significant discount.",950000.0,Alice,3,
