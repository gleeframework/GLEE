{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a relatively high price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also tries to build rapport by suggesting that Bob would appreciate the product's value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk Tolerance:**  Are you more comfortable with a quick sale at a lower price or are you willing to risk losing the sale to John in order to try and get a higher price? 
* **Bob's Information:**  Do you have any information about Bob's financial situation or how much he might value the product? 
* **Negotiation Style:**  Are you comfortable with aggressive bargaining or do you prefer a more collaborative approach? 

This offer is just a starting point.  Your next moves will depend on Bob's response and your understanding of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum acceptable for you, there is room for negotiation. You know the product is worth more than $15,000, so you're not willing to accept his offer just yet. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $15,000 but lower than $20,000. Consider factors like:

* **Your Negotiation Style:** How willing are you to compromise?
* **Bob's Financial Situation:** Do you think he might be willing to pay more?

You can use a counteroffer to bridge the gap between your two initial offers and see if you can reach an agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This would still be a good price for me, and it would allow us to both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** It's a compromise between your original offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Maintain some profit:** It still allows you to earn more than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Use persuasive language:** The message emphasizes that this offer is a win-win situation for both of you.

**Remember:** This counteroffer is just a suggestion. You can adjust the price based on your assessment of Bob's financial situation and your negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $15000. How about $16250? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,250 is a good compromise, and it's closer to your desired price than John's offer of $15,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance you might not get a higher price, and you could risk losing the sale entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John."
