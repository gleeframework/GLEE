"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me at that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? This would still be a good price for me, and it would allow us to both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $15000. How about $16250? That's the highest I can go.",16250.0,Bob,4,
