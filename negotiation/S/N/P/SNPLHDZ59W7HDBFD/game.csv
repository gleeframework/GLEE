"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offers. Would you be willing to consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
