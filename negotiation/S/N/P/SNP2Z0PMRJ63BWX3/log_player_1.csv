Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This is a generous offer, reflecting my desire to find a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I could go up to $950,000.  That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested but moving slowly.  We need to signal some flexibility but staying above our minimum price is crucial.  We'll make another counteroffer, inching closer but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,350,000?  That's a substantial reduction on my part, and it reflects my willingness to make a deal happen."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need to see a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob stating  ""$1,050,000 is my final offer"" could be a bluff. We are only $50,000 away from our minimum.  It's worth seeing if he'll budge a bit more in the next round.  The risk is he walks away, but we're prepared to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a suitable agreement, and I've tried to show my willingness to negotiate. To be frank, I need to get at least $1,200,000 for this. So, let's wrap this up.  If this works for you, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1200000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are at a critical point. By stating our minimum acceptable price directly and firmly, we give Bob a final chance while also preparing him for the possibility of walking away. This approach aims to close the deal quickly and avoid further back-and-forth."
