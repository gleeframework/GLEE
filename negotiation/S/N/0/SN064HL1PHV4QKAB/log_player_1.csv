Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $100 would be a fair price for both of us. Could we meet at that point?

Bob is holding firm at $100, and it's unlikely he'll go any higher.  Since John offers a guaranteed $100, it's time to cut negotiations with Bob and take the sure sale."
