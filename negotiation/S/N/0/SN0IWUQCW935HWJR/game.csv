"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $725,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product, while still allowing for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $712,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",712500.0,Alice,5,
