The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob.  Alice's offer is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal. He's offering $750,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's original price.  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. While buying from John at $800,000 is an option, Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, as there is still a chance to get a better deal."

Bob is willing to pay his maximum value for the product.  This is a strong counteroffer, as it signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't go higher."
