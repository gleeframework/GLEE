I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still within the negotiation rounds and have a chance to get a better price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

We've reached round 6, and Bob's offer is still below my desired price point. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better deal.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
