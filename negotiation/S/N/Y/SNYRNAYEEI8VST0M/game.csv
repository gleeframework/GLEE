"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you trying to work with me.  However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good price for you given your desired selling price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  It's closer to my desired price and a fair price for such a great product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
