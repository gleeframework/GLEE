"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

You can definitely do better than $9,500.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you trying to work with me.  However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good price for you given your desired selling price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  It's closer to my desired price and a fair price for such a great product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate further, $9,000 is a good deal.  It's lower than Alice's initial offer, and it's only $1,000 more than John's offer.  It's worth taking this deal and avoiding any further negotiation."
