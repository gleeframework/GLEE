"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This shows I'm open to negotiation while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $2.50 below my target price and he seems motivated to close the deal. Accepting his offer is the best strategy in this round, maximizing my earnings and avoiding further negotiation risk."
