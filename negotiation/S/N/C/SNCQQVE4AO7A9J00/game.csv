"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, but $105 is still a bit below my minimum. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $110?  That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $112, but that's as high as I can go.",112.0,Alice,7,
