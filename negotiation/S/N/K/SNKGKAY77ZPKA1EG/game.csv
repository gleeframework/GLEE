"While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about we try $950,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1,000,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
