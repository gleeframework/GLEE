"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to counter with a lower price, potentially saving yourself some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's getting closer. You're aiming for the lowest possible price, and rejecting this offer gives you another chance to make a counteroffer. It's possible that you can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you initially wanted, but it's getting closer to your desired price. It's a fair compromise that saves you $25,000 compared to buying from John.  Since it's her final offer, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price if you reject it.  You're likely to save more time and effort by accepting this offer."
