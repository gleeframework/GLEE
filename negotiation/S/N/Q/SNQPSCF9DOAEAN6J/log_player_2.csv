"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $13,500 is still too high for him, even though it's less than John's price.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I see the value in this product, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This feels like a fair deal considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,750 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit high for Bob. He should continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,750 is still a little too high for my budget. Let's meet at $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've been great to negotiate with. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected offers at $13,500, $11,750, and $11,000.  Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Bob has a few options:

* **Accept:**  $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's $15,000. He's saving a significant amount of money.
* **Reject:** There's a risk that Alice will walk away, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Counter Offer:**  It's unlikely Alice will change her mind at this point. 

Since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, accepting the offer is the most logical choice in this round."
