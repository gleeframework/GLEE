"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $155. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll offer it to you for $145. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $140. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",140.0,Alice,7,
