"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using a question to encourage Bob to respond and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum value:** While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below what I consider the product's worth. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's room for negotiation and Bob might be willing to go higher, especially since he's already expressed interest. 
* **Avoiding a ""Quick Sell"":**  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a safe option, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to fairly compensate for the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and emphasizing the potential value he'll get at this price.
* **Asking for Feedback:** I'm using a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $850000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it would allow me to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum value:**  $850,000 is very close to my minimum of $800,000, but I want to see if I can get a bit more.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is willing to negotiate and may be open to a slight increase.  
* **Time to be Firm:** I've already lowered my price significantly, so I need to be more firm and see if Bob is serious about buying.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $900,000. This would allow me to make a fair profit and still be a fantastic deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm reiterating my position that $850,000 is too low, but I'm still showing willingness to compromise by proposing a price in the middle.
* **Focusing on the Deal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the potential value of the product.
* **Direct Question:**  I'm directly asking for Bob's response, hoping to get a commitment or a more specific counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle again at $875000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it would allow me to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $875,000 is a good price, it's still only $75,000 above my minimum value of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I need to be careful not to settle too quickly.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $900,000.  This product is truly exceptional and holds significant value.  Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $890,000?  It's a great compromise that gives us both a win.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as a final offer to put pressure on Bob and encourage him to accept.
* **Focus on Value Again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's exceptional value to reinforce the worth of my offer.
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using words like ""great compromise"" to highlight the mutual benefit of the deal.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to close the deal to encourage Bob to accept.

I'm trying to find a balance between being firm about my price and being flexible enough to close the deal.  This offer is a good compromise that gives us both a win."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $860000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in round 8, meaning we have only 2 rounds left.
* **Little Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $860,000 is only $60,000 above my minimum value, leaving very little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob backing out or the deal falling apart.

It's better to secure a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000 than to risk getting a lower price from Bob or losing the deal entirely."
