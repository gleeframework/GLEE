"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to sell for less, and we have 10 rounds to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a substantial drop from her initial offer, and if she's flexible, she might be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but $13,500 is still too high. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's last offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we have several rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer gives us more opportunities to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. However, I'm still aiming for a price below her last offer. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in the next round."
