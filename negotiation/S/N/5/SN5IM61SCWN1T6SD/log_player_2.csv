"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and a fallback option of buying from John for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's a bit more aggressive. He's offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and aims to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,800 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum price of $10,000 and only $300 above his initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,200 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers or Bob running out of rounds makes this a reasonable decision."
