"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiations.  There are 9 more rounds to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your target price, but I have to ensure I get a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. I'm confident it's a great value for you, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best possible price. While Alice's offer is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if he can further reduce the price in the remaining rounds before deciding to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000.  Let's try $1,050,000 as a compromise.  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,075,000.  This is a decent price, but Bob can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000.  It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and secure the product at the best possible price from John. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and there's always the risk of losing out on the deal altogether."
