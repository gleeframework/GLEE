"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more receptive.
* **Openness:**  The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $7,500 is better than my absolute minimum ($8,000), it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he acknowledged the product's value by making a counteroffer.
* **Time is on my side:** We're only in round 2, and I have 8 more rounds to reach a more favorable deal or sell to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. While $7,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and friendly to maintain a good rapport.

**Strategy:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I aim to encourage him to raise his counteroffer in the next round or potentially accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $8500, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is above my absolute minimum of $8,000.
* **Time is a Factor:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a potential deal with Bob, especially since selling to John would only net me $8,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, it's possible that he might be willing to pay a little more in the future, so I'm leaving the door open for potential future deals."
