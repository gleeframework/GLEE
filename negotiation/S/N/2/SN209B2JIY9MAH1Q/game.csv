"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you consider a lower price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal while also recognizing the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price I can afford, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch. How about we settle somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to go up to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
