"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm eager to make a decision soon.",11500.0,Bob,4,
