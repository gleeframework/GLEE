Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I need to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  If he rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or accept the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if I can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.  I'm aiming for a final price closer to $1,400,000 but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I could try to counter again, it's clear that he's not willing to meet me halfway.  To ensure I don't lose out, I'll accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
