Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth, potentially getting closer to my goal of maximizing profit.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer and potentially enter into a negotiation. 
* **Addressing John:**  While I'm negotiating with Bob, I'm aware of John's offer. This helps me assess the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and potentially needing to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100 and far below my initial offer of $110.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's willingness to negotiate shows there's room to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **John's Offer:** While $100 from John is a guaranteed sale, there's a chance I can get more from Bob.

**Next Step:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $90 is a significant compromise from my initial $110, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob by stating it's ""still a great deal."" This helps him see the benefit of accepting my counteroffer.
* **Maintaining My Minimum:** While I'm dropping the price, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $100. This ensures I'm not selling at a loss. 

I'm hopeful this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $75 remains significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **John's Offer as a safety net:**  While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, John's offer of $100 is a guaranteed sale and protects me from potentially losing out completely. 
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob's willingness to come up to $75 suggests he's open to reaching a compromise.

**Next Step:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to close the gap and reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $75 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. This is a fair price that's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising to close the gap:** My counteroffer of $85 is a significant move towards Bob's offer, showing my commitment to reaching an agreement.  
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  I emphasize ""fair price"" and ""good deal for both of us"" to make the offer more appealing and less about just my own gain.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While $85 is still below my initial goal, it's above my minimum acceptable price and keeps me closer to John's offer, minimizing risk. 

This counteroffer is a calculated move to bridge the remaining gap and hopefully secure a deal with Bob."
