"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $75 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. This is a fair price that's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
