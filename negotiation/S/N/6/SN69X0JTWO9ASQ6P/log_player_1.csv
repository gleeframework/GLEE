Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The price is still comfortably above your $80 minimum, ensuring a profit. 

By offering the product at $90, you have a good chance of securing a sale with Bob while maximizing your potential profit."
