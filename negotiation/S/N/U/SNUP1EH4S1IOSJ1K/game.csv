"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your valuation of the item, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $900,000 to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  This product offers incredible value, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, I cannot agree to $1,050,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000 in hopes of reaching a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
