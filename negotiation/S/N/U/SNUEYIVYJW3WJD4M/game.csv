"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,200 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $9,000?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $8,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $8,600. This is a good compromise and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's make it happen!",8600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Can you meet me at $8,500 or is that the lowest you can go?",8500.0,Bob,8,
