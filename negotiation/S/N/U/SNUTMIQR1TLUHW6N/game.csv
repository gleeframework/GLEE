"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $10,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
