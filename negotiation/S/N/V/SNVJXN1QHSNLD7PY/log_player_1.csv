"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher price point. 
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Time is on my Side:**  With 10 rounds available, I have time to explore other options and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gets us both closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  Instead of rejecting outright, I'm proposing a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Midpoint Offer:** Offering $975,000 is a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to subtly reinforce the price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but given my financial situation, I can't agree to $975,000. I would like to propose $960,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While $960,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.
* **Time for Counter:** I have time to counter again, and potentially secure a better price.
* **Negotiation:** The ongoing negotiation shows Bob is serious about buying, making it worth continuing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $960,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $965,000?  It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a deal, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, showing flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce the price point and justify the offer.
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm actively working to close the gap between our positions, making a deal more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to counter with $962,500. This offers a middle ground between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $962,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating, especially since Bob has been steadfast in his offers.
* **Securing the Deal:**  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of Bob backing out or the negotiation falling apart. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a great option, but it's worth considering that continuing the negotiation could lead to a lower final price.

While I'd prefer a higher price, securing a sale at this point is the most prudent decision given the limited rounds and the possibility of a more unfavorable outcome with continued negotiation."
