Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin.
* **Gauging Interest:**  A high initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, you haven't lost anything. If he counters, you know he's serious.
* **Psychological Impact:**  A higher price often creates a perception of higher value in the buyer's mind. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always come down in price, but you can't go back up."
