"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Considering your own valuation, I'm willing to offer you $9,500. This would give you a good profit while still leaving me room to save some money. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and give you a better deal than my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for $11,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen!",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,250 just yet. I'm going to counter with $10,800. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
