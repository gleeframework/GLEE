"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that high of a price. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price based on the market value and the product's features.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe my initial offer is closer to reflecting the true value this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This still reflects the premium nature of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,375,000?  This represents a significant reduction on my part while still recognizing the product's inherent value.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,310,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the product's unique value proposition.",1310000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,310,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,310,000 and my previous offer of $1,250,000, which is $1,280,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our previous discussions.",1280000.0,Bob,8,
