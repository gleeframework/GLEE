{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal. Offering $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is still above her minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her first one, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Since Bob has 7 rounds left, he can continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. He's not desperate to buy the product yet and can still explore his options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  He's raised his offer from $8,500 to $9,000, showing he's willing to compromise. This counteroffer is still below Alice's latest price, and hopefully, she'll find it appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is the lowest she's gone so far, and Bob is getting closer to his goal of saving money. While he could continue negotiating, he has only 5 rounds left. There's a risk that Alice might become less flexible, or Bob might miss out on a good deal if he waits too long. Accepting the offer at this point secures the product at a price lower than John's offer and provides a reasonable compromise."
