Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a fair price:** $115 is a good middle ground between your minimum ($100) and Bob's maximum ($120). 
* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** By asking ""What do you think?"" you open the door for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Doesn't undervalue the product:**  You're not giving away the product for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum,  it's still lower than your desired price. Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $110? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 110}
