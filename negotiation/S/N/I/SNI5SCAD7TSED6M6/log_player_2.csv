"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good deal, it's still above your personal value of $120.  You want to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $110? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $115 to $110, which is within your price range of $120.  Accepting this offer gets you the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
