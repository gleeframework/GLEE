"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for sending over your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($60), I aim to understand Alice's flexibility and establish a base for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial low offer leaves ample room for me to gradually increase my bid during subsequent rounds while staying well below my $80 maximum. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message maintains a courteous tone while clearly communicating my price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $60 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $90 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $70? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:**  Alice counter-offered at $90, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  I am increasing my offer to $70, demonstrating movement towards a compromise.
* **Staying Below Maximum:** It's important to stay below my $80 maximum budget, leaving some room for potential further negotiation.
* **Seeking a Fair Deal:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price point, reinforcing a collaborative negotiation approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum budget of $80. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John at the same price. This is a successful negotiation outcome!"
