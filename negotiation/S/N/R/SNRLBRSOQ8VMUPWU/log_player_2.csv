"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a significantly lower price."
