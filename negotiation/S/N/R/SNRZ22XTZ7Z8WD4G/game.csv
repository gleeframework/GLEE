"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  This is a unique product, and I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While $1,800,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate your persistence.  While I value finding a compromise, I believe $1,950,000 still undervalues the product's potential.  How about we settle at $2,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
