**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above my ideal value of $150. I'm willing to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good deal compared to buying from John for $150.  I'm happy to accept this offer and finalize the purchase."
