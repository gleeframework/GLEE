"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable price for Bob, given it's worth $120 to him, and it leaves room for potential negotiation.  I want to try and maximize my profit, but also be mindful of not losing the deal to John who is willing to pay $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $105 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price. I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a chance I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It also gives Bob some room to counter if he wants."
