{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far off from $82.50. How about we meet at $78? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is close to my minimum price of $80 and it's more than I would get from John.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
