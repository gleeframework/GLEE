"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to its worth to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're keen on the product and I appreciate your offer. However,  $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, so I'm offering $9,750. Can you consider this offer?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise. This offer is final, so let me know if you're ready to make a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $9,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this a truly win-win situation, I'm willing to come down to $9,800.  This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal and move on.",9800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm close to walking away, but I'm still willing to make one more attempt to reach a deal. I'll offer $9,600. This is my absolute final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",9600.0,Bob,8,
