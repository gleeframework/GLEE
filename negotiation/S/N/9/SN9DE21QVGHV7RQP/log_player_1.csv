I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000 with further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's final offer is getting very close to my floor, but I'm concerned that I'm going to run out of rounds before we can close the deal.  Since I'm already within $200,000 of John's offer, I'm going to sell to John to avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
