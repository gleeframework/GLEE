Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, leaving Bob with a small incentive to buy. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interest"" motivates Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
