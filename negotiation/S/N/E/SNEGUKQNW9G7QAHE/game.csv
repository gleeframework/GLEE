Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's quality and rarity.,20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is my final offer for now.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. Would you be willing to meet me at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'll make a final offer of $16500. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Bob,6,
