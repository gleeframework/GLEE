Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with my bottom line. I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, but it's worth $1,200,000 to me, so I'm going to ask for my full value. If Bob rejects, I can always go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  $1,100,000 is a good compromise, and still gives me a profit. If Bob rejects, I'll reconsider selling to John."
