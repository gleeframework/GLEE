"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $13,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a more reasonable price for my product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
