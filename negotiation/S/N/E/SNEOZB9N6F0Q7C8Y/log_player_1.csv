"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary.  I'm also mindful that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than his initial valuation of $8,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if this negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from $11,000 to $10,500. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than his offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm ready to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price. However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if this negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding out for a good price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will finally be acceptable to Bob. However, if he rejects it, I'll be forced to seriously consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer of $8,800 is too low and is getting closer to his initial valuation.  With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely we'll be able to reach a mutually acceptable price. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
