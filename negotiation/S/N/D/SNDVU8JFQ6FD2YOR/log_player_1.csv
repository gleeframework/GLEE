Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is a little above Bob's perceived value but gives us room to negotiate. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate until we reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a deal before John's offer expires. It's safer to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
