"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,300,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's good to know you have another seller, but you want to save as much money as possible."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Starting low gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Target price in mind:** Aiming for a price close to Alice's value ($1,200,000) will likely motivate her to consider your offer.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  A $100,000 gap still allows for a few rounds of negotiation before reaching a deal."
