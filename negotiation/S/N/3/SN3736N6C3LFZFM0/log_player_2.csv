"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly better than her original offer.  It's still worth trying to get a better price. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he's still better off than buying from John.  He should try one more counteroffer before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffers are getting closer to her initial offer.  While Bob could keep negotiating, the price is getting close to his limit.  It's not worth the risk of Alice refusing further counteroffers and leaving him to pay John's higher price.  Buying from John is the safer option."
