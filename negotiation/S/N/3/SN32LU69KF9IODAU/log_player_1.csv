"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. It allows for some negotiation room while still providing me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's not a desirable outcome. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm countering with $125.  This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It still allows for profit while showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll continue to reject Bob's offer of $100. I'm still hoping to get a better price. It's risky, but I have several rounds left and haven't completely ruled out a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $115. This shows flexibility and might make Bob reconsider. I'm still aiming for a better price than John's offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire. Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge from $100, and I'm running out of time to get a better deal.  To avoid risking getting nothing at all, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's not ideal, but it guarantees a sale and a minimum profit."
