"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It demonstrates that I'm confident in the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving a healthy margin for me. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get more, there are only 6 rounds left.  Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiations falling apart."
