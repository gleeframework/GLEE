"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is truly interested and what his potential range might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my previous offer of $12000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  Even though it's closer to my minimum, I believe we can still negotiate further. I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $12,000.  However, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to come down to $12,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe you'll be happy with this product at this price."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

I'm offering $12,750, which is halfway between my previous offer of $13,500 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows that I'm flexible and willing to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value. This is my last counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to stick to my original offer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product. Thank you for considering my proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is sticking to his offer of $12,000, which is still lower than what I'd prefer.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. It's better to guarantee the $10,000 from John than risk ending up with nothing."
