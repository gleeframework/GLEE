{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to keep the negotiation open. How about we aim for a price of $725,000? This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $710,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 710000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet halfway, Bob. Let's try $715,000 for the product. This price reflects the value you're getting while allowing us to close the deal. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $715,000, which is only $5,000 above my last offer.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only take longer and might not yield a significantly better price.  It's time to accept the offer and move forward with the deal."
