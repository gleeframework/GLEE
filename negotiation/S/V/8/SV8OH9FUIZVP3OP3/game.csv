"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to keep the negotiation open. How about we aim for a price of $725,000? This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $710,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",710000.0,Bob,4,
