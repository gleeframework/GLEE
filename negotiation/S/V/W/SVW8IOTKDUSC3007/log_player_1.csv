Bob is still significantly under the value John offers.  It's worth risking another counter-offer to see if we can push Bob closer to $1,250,000."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's slightly less than our target, accepting Bob's offer at $1,212,500 is the most strategic decision at this point:

* **Exceeds John's Offer:** Bob's offer is still more profitable than selling to John for $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Continuously rejecting Bob's offers risks creating a stalemate or causing him to walk away from the deal entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Securing a deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds and potential delays."
