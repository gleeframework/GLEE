"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly above your valuation.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. I think this price is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference and go with $950,000. This price would allow me to move forward with the purchase, while still providing you with a healthy profit.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, as I previously offered. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm starting to consider other options. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $1,075,000. This is my absolute best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
