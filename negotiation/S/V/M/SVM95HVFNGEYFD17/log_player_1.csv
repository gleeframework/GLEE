Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly above your valuation.  Let me know what you think.
