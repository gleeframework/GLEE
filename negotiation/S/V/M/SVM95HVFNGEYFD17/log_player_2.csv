**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. I think this price is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your target price, it's still above the $1,200,000 you're willing to spend.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference and go with $950,000. This price would allow me to move forward with the purchase, while still providing you with a healthy profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, as I previously offered. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm starting to consider other options. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $1,075,000. This is my absolute best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is still above your maximum price of $1,200,000. It's not worth continuing to negotiate as you're unlikely to get a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether. You're better off purchasing the product from John for $1,200,000."
