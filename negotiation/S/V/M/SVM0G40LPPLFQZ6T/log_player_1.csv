Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $110, you leave some room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. This price point is likely to be attractive to Bob while maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John if Bob declines."
