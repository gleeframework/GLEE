"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm!  However, $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $135, the product is still cheaper than buying from John.  Since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
