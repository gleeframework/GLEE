Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested in this price, and if not, we can go from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one.  Hopefully, this will be agreeable to him, but I'm still prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $125 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal!"
