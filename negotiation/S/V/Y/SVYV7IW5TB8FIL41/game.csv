"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident the product will be a great investment for your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to a price point that works for me.  However, I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000? I think that's more than fair.",700000.0,Bob,4,
