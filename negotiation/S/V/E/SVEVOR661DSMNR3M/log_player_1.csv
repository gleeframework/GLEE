Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's just perceived value, can make the offer seem more palatable.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $120 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward if Bob counters, but don't go below your $120 minimum."
