"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, I believe this product is worth considerably more in the current market.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
