"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point, and hopefully allows for some negotiation space.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm serious about selling the product, and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. There's a chance I can get a better price, and I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting this price. It's a significant reduction from my previous offer and shows I'm willing to compromise.  If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John, but I'm still hoping to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've gone through several rounds and Bob is stubbornly refusing to go above $80.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  I'm not going to risk continuing to negotiate and possibly getting stuck with a lower price than I'd like.  It's time to take the sure thing with John and sell the product for $100."
