{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is a tough one, as Bob's final offer is the same as what John is offering.  However, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiations, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure the sale now with John and avoid any further risk of a counteroffer from Bob that could potentially lead to a lower price."
