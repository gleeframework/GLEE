The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90.  It's a good deal, but I can likely get it for less. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Alice $75. This is a significant discount from her original price, but still within my budget. Hopefully, she'll be willing to accept it."

Alice is coming down in price, but I still think I can get it for less than $85. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
