"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a bit less. How does $100 sound? It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is a good deal, but there's a chance you could get it for even less. Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price."
