{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also positions the offer as a good deal for Bob, which might increase his likelihood of accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at $115. However, I am hoping to keep my budget under $120. Would you consider selling the product for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial offer, and it's still above my minimum value of $100. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit."
