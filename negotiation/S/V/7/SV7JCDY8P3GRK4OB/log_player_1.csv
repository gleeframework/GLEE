Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to overprice the product and risk Bob rejecting your offer.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Start with an offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
2. **Provide Justification:**  You can subtly hint at the product's value to you without revealing your absolute bottom line. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is a fair reflection of its value.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,400,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Phrases like ""unique features"" and ""confident it will exceed your expectations"" subtly reinforce the product's worth. 
* **No Ultimatums:** This initial offer avoids any language that might seem aggressive or pushy. You want to maintain a positive tone for a potential negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Bob may counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate based on your assessment of the situation."
