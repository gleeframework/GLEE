# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 3

# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit shy of my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
