"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  However, $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal; it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
