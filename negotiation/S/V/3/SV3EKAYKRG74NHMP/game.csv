"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000, which is $11,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
