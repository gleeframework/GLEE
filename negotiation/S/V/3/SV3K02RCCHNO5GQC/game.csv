"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm not quite ready to meet that price. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but my budget is closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that figure?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it's a compromise that I think we can both be comfortable with.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to make this purchase.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price given the value you place on it. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
