"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $90, as it's worth at least $100 to me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $120.  This is a compromise, as I'm still above my minimum price, but it shows willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price. I am happy to accept this offer as it meets my minimum requirements and allows me to close the deal."
