Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $165 is getting closer to my minimum value. It's also more than I would get from selling to John.  I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
