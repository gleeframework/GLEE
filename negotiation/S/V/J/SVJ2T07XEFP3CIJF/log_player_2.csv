"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its industry and has the potential to revolutionize the way people work. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $750000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget, so I'm going to try to negotiate a better price. There's a strong chance she's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $750,000 is a bit too low for me to justify purchasing right now.  I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it, given its potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting my counteroffer at $1,200,000, which is a significant jump from Alice's initial offer. This shows her that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to settle for her initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential compromise. I'm aiming to find a price that's fair to both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and respectful, which helps build rapport and encourages Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant improvement from her initial price.  It's also below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will result in a price closer to my initial counteroffer.  Accepting her offer now ensures I get a good deal and saves time."
