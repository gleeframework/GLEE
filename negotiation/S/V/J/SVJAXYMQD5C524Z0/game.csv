"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I'd really like to make a deal with you, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
