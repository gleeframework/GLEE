"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $112? It's still a good deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $108? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal",108.0,Bob,4,
