Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll love it.
