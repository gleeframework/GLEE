"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his own valuation ($12,000) as possible, but he needs to be realistic. He knows Alice is looking for a profit, so he's offering a price that leaves some room for negotiation.  He's also accounting for the fact that he has 10 rounds to negotiate, so he can start with a fairly aggressive offer and adjust as needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, but it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further.  Buying from John right now would cost Bob more than he's willing to spend."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his target price of $12,000. He's hoping that Alice will realize she's not going to get a better deal from him and accept this offer. If she rejects it, Bob can continue to negotiate, but he's starting to get closer to his own valuation and doesn't want to go much lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob is getting closer to his maximum price, but there's still some room for negotiation. He can make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal before he has to buy from John. He has several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a slight concession in this round by increasing his offer.  He's still trying to stay close to his target price of $12,000, but realizes that he might have to compromise a bit to get a deal.  He's also considering that he's already rejected Alice's offer twice and doesn't want to risk her getting too frustrated and walking away.  He has several rounds left, but needs to start showing some flexibility to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now getting too close to John's price.  Bob has already made several concessions and is starting to run out of time. With only a few rounds left, the potential savings are no longer worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at this point, as he's guaranteed the product at a price that's still within his budget."
