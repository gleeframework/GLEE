"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
