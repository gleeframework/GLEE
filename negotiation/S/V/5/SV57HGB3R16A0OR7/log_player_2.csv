Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.
