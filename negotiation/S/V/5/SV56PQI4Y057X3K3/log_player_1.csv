"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to drastically lower my price just to close a deal. I'm confident I can find a better price with Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still too low for me.  I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.  I believe I can get a better deal with Bob or John."
