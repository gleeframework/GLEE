"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure about $135. I've done some research, and I think I can get it for cheaper elsewhere. Can you meet me at $128?",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, but $128 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $132. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $132 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. Can you meet me at $129?",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $129 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but that means $130.50. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",130.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've made a good offer at $129, and I think that's a fair price. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you accept $129?",129.0,Bob,8,
