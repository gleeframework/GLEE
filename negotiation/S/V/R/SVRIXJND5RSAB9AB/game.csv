"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product could be interesting for me, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $7,500?  I think that's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
