"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also sets the initial expectation high. I don't know Bob's budget, so it's better to start with a high price and see how he reacts.  If he rejects, I can lower the price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him. I have nine rounds left and I'm not in a hurry to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $780,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if we can close the deal closer to my target. I have six rounds left before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering the price again to $850,000. This is a good compromise, as it's only $50,000 below my minimum and might be attractive to Bob. I'm hoping he will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $770,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $770,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. 

Bob is clearly not willing to go higher than $770,000. I've only got 4 rounds left and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from him.  John is offering a guaranteed $800,000, which is my minimum. It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting a lower price or no sale at all."
