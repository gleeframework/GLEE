"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1000000 to you, and it's a game-changer in your field. I'm offering it to you for $1100000, a price I believe is fair considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a good price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product's value is intrinsically tied to its potential, which I believe warrants a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $950000. It's a fair compromise that reflects both the value and your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $925000. I believe this price reflects a good balance between the product's value and my financial constraints.",925000.0,Bob,4,
