"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think you might really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since your goal is to save money, and John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  You can reject it and still get the product for the same price from John."
