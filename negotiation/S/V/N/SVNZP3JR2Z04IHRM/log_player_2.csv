"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to Bob, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure an even better price. Buying from John right away would mean missing out on the opportunity to potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still acknowledges the value of the product. It shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair price. By offering $650,000, Bob is creating space for negotiation while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is still a significant discount from the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) and is significantly better than buying from John.  While there's still room for negotiation, accepting this offer secures the product at a good price without risking further negotiations and potentially losing the deal altogether."
