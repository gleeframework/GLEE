Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product, even though I don't know Bob's specific needs. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price than my minimum. If he rejects, I can adjust my price or move on to John, my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not immediately settling. There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price.
* **Exploring Counteroffers:** Rejecting his offer allows me to see if I can get him to pay closer to my initial asking price of $150. 
* **No Loss:** If the negotiation doesn't yield a higher price, I can always sell to John for $120.

By rejecting, I'm keeping the negotiation open and potentially gaining a better outcome than settling for Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. This shows I'm open to negotiation but also value the product.
* **Midpoint:** $135 is a midpoint between my initial offer ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). This is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to meet me halfway. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a profit margin higher than my minimum. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I would ideally like to get closer to $135, it's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will either stand firm at $125 or offer even less. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  If I reject, I risk losing a sale to Bob and having to settle for the $120 from John.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's only slightly lower than my minimum and avoids the potential for a lower offer or no deal at all."
