Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, while still ensuring a profit above John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $149 might make Bob feel like he's getting a bad deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright."
