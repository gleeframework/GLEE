"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), I believe I can still get a higher price. I have 8 rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Bob or sell to John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $13500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise and only $500 less than my previous counteroffer.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk he'll walk away or that I'll reach my 10-round limit. Accepting this offer ensures I make a decent profit and close the deal within a reasonable timeframe."
