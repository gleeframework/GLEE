"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  A $12,500 counteroffer is a strong starting point, as it is a substantial reduction while still offering a price that might be acceptable to Alice.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for potential negotiation, as it's still slightly above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a counteroffer, Bob keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids automatically going to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can keep pushing for a better deal. He's likely to counter with a price closer to his target of $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $13,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer but still staying below Alice's price.  This shows good faith and encourages continued negotiation.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering to split the difference between the previous round's offers often feels like a fair compromise and can be a powerful negotiation tactic.
* **Staying Within Budget:** $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer."
