I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a higher price than what it's worth to him, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping to strike a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $140, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. This is still above what the product is worth to him, but closer to his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $130 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to accept it and avoid further negotiation."
