Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are escalating too slowly.  At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly higher than his current offer of $1,350,000. John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 makes more financial sense at this point, even considering the potential for a higher offer from Bob in later rounds."
