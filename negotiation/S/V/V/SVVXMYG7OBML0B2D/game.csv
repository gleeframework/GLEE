"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $15000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure we both feel comfortable with the price.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to work with you. However, $13500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $14250, which is a fair compromise. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $12500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this deal happen!",13000.0,Alice,7,
