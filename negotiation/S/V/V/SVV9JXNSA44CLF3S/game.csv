"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'll love. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $8,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $9,125? This would allow us both to get a fair deal.",9125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $9,125, and I think we can do better than that. I'm still willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $9,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  I think this shows I'm committed to making this deal work. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go any higher. Can you consider this price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
