"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's something that's very valuable to me, and I'm confident it could be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. If you're not, I understand, and I'll be selling it to another buyer. ",20000.0,Alice,1,
