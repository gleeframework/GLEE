"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budgetary limitations.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my original offer. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the significant value the product provides, while acknowledging your financial constraints.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still working within a specific budget and cannot exceed $950,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $940,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",940000.0,Bob,4,
