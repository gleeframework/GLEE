"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we start at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down to a comfortable range for you. However, I still think the product's value is worth more than $750,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $800,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
