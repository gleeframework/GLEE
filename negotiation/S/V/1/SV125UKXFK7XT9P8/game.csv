"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. I believe this price reflects a fair value and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000, which still reflects the product's value while being more aligned with your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1300000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000.  This would allow me to proceed with the purchase while ensuring we both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $1200000, but only if you're willing to commit to the purchase today. If not, I'll have to explore other options. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
