"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $100 is your maximum, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for the possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significant counteroffer (20% less) can encourage Alice to negotiate.  It signals that you're serious about buying but are looking for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk she'll hold firm or become less willing to deal.  Accepting saves me $10 and keeps the negotiation from potentially dragging on."
