"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a little lower than my minimum but gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also ready to counter if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $85. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $120, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $92.50 is still beyond my budget. I am willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. How about we meet in the middle at $91? That's only a dollar more than your last offer, and it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 91} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I am willing to pay $88 for the product. Let's hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is offering $88, which is still below my minimum of $120.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a mutually acceptable price in that time. It's better to sell to John for $120 and guarantee a good return."
