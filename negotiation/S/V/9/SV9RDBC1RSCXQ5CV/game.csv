"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. Let's find a compromise. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering its worth to both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
