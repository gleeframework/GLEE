"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price, and starting with a counteroffer of $12,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $14,000, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also shows Bob's serious intent to purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal compared to buying from John.  At this point, there's a good chance that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. Bob should accept the offer and secure the product for a reasonable price."
