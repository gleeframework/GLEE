Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Considering its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly reveal the product's value to Bob, it emphasizes its worth and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency often encourages quicker decision-making, making Bob less likely to overthink or stall.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Bob is highly interested in the product and potentially willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* **Relationship Dynamics:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive approach might be preferable."
