"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum price point.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my eagerness to strike a deal with you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to securing this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
