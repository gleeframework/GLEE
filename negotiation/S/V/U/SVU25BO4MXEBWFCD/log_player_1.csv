Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is more than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and gives Bob a bit of wiggle room.  It also opens the door for further discussion.  By offering a price and asking for his opinion, I am encouraging Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still achieve a higher price through continued negotiation.  The product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's room for compromise.  By rejecting his offer, I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly lower than the value this product holds for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Given the situation, I believe $12,000 remains the maximum I can afford. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has remained firm at his $12,000 offer, which is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there is no guarantee that he will budge further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the sale with John for the same amount.  This ensures a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not yield a better outcome."
