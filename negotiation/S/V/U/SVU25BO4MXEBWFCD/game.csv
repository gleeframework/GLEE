"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly lower than the value this product holds for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
