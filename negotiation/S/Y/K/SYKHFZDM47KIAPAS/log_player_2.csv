It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. She seems firmly set on a price above your $925,000 limit. While you could continue negotiating, there's a real risk she won't budge further, and you'll end up having to take John's offer anyway. It's better to secure the $1,000,000 deal with John now rather than risk paying more."
