"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, I'm not quite comfortable with that price point. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is my final offer before we discuss further",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's my absolute limit.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $925,000. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $950,000. This is my last offer before I consider other options",950000.0,Alice,7,
