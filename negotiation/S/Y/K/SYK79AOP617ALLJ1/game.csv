"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this product holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1500000.  This is a competitive price, considering its potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider. The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a fair compromise given its value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your effort to find a solution. While $1100000 is closer, it's still below the value I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1150000, which represents a fair compromise for both of us. I believe this is a solid price given the product's potential.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1125000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
