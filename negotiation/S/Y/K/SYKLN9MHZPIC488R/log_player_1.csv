Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. Let's try $1,150,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the potential value of the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to be close to your asking price, but $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and this offer is above my minimum. It's better to take a small profit now than risk losing the deal entirely."
