Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], afterwards it will be made available elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential earnings. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so starting closer to that figure increases the chance of a larger profit margin.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing within a range that's more beneficial than John's offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Setting a deadline creates urgency for Bob to decide before the opportunity disappears.
* **Alternative Option:**  The message subtly hints at the existence of another buyer (John), which could incentivize Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive starting price could be considered.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., highly risk-averse or a tough negotiator), adjust the approach accordingly."
