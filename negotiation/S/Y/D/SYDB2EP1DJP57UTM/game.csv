"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Could you consider something closer to $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $700,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Could we compromise on $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still below what I consider acceptable.  How about we settle at $825,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $750,000. I'm willing to make one more offer: $775,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
