"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product,  $18,000 is significantly higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This would still allow you to make a good profit and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to purchasing this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try $12,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $12,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $16,000. It's a fair price that balances our interests, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
