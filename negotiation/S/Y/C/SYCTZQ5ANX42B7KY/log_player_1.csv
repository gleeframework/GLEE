Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product,  $18,000 is significantly higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This would still allow you to make a good profit and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to purchasing this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try $12,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What are your thoughts?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence.

It's a fair price that balances our interests, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
