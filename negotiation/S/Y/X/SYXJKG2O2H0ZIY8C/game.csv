"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is considerably below its value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm comfortable offering $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm motivated to find a solution. How about we settle on $15,500? This allows me to make a fair profit and ensures you're getting a great deal on a valuable product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
