"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is still a significant markup from Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me closer to the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a price closer to $1,500,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the value I place on the product.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable value. I've been negotiating with him for a while now, and while I would prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely.  Accepting his offer is the most logical choice."
