"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John is selling for, you can potentially get the product for even cheaper. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $130, which is still a good price for me.  It's worth it to accept this offer, as it's significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely I'll get a better deal and it's not worth risking losing the deal to John."
