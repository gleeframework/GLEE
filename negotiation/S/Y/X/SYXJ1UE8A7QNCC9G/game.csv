"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I am willing to offer $10,000 for it. I hope this proposal works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. While I understand your perspective, I'm still unable to meet at $13,000. I propose we set the price at $12,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
