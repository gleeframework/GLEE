This is a starting point. I'm offering a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport by suggesting it's a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, based on my research and budget, I am only able to offer $9500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price just yet.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is my lowest price. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a reasonable price for my product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet at $10500. Would you consider $10000 as a fair offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a fair deal for both of us.  I'll accept it and sell the product to Bob."
