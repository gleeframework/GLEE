"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the fairness of your proposal. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,375,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but unfortunately, $1,375,000 still exceeds my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $1,360,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1360000.0,Bob,4,
