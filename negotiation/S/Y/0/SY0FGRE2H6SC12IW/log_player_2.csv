I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a lower price. This offer is closer to Alice's potential minimum, increasing the likelihood of her accepting it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $912,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $890,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. This is a reasonable compromise that I believe we can both agree on. Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is slightly higher than my previous offer, showing Alice I am serious about purchasing the product. However, it is still significantly lower than Alice's current offer, and it's closer to the midpoint of our desired prices. This increased offer might motivate Alice to accept, as it's a compromise that gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $907,500 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $895,000, which is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 895000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a moderate increase from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product. However, it's still below her current offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also standing firm on my desired price point.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $895,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer the product to you for $915,000. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and with only one round left, I don't have enough time to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product from John, so I'm going to buy it from him. It's not the ideal price, but it's better than settling for a price I'm not comfortable with."
