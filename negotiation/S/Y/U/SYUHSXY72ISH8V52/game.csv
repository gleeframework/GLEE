"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me. Would you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the product is worth $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,000?  That's a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value I have in the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
