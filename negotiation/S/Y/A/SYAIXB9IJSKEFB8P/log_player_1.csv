Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:** The message emphasizes a willingness to discuss and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable, knowing I have a backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to cover the value I place on the product.
* **There's potential for a better deal.** By rejecting, I can counter with a higher price and see if Bob is willing to budge further.
* **John is still a safety net.**  If negotiations fall through, I have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point.  How about $1,000,000?  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's within your budget and closer to my asking price. Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone, emphasizing a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** This price point is a good balance, allowing for potential future negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's initial offer."
