"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a significantly high offer to establish a strong anchor point. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't undervalue the product. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will help me gauge Bob's interest and potential price sensitivity. His response will inform my subsequent moves.
* **John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed buyer in John provides me with a strong alternative if negotiations with Bob don't proceed favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It indicates he sees value in the product, but we're still far apart.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are 8 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a better deal. A rejection now doesn't necessarily mean losing Bob as a potential buyer.
* **John as Leverage:**  While I'm not selling to John immediately, his offer provides me with a strong bargaining position. I can afford to be patient and strategic in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than $1,400,000. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I'm lowering my price significantly from the initial offer, I'm still aiming high to leave room for further negotiation.  
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value, aiming to shift his perception closer to mine.
* **Testing the Water:** This counteroffer will gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be and provide further insight into his negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has increased his offer considerably from his initial $1,400,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time Value:** While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of reaching a significantly better deal. Accepting now eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or the deal falling through in later rounds."
