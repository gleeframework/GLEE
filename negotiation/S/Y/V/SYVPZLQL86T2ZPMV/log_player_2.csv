"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than its worth to you, and I'll be able to make a strong profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get the product for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising the price again exists.  Accepting the offer at $1,100,000 saves Bob $400,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to him."
