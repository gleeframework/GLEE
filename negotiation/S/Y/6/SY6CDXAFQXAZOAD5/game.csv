"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a substantial discount from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap!",825000.0,Alice,3,
