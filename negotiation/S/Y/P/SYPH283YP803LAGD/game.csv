"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you meet me halfway or consider a slightly lower price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'd like to propose a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and potential benefits to you.
