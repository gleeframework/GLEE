Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe will be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $25,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I want to try to get a better price, and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I can offer you a slightly adjusted price of $18,000. This price is still very reasonable and reflects the true worth of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I must respectfully decline. I am looking to stay within a budget of $8000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and while $8,000 is better than John's offer, it's still far from my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm not willing to risk further negotiations and will take John's offer to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
