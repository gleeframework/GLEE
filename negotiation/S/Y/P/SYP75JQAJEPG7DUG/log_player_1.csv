Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $925,000.  This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we want to secure the highest possible price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($925,000) creates a strong incentive for him to accept. It represents a significant saving for him compared to his perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a fallback option with John at $800,000, ensuring we don't lose out completely if Bob declines.

This approach balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the negotiation dynamics."
