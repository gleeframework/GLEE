"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $900,000 from Alice, and buying it from John for $1,000,000 is a worse option.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $880000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price than $880,000.  While this is closer to his target price, there's still room for negotiation.  He should counter-offer and aim for a price closer to his maximum of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $880,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $870000, but I think we can do better than that. Let's try $870000, and I'll throw in some additional support and services to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $870,000 is a good price considering he's willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.  While he could potentially get it for a bit less, there's a risk Alice will reject further counter-offers, leaving him with only John's offer of $1,000,000.  Accepting the deal now ensures a good price and avoids further risk."
