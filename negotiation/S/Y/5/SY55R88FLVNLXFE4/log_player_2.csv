I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget of $800,000. This shows Alice my serious intent to buy but also sets a clear boundary.  It's highly unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, although it's getting closer.  It's getting risky to keep pushing for a lower price as I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. However, I want to see if I can secure a price closer to my limit, and there are still a few rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm pushing for a price closer to my limit, but also demonstrating flexibility by increasing my offer to $975,000. It's a significant increase from my last offer, showing Alice that I'm getting closer to a point where I'm willing to buy.  This could incentivize her to accept, knowing we are nearing the end of the rounds."
