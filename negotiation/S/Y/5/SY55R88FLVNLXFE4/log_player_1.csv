"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to maximize my profit, and I'm confident I can still get a decent price, even if Bob counters. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial High Offer:**  A high starting point sets the tone and gives me more leverage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,700,000 is ambitious, it's not unreasonable considering my minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to be aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is way too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Selling to John is also an option, but I'd prefer to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob before going that route.

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:**  $800,000 is simply too far below my minimum price.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and countering.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  While selling to John is an option, I want to explore all negotiation possibilities before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's low offer with a price of $1,200,000. This is still above his initial offer but significantly lower than my first offer, showing willingness to compromise. This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** $1,200,000 is still considerably higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my value for the product.
* **Potential for Acceptance:**  I believe this price is reasonable enough that Bob might accept it.
* **John as Backup:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his initial offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for improvement, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unacceptable:**  $900,000 is not a financially viable option for me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, especially with John as a backup buyer. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By rejecting this offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair deal.
* **Time is a Factor:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to keep the number of rounds in mind to avoid ending up with a low offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with a price of $1,100,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining a price that reflects the product's value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by a substantial amount.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,100,000 is still well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, indicating that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Pressure on Bob:**  This counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still confident that I can sell to John for a higher price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There are only 4 rounds left, and I need to maximize my profit.  I'm not ready to settle for this price yet, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unacceptable:** $950,000 is not a satisfactory price for me, given the product's value.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  Time is running out, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my desired profit margin.
* **John as a Backup:**  The option of selling to John for $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal from Bob.
* **Potential for a Higher Offer:** I'm optimistic that with continued negotiation, I can secure a more profitable sale."

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:** $1,050,000 is still well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 and represents a significant profit for me.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to push for a deal while maintaining my price point.
* **John as a Backup:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option of selling to John for a higher price. However, I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement before resorting to that."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Although there is still room for negotiation, I'm now in a position where I have to weigh the potential for a better offer against the risk of losing the deal altogether. Given the limited time, I'm choosing to accept the sure profit of selling to John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds left, I need to make a decisive decision.
* **Minimal Profit:**  While Bob's offer has increased, it's still not financially attractive enough. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which meets my minimum requirement.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  There's no guarantee that I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
