"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
