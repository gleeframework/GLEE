"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help you gauge how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His reaction (counteroffer or rejection) will provide valuable information for the next round. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly above your minimum selling price of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob's counteroffer suggests the product holds substantial value for him. It's likely he'd be willing to go higher.
* **Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer allows you to continue negotiating confidently. You're not pressured to accept a less-than-ideal offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While you rejected Bob's offer, you're showing willingness to negotiate by significantly decreasing your asking price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties and potentially expedite the process.
* **Maintaining Value:** You're still holding firm above your minimum and signaling that the product is worth a premium price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob's offer now matches your absolute minimum selling price. There's no room for further negotiation unless you're willing to go below your threshold.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at your minimum. There's no risk of losing the sale or engaging in further lengthy negotiations with Bob.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer or the deal falling through. Accepting John's offer provides immediate and certain profit."
