Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($15,000) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives Alice a strong bargaining position. She doesn't *need* to go below that price."
