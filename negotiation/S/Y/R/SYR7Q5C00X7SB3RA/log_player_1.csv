Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob at $1,150,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and it leaves room for negotiation. 
* I believe this price is attractive to Bob because it's still below the $1,200,000 value he places on the product.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if I can secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and adjust my next offer accordingly. I also have the safety net of John's offer, which allows me to walk away from the negotiation if I don't feel like I'm getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I am not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can continue to try and close the gap between our desired prices. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to try and reach a compromise with Bob, potentially somewhere in the middle of our current positions. If Bob continues to be unwilling to negotiate, I will then consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get a price closer to my initial offer. 
* I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, as it's significantly lower than his perceived value of $1,200,000. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to continue to negotiate with Bob, but I am willing to lower my price gradually to reach a compromise.  I am also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob remains unwilling to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $980,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me halfway. 

**Strategy:**

While I want to maximize my profit, I don't want to risk losing out completely. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a good price and ensures I don't have to continue the negotiation with Bob.  It's also a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer and potentially having him reject any further counteroffers."
