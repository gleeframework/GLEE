"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that 85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at 87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $87.5 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above Alice's minimum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference again and go with $86.25? "", ""product_price"": 86.25}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try 88.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  While $88.50 is closer to Alice's desired price, Bob can still get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  Even if Bob doesn't get a lower price, they are still within their budget, and have time to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. Let's try $87.  This is the best I can do at the moment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 88? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $88 is less than Bob's maximum of $100. 
* **Time is running out:** This is Round 7, and the negotiation could break down if Bob rejects the offer.  While Bob could try to get a lower price, it's unlikely Alice will budge further.
* **Avoiding the fallback option:** Buying from John for $100 would cost Bob more.  Accepting Alice's offer is a better deal. 

Bob should accept the offer to get the product at a fair price before the negotiation falls apart or he has to settle for a higher price from John."
