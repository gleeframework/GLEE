"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $15000 to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for less than $14,000.  Since Alice values the product at $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  This price would still leave you with a healthy profit while giving me a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your offer. In light of that, I am willing to consider $13500 as a fair price for the product. This allows us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and still allows him to save $1,500 compared to buying from John.  While there might be a chance to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing out on the product to another buyer is too high at this point. Accepting the offer is the most logical decision."
