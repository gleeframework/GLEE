"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $9,500. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but $9,500 is already a very competitive price for this product.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, but I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet in the middle.",8750.0,Bob,4,
