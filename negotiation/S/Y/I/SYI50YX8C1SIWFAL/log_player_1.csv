{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  This gives him incentive to negotiate, but it's not so high that he'll immediately reject it.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still getting a good price, and you have the option to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept.
* **It's a starting point:**  This allows for negotiation and gives you room to compromise if needed."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my target, but I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet.  I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, so I'm going to explore other options before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This would allow me to get a fair price while still allowing you to get a good deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the product's value and my budget, I am willing to pay up to $1,060,000 for it. This price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk of losing a guaranteed sale to John.  John is offering me my minimum price, and I'm confident that this is the best outcome for me."
