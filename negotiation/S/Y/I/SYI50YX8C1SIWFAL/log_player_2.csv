Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This would allow me to get a fair price while still allowing you to get a good deal on a valuable product.
