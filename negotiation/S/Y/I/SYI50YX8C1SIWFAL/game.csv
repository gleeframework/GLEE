"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This would allow me to get a fair price while still allowing you to get a good deal on a valuable product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
