Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value you're putting on this deal. I can do $800,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?

Alice is now at her lowest price.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this is a fair deal.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
