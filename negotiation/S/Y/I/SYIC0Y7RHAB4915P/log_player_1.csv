Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for higher profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than you do or has a strong need for it.  A higher initial offer explores this possibility.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Even if $1,500,000 is too high for Bob, it opens the door for negotiation.  You can always lower the price slightly during the discussion, aiming to settle above your minimum."
