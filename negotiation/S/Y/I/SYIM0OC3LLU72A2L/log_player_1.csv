"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get close to the product's value to Bob while also securing a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I have 8 rounds left and am confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the significant value you'll gain from the product.  Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $1,000,000 as a fair price for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to $1,050,000, $1,000,000 is still a great deal for me. It's significantly above my minimum of $800,000 and leaves me with a comfortable profit. Accepting this offer makes the most financial sense at this point."
