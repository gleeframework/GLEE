"Alice, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $20000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to go to $12000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",18000.0,Alice,5,
