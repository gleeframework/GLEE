"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe will significantly benefit your endeavors. Given its value to you, I propose a special offer of $14,000 for it. This price not only represents an excellent opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset but also ensures a fair return for us. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than what you could get it for from John ($15,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer at a lower price, closer to her value of $12,000."
