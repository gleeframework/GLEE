"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I am unable to meet the price of $12000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price? I'm hoping for something closer to $8000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $10200. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal!",10200.0,Alice,5,
