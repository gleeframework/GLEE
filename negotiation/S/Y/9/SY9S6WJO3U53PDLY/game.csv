"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $8500 is still just a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $9250. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to what we want. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to split the difference again - I'm willing to meet you at $8750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8750.0,Bob,6,
