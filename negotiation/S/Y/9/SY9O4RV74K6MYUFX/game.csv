"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can do $10,500, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
