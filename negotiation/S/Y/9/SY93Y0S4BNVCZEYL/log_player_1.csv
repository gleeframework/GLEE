Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This price is likely to be rejected, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, ensuring I won't be stuck with a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get more, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Selling to John is an option, but I'm not willing to settle for that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than my minimum. This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to drop to his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, I'm starting to feel the pressure. Selling to John guarantees a good profit, but it's not the highest I could potentially get.  At this point, I'm willing to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of a lower counteroffer from Bob."
