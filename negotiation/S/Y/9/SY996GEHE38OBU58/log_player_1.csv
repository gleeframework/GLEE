"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your desired selling price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:**  While aiming high, it's important to propose a price that Bob might still consider reasonable. A price too close to his perceived value ($1,500,000) leaves little incentive for him to negotiate.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer is primarily to understand Bob's willingness to pay and set the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a bit higher than the product's worth, and I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000) and my desired selling price. 

There's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. How about we meet halfway at $1,375,000?"",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $1,375,000, I'm proposing a compromise that shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying a higher price.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids getting stuck at the lower price Bob initially proposed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,375,000 is the best price for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has significantly dropped his offer to $1,250,000, which is getting very close to John's standing offer. While I want to secure the best possible price, holding out much longer risks losing both Bob and John.  I'll make one more strong counter-offer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price.  However, $1,250,000 is below what I can accept.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,325,000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial price and reflects my strong desire to do business with you. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm clearly stating this is my last offer to signal seriousness and avoid endless back-and-forth.
* **Justified Price:**  I'm emphasizing that $1,325,000 is my bottom line while reiterating it's a considerable price reduction.
* **Time Pressure:** By implying I have other options, I'm subtly introducing time pressure for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm mentally prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob rejects this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to see a bit more of a discount. How about we try $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly set on a price below $1,300,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that he'll agree to a price significantly higher than his current offer of $1,275,000. 

This offer is more than John's $1,200,000, and the time spent negotiating further might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's time to accept the offer and secure a reasonable profit."
