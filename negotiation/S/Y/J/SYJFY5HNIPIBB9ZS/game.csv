"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable with a price of $900000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I've assessed for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the potential of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1000000 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to reach an agreement closer to $950000.  I think that's a fair price considering the potential of this product and the savings for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective.  $950000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $975000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
