Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable with a price of $900000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I have several rounds left to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I've assessed for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1000000 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to reach an agreement closer to $950000.  I think that's a fair price considering the potential of this product and the savings for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. I have several rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's not fair to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective.  $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $975,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
