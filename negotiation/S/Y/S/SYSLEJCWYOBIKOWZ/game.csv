"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will pay dividends for you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you first. Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,
