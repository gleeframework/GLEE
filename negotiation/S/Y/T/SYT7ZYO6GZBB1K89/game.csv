"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
