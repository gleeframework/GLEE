Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value of $1,000,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows both of us to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 6 rounds left, so I'll counteroffer again. If he refuses, I'm getting close to the point where selling to John for $1,200,000 becomes the safer option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.  Let's agree and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,087,500. This price is a compromise that allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the highest he's made so far, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. We're approaching the point where selling to John becomes the safer option. With 4 rounds left, I'll counteroffer again, but I'm ready to accept John's offer if this next round fails."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. It's getting very close to the point where I'll have to consider other options.  I'm willing to come down to $1,112,500 as my final offer. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further delays."", ""product_price"": 1112500}
