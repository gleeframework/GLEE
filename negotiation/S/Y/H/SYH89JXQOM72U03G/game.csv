"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your consideration of my product. While I understand your perspective, I am unable to meet you at $100. My valuation of the product is higher, and I believe we can find a middle ground. How about we aim for $115? This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $108 for the product? This seems to be a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",108.0,Alice,5,
