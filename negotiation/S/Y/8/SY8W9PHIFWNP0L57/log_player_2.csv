"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum price and John's offer. It's reasonable to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me, though. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This gives you room to move upwards during the bargaining process. 
* **Significant Difference:** Alice's starting price is very high. A counteroffer significantly lower shows you're serious about a better deal but also leaves room for compromise.
* **Polite and Open:**  Maintaining a positive and open tone is important in negotiations. You want to encourage Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I'm willing to adjust to find common ground.  Could you consider $1,850,000?  This offer reflects my desire to reach a deal while acknowledging the inherent value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still significantly higher than your target price and John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,850,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,350,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards the Middle:** By suggesting a price close to the midpoint between your previous offer and her current one, you signal a willingness to compromise but hold firm on getting a significant discount.
* **Stronger Language:**  Instead of just saying it's ""a little steep,"" you're making a more definitive statement about what you're willing to pay. 
* **Justification:**  You're offering a reason for your counteroffer (""fair offer that reflects the value""), which can help move the negotiation forward."
