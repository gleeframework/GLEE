"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,000,000 falls significantly short of what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,175,000. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and while $1,175,000 is a decent offer, John's guaranteed $1,200,000 avoids further negotiation and potential risk of losing both offers."
