"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,000,000 falls significantly short of what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,175,000. Would you consider this price?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
