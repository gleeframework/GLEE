I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point given that the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000.

``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,425,000.  This is a good price, considering I could sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob for a better price, but the risk of losing the deal is increasing, and I'd rather secure the sale."
