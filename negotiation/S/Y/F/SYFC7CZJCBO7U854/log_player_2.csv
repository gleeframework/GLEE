{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, but I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the counter-offer process and potentially save money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, the value this product brings to the table is undeniable. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a significant improvement from her first offer, it's still too high for my comfort level. I believe I can still push for a better price and potentially save more money. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits I see in this product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your budget concerns.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is still within my budget and significantly less than John's asking price of $1,200,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice walking away or me running out of rounds.  At this point, it's in my best interest to accept her offer and secure the product."
