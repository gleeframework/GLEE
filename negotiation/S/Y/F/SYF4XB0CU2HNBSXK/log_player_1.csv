"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential compromise.
* **Emphasis on value:**  My message highlights the potential value of the product for Bob's business. This can make him more inclined to consider a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I clearly state that I'm open to negotiation, signaling that a deal is possible. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  I have a backup plan with John, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at any price.  This gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I'm hoping to get.
* **More negotiation room:**  I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price.
* **Leveraging John:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to keep negotiating.  

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,280,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000, but that's as far as I can go.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1320000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000 was too high, but I'm willing to consider $1,290,000. Can we meet at this price?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come closer, but $1,290,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,310,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1310000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing the gap:** I'm reducing my price again, but only slightly, demonstrating a continued willingness to negotiate while still maintaining leverage. 
* **Highlighting concessions:** I emphasize that this is a ""significant concession"" on my part, making Bob more likely to see this as a final offer. 
* **Focusing on value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to reconsider his position.
* **Urgency:**  I suggest we ""close this deal,"" creating a sense of urgency and prompting Bob to act.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can we call it a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  His offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited rounds left:** With only two rounds remaining, I don't have much time to negotiate further. 
* **Guaranteed higher price:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,500,000.  This is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

It's better to take the secure, higher offer from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
