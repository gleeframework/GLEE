Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I need to recoup some of my initial investment.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value to you and the fact that I'm taking a loss. Let's make this happen!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While I'd love to accept your offer, I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $9,250? It's a compromise, and a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
