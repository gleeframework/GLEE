"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I need to recoup some of my initial investment.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value to you and the fact that I'm taking a loss. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While I'd love to accept your offer, I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $9,250? It's a compromise, and a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!",9250.0,Alice,5,
