"Bob, I understand you're looking to spend $8,000, and I appreciate your interest. However, I need to get closer to my asking price to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This gives us both a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I'm really not comfortable going lower than $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
