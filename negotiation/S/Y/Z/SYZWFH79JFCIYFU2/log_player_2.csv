**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above your ideal price, it's now within your budget.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's likely to be time-consuming and there's no guarantee of a better price.  Buying from Alice at $1,125,000 saves you time and allows you to secure the product."
