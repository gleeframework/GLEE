"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a good price point that considers your budget and my investment in the product. Let's finalize this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
