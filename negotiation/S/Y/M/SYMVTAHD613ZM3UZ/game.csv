"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $140? I believe this is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $137.50? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle.  However, $137.50 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $142.50 as a final offer. This is a great price for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think.",142.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $142.50, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to meet you at $139. Would you be willing to accept that price?",139.0,Bob,6,
