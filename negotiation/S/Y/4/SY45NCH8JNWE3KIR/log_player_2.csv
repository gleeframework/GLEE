"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12,000? This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her to lower the price further."
