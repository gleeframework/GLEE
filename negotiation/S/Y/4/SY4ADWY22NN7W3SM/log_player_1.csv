Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to make a special deal just for you today, offering it at $14,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's value is $8,000, Alice is unaware of his negotiation limits. Starting with a price closer to her own value ($14,000) leaves room for potential negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" and ""Special Deal"":**  This phrasing creates a sense of scarcity and value, potentially encouraging Bob to consider the offer more seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility by using phrases like ""willing to make a deal."" This invites Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price too high.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Bob might outright reject this initial high price without counter-offering. However, since Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, she can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Information is Key:** In a real negotiation, observing Bob's reactions and responses to this initial offer would be crucial for Alice to adjust her strategy in subsequent turns."
