"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Can we discuss further?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a similar price point. Let me know your decision.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
