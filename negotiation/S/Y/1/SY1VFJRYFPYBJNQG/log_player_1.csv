Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's well within my budget and still gives you a decent profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a decent profit, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I have several rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,075,000? This would be a good middle ground and allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not ideal. I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'm also mindful that I have the option to sell to John if I'm not satisfied with Bob's counteroffers."
