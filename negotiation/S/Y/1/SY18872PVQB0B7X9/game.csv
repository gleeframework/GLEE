"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. How about $100? That's a significant discount, and I think it's a good compromise.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $100 is better, it's still a bit higher than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That feels like a fair deal to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
