Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still significantly more than I had in mind. I could potentially consider something closer to $800,000.  Would that be within the realm of possibility? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

We're getting closer to Bob's valuation, but we're still far from our minimum. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter.  I see you're serious about this product.  To be frank, $800,000 is a little too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the value of what's on the table."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. While $1,350,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to something around $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

We are moving closer, but $950,000 is still significantly less than our minimum acceptable price. Let's counter offer again and see if we can get closer to at least $1,100,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  However, to be completely transparent, anything above $1,000,000 would be very difficult for me to justify.  Could you meet me at that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's time to cut our losses. Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to meet our minimum price. Accepting his offer at $1,000,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  We're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John at this point."
