"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm aiming for a higher figure, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise and recognizes the inherent value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still significantly more than I had in mind. I could potentially consider something closer to $800,000.  Would that be within the realm of possibility?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I see you're serious about this product.  To be frank, $800,000 is a little too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the value of what's on the table.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. While $1,350,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to something around $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  However, to be completely transparent, anything above $1,000,000 would be very difficult for me to justify.  Could you meet me at that price point?",1000000.0,Bob,8,
