"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is way above what I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $8,000 is far too low for me. I'm going to try to get a better price from him in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $8000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I know I can get more than $8,000. I'll see if I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to go as low as $13,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $13000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm going to reject it. $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a good price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $11500 is still pushing it.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

With only three rounds left, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000.  I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and we're not close enough on price. It's better to take the sure thing than to risk getting nothing at all."
