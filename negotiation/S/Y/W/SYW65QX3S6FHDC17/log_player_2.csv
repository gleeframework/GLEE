"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a bit lower than her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer or allows you to proceed with your backup plan."
