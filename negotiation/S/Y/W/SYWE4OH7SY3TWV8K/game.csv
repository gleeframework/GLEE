"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly special.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems great, but your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about buying your product. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
