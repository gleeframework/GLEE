"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above his maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $7,500? "", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing his willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer is still within his budget while giving Alice some room to counter if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $8000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,000 is now at Bob's maximum budget.  While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will refuse and he might end up paying more to John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, ensuring he gets the product while staying within his budget."
