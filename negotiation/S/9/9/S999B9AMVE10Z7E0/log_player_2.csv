"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd really find it useful. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $80. It's more sensible to reject her offer and see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a pretty good deal for this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $80. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product, and I want to be fair.  Let's make this our final price: $105.  It's a steal for this quality, and it avoids us going back and forth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $80.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already gone through 5 rounds. It's likely we'll be going back and forth for a while longer. It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $80, guaranteeing a deal within my budget and saving time."
