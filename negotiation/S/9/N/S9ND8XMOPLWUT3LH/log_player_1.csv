Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a fair and competitive offer. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and it's our minimum acceptable price, starting higher allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, framing the higher price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Why not ask for more?**  While we could start even higher, there's a risk of alienating Bob and having him reject the offer outright. This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism."
