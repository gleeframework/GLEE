"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to compromise at $142.50, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good discount from the original price.",142.5,Alice,5,

I'm not sure $142.50 is a good deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $137.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?,137.5,Bob,6,
