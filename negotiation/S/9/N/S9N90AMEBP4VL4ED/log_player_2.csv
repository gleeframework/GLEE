{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save money, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John for $1,200,000.  There's a chance you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This is a bold move, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and potentially pushes Alice towards a more reasonable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $950,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but also demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise. This is a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and her latest offer, increasing the likelihood of an agreement."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,000,000.  This shows Alice that I'm flexible but still determined to negotiate. I'm hopeful this will entice Alice to meet me in the middle, especially as we have fewer rounds left."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Alice's offer is getting close to my desired price point. While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting her offer at $1,080,000 is a good compromise that saves me $120,000 compared to buying from John.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might raise her price or we won't reach an agreement before I have to buy from John. It's better to take this opportunity and secure the product at a lower cost."
