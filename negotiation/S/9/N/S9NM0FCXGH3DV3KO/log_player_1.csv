{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price:**  $1,200,000 is still well above what Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I can still make concessions if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It shows I'm serious about selling:**  By making a concrete offer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to engage.

However,  I'll be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low or if negotiations drag on too long. John's offer of $1,500,000 is a valuable backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for so far below my value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 
 
This counteroffer:

* **Maintains a significant margin:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer, indicating that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Demonstrates flexibility:**  I've shown a willingness to compromise by reducing my initial asking price.
* **Sets a clear expectation:** By stating my counteroffer, I'm encouraging Bob to make a more serious offer.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to consider my options carefully. If his next offer is still too low, I might choose to sell to John for $1,500,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my last offer to see if we can find a compromise.  If Bob isn't willing to budge further, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** I've met Bob halfway by lowering my price from $1,100,000.
* **Maintains a reasonable margin:** $1,075,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on value.
* **Sets a clear expectation:** This counteroffer gives Bob a clear final price point to consider. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John for $1,500,000.  I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk negotiating too long and losing out on a sure deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but no higher. Can you accept this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go any higher than $1,050,000.  While that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not comfortable selling for so far below my value.  I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, so I'm going to sell to him."
