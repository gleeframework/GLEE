"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is still fair considering the potential value to me and allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value of the product to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better price to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise that should be fair to both of us, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price is fair considering our previous discussions, and it allows us both to make a decent deal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000. However, I still need to get a better price to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
