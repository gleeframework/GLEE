"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point you've presented is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $500,000. I believe this represents a fair offer, recognizing both the product's potential and my budgetary constraints.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $500,000  significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,500,000 is closer to a reasonable range, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?  I feel this represents a significant compromise and would allow us to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This offer reflects my desire to strike a deal while ensuring a fair valuation for this unique product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
