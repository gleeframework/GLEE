"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $140, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $155? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to what I need to make on the sale.",155.0,Alice,5,
