"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than $12,000, you have room to negotiate a lower price. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so you can likely get it for closer to that value.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I see the value in this product, I'm looking to get it for a bit closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go down to $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a lower price than the initial offer, you still have room for negotiation and are closer to your target price of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter again, potentially getting a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high.  How about we settle on $8,750? It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $9,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate but is unlikely to go lower than $9,200.  You're close to your target range, and accepting the offer saves you from further negotiation and the risk of Alice walking away entirely. Buying from John would cost you $12,000, making Alice's offer the better choice."
