"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $135 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening offer but still gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $120 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $115?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. Let's see if we can push a little further before accepting.  We're still well within our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our last counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
