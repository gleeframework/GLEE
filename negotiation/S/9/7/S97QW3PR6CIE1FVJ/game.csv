"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit rich for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
