Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $15000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I've already made multiple counteroffers and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn.  John is a guaranteed $12,000, so it's time to move on."
