"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's a more reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
