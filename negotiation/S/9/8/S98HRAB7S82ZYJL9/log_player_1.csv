{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above Bob's valuation but below your minimum acceptable price.  It leaves room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing you to potentially close the deal at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at the lower end of what you're willing to accept, it's still better than selling to John for $120. It's worthwhile to see if you can close the deal at a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
