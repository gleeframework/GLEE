,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is considerably below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you place on it and my budget limitations. Let's make this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
