"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a good price, it's still significantly higher than your ideal target. You can likely secure a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $600,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $500,000.  Let's see if we can bridge that gap. "", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial interest. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $550,000, which is a good price and within your budget.  It's a significant discount from her original offer and is getting closer to your ideal price.  While you could potentially negotiate further, it's likely you won't get much lower and there's a risk that Alice will walk away.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise and ensures you get the product without the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
