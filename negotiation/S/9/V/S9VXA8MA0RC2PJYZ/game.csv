"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $600,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $500,000.  Let's see if we can bridge that gap. ",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial interest. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",550000.0,Alice,3,
