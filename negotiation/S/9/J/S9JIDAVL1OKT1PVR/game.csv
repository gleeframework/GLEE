"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1,075,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can make it work.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
