"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that I've put a lot of effort into, and I know you'll appreciate its potential. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value it offers.  Consider this a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
