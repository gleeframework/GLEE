"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit far from my desired price point.  To make this work, I'd need to see $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your latest offer, but unfortunately, it still exceeds my budget. I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise. This amount reflects the value I believe the product holds for me while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from a price that works for me.  To make this deal happen, I'd need to see $1,025,000.  It's a fair amount that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've evaluated your latest proposal, and while I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet your requested price. I am willing to offer $1,010,000 for the product. This amount is a reasonable compromise between our positions and should allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
