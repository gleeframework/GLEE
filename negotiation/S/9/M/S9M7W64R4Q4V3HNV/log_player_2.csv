"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $100 to you. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I'm extending this exclusive offer to you at a special price of $95. This is an opportunity to secure a high-value item at a discounted rate. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice is clearly inflating the perceived value of the product. While her offer of $95 is slightly better than John's $100, it's still above your $100 limit. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer or can proceed to buy from John at your maximum price."
