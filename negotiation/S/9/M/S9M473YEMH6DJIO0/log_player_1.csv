Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to make a profit, I'm not willing to accept such a low price right away.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,800 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,800 is only slightly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a good deal considering I could sell to John for $15,000. I'll accept it to close the deal and avoid further negotiations."
