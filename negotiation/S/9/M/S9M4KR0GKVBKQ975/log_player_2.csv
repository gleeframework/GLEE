"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I know you're interested in, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while also giving you a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. However, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice by rejecting this initial offer."
