{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's better to secure a sale at the minimum acceptable price than to potentially lose the deal entirely."
