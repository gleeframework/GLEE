"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $775,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives you a good deal. Let's reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to pay $790,000, which is my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",790000.0,Bob,6,
