"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room for negotiation while still leaving a significant profit for myself. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob in my message, hoping to make him more motivated to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I have enough rounds left to keep negotiating and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $775,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives you a good deal. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to pay $790,000, which is my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better deal from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the best course of action."
