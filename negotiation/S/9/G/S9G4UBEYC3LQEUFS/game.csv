"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm hoping to get it for a bit less, though. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I think my initial offer of $14,000 was already quite competitive. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13,500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
