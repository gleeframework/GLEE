"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering your value for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low. I'm happy to meet you in the middle,  How about $10,000?  This is a fair price that considers both our perspectives. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me, but $10,000 is still a bit high.  How about $9,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both our needs, and it's the highest I can go at this time.",9000.0,Bob,4,
