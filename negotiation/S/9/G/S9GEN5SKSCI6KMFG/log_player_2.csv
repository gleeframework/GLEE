"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or go with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low. I'm happy to meet you in the middle,  How about $10,000?  This is a fair price that considers both our perspectives. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
