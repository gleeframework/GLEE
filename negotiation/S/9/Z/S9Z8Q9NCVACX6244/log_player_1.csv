Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling for above $13,000 is still a better outcome than selling to John for $12,000. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
