"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to keep the investment at a certain level. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this price still represents a great value for the benefits you'll receive.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere around $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a real willingness from both of us to get this deal done, and I respect your budget constraints. Let's make this happen. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000, which is my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while hopefully addressing your investment goals.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
