"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current positions.
