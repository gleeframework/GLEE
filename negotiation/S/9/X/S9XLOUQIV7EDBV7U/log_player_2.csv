"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a subsequent offer, allowing you to save even more."
