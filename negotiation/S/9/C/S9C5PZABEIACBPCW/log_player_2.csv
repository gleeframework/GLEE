Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way to $105, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $115. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and while we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is becoming marginal. Accepting at $110 secures a decent deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
