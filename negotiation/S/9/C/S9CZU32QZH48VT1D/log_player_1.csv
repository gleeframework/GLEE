Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While we could push for a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting $105 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away, forcing us to sell to John at our minimum."
