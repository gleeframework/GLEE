"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above his target of $15,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm only able to offer $12,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's original price, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for negotiation.  By starting at a lower price, Bob hopes to entice Alice to come down further while keeping the possibility of a deal open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm hoping for something closer to $13,500.  This product offers you significant value, and I believe this price is a fair reflection of that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still above Bob's preferred price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can get Alice closer to his target of $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again making a counteroffer, but this time he's coming up slightly to $13,000, showing flexibility. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, suggesting a willingness to compromise, and hopefully, it will persuade Alice to accept. It's important to keep in mind that Bob's goal is to get the lowest price, but he also needs to be reasonable to reach a deal."
