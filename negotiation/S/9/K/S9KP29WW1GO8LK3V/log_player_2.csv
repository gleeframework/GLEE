Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's try to find a middle ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $725,000 is a step in the right direction.  Let's split the difference and settle on $787,500.  This allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for finalizing this agreement.

At this point, Alice is very slowly coming down in price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get her much below John's price of $800,000.  It's time to cut bait and buy from John."
