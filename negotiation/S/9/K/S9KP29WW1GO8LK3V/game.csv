"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $725,000 is a step in the right direction.  Let's split the difference and settle on $787,500.  This allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for finalizing this agreement.",787500.0,Alice,5,
