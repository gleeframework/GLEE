"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance the efficiency and profitability of your operations. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $12,000 to you. Considering its true worth and the benefits it offers, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for $14,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between its market value and the cost to me, ensuring we both benefit from this transaction. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at your target price. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
