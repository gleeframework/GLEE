"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a fair price. How about $1,400,000? It's a significant discount from the value you see in it.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that's fair for both of us. Let's try $1,250,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to be satisfied.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.  How about $1,260,000? This is a reasonable price that shows we're both committed to making this deal happen.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
