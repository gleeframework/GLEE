"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product brings to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1250000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to save a bit more. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1275000. Can you consider that?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the price I'd be willing to accept from John, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm going to make one more offer, and that's $1290000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1290000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make one last counteroffer of $1275000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept the offer.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that $1290000 is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession. I'll meet you at $1280000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a firm offer, and I expect you to accept it.",1280000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1280000. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $1250000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept the offer.",1250000.0,Bob,10,
