"I've already offered $122, and you're reverting back to $125. I'm not sure I'm willing to go back to that price. How about we meet in the middle at $123? That's as close as I'm willing to get to $125.",123.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to meet you at $123, Bob. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm willing to go back to my original offer of $130. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell the product to you at that price. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers.",130.0,Alice,9,
