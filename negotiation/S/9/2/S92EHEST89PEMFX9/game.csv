"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $200 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to work with.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm firm on my offer of $80. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I might have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $140. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my limits. Let me know if you're ready to accept.",80.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $80. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $130. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",130.0,Alice,7,
