"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,000,000, so I'm offering $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
