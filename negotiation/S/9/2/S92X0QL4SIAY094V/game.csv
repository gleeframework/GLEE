"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,000? That's a significant drop from your previous offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit higher than your target, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to drop the price to $10,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,5,
