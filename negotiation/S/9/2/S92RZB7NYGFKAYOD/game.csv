"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get closer to the true value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
