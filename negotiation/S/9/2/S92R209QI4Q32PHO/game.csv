"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm thinking a price closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify a price that high.  How about we settle on $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm proposing a new counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
