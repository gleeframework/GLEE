"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm proposing a new counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging significantly from her initial offers. Her latest offer of $1,250,000 is too close to John's price of $1,500,000. It's unlikely further negotiation with Alice will yield a price difference worth the time and effort.  It's more practical to accept John's guaranteed offer."
