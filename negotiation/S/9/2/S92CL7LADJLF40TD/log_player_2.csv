"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget ($1,200,000), and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal you're offering, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's well below his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer saves him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and he'd end up paying more by going to John."
