The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $175. That's way too high. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm willing to pay the maximum I'm comfortable with, which is $80.  Let's see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $125 is still too high for me.  While it's better than her initial offer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  John is offering the product for my maximum price, so I'll go with him."
