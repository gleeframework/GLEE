Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still leaving room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $80, this price is likely to be rejected, but it gives me a good starting point to gauge his interest and see where his counteroffer falls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low for me. It's worth $150 to me minimum, and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125, still above my minimum but significantly closer to Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while also making it clear I'm not willing to accept his initial offer."
