# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that is fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1250000. This gives you a significant saving and ensures I receive a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
