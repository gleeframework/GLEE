"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $8,000."
