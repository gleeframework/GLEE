"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to maximize my profit while still potentially reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to $11,000 or potentially even higher.  The risk of losing the deal with Bob is less significant than selling the product for a much lower price than I'm willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500. This is a significant compromise, demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to $10,500 or potentially even higher.  I still believe there's a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price, and selling to John for $15,000 is still my priority."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $10,250. This shows a continued willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway.  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still giving me a profit that is closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only three rounds left and Bob's offers consistently below my minimum desired price, it's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of running out of time without reaching an acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with no deal at all."
