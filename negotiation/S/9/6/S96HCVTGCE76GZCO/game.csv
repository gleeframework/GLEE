"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $140 to make this worthwhile. How about $145? It's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $145 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $145, which would be $132.50. Can you consider that?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and your last offer of $132.50. How about $136.25? This would allow us both to get a fair deal.",136.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $132.50 and $136.25, which would be $134.375. However, I'd like to round it down to $134. Can we meet at $134?",134.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I'm willing to come down to $138.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let me know if you're interested.",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $134 and $138, which would be $136. I'd like to make a final offer of $136. Can we meet at this price?",136.0,Bob,8,
