"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to offer $13000 for it.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price, but $16000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm not comfortable going over $14000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $15500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it, and it's still a bit above your original offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $14500.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and would get us closer to a deal.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $14800. It's a bit above your latest offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway to get a deal done. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14800.0,Alice,7,
