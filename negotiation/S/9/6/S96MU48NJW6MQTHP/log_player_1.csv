"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150 to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic:** I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his estimated value of $80, especially if he's interested in the product.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested but would like to negotiate the price. How about $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:** While I could sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $155?  This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer, highlighting the value for Bob and my need to earn a profit.
* **Staying Optimistic:**  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further room for negotiation:** I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to counter-offer.
* **Time constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to secure a sale.
* **Equal value:** While I could sell to John for the same price, this deal feels more satisfying as it's a successful negotiation with Bob."
