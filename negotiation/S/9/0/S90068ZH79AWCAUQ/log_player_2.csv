"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to let it go for $12000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though you value the product at $15,000, Alice is offering it for $12,000. This is a significant savings.
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer.** You're not given any information suggesting you can get a better price later on. 

It's always best to take advantage of a good deal when it's available!"
