"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you do $7,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
