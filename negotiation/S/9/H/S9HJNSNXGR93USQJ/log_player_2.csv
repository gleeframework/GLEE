"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much as possible, and $1,100,000 is still above your target.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $950,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high. You can continue to negotiate, aiming to get closer to your target of $1,000,000 or below."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a good price for the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I was thinking that $1,000,000 is still a bit below the product's true value to you. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice claims this is her final offer, you still have time to negotiate and there's a chance she might budge.  $1,075,000 is still a bit too high, so reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to make a fair profit, but $1,075,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,025,000, which is $1,050,000. I'm hoping this is a price that we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is offering a ""meet in the middle"" solution, you are still aiming for a lower price. You can continue to negotiate and potentially get closer to your target price. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and make a counteroffer that gets you closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,037,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,072,500. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,072,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,072,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached the end of your negotiation with Alice, and while you have one more round to counteroffer,  you're only $27,500 away from John's offer.  It's unlikely that Alice will come down enough in the next round to make it worthwhile.  It's better to buy from John at $1,200,000 than to risk going another round with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
