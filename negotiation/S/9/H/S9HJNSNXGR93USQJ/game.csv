"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $950,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a good price for the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I was thinking that $1,000,000 is still a bit below the product's true value to you. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a fair profit, but $1,075,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,025,000, which is $1,050,000. I'm hoping this is a price that we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
