"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's find a way to make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
