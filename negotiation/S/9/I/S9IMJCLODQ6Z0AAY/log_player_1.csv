{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a good profit.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. I'm also emphasizing that this is a good deal for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and leave room for negotiation. By starting at $1,000,000, I can potentially get closer to the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000) without risking losing the deal entirely.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter and try to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for me to get more.  I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that's closer to my ideal. It's a risk, as Bob could walk away, but I believe I have a better chance of getting a more favorable deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $950,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my appreciation for Bob's interest and making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm also highlighting the benefits of a compromise for both parties. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price halfway between the two previous offers, I'm showing flexibility while still maintaining a strong bargaining position. This approach encourages Bob to consider my offer as a reasonable compromise, making it more likely that we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $900,000, so I'm thinking $925,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is slightly lower than my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me.  Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and his offer is only $25,000 away from my last counteroffer.  Accepting this offer will ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a failed deal.

**Strategy:**

My strategy here is to prioritize a quick sale and secure a decent profit. While I could try to push for a higher price, the potential for further negotiation is too risky, especially considering my minimum acceptable price is $800,000."
