{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000. It's a steal at this price, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $8500? It's a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $8,500 is a good deal and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob.  It's also more than I would get from John."
