"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10000. It's a steal at this price, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to start by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, and the option to buy from John for $10,000 is always available as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significant discount, showing a willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating a serious interest in the product. It gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured into a major concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down $1,000, which is a good start, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. With 8 rounds left, I can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $8,500? It's a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a slight increase from my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price.  It creates a middle ground for Alice to consider while remaining within my budget.  With multiple rounds left, there's room for further negotiation."
