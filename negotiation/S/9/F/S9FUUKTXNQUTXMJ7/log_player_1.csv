Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I know it's valued at a million dollars, and for a limited time, I'm willing to let it go for $1,900,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a much higher price ($1,900,000) sets a strong anchor. Even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value, it creates room for negotiation and makes a lower offer seem more appealing later.
* **Scarcity and Urgency:**  Phrases like ""limited time"" and ""unique opportunity"" introduce scarcity and urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. This allows you to be bold in your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on maximizing potential profit. There's a chance Bob could reject the initial offer outright. However, it sets the stage for a potential counter-offer and negotiation towards a price higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
