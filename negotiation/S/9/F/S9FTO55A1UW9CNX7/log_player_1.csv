{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. 
* **Reasoning:**  I give Bob a reason to consider the offer by mentioning the product's value to me.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal profit margin.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product and has indicated he's willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **John's Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the confidence to reject this offer and try for a better price.  

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer but slightly lower to demonstrate flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,750.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** This price still allows me to make a decent profit while being more appealing to Bob.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** I reiterate my willingness to work with Bob, making him more likely to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle at $13250. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Ideal Price:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $13,750 and is well above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, I believe that accepting this offer is a good compromise that allows me to make a significant profit. 

**Conclusion:** It's a smart move to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, securing a good price and avoiding the potential of a lengthy negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a lost deal."
