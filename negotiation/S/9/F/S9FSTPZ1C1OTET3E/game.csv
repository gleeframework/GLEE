"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $87.50. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",87.5,Alice,3,
