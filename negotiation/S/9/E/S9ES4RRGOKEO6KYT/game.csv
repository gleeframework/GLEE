Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I think $16000 is too low for this product. I'll offer it to you for $16250, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",16250.0,Alice,9,
