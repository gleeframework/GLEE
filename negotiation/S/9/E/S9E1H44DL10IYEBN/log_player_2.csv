Alice is getting closer to her actual value, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. We're getting into the later rounds, so I'll need to start being more assertive to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be realistic with your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I can offer it to you for $7,950. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down quite a bit and is very close to her value.  This is a good price, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose the deal entirely."
