# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $22,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This reflects its quality and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
