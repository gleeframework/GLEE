"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $22,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This reflects its quality and the benefits it will bring you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
