"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $15,000.
* Alice is offering it for $14,000, which is a good deal, but you can still do better.
* You have a fallback option with John at $15,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you create leverage. Alice might lower her price to secure the sale, or you can go with John."
