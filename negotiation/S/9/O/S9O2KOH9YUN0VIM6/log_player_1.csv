"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,750. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, but is also more attractive to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,400.  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations and I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob.  It's a good price and I'm  happy to secure the sale."
