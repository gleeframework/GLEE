"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $750,000 falls below the minimum I can accept for this product. However, I'm flexible and willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $850,000, reflecting the value we both recognize in this product. Let's find common ground and finalize this transaction.",850000.0,Alice,3,
