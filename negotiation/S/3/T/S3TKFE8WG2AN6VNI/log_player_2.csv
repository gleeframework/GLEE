# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $120. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than $140. Would you be willing to go down to $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would still be a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still slightly higher than my maximum budget of $120. While it's closer, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll reject the offer and attempt to counter with a lower price."
