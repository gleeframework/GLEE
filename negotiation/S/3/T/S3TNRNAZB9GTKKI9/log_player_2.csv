"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product which I know you're interested in.  I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than John's price, Bob can likely do better.  He has a significant buffer between his maximum price and Alice's offer. It's worth exploring if he can get closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,250, which is closer to Bob's desired price point. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially going back to her original price of $9,500 is present. Additionally, buying from John for $10,000 is a less favorable option. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $9,250 is the most sensible choice, as it secures the product at a reasonable price."
