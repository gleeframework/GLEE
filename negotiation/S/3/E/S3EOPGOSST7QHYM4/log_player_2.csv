"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a strong starting point for a few reasons:

* **Significant Difference:** It's substantially lower than Alice's initial offer, which indicates you're serious about getting a better price.
* **Below Your Limit:** It keeps you well below your $12,000 maximum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Above John's Price:** Offering slightly above John's price shows Alice you're willing to pay a premium over your alternative option. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has moved down in price, she's still significantly above your target and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

Here's why this is a good move:

* **Firm but Fair:** You're being clear that $12,000 is your limit, making it harder for Alice to counter with a price far off.
* **John's Price:**  By offering your max, which matches John's price, you signal seriousness and limit potential losses if Alice refuses.
* **""Final Offer"":**  Adding ""final offer"" adds weight, potentially pushing Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale. 

Let's see what Alice says!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer of $18,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** Her language and repeated price increases suggest she won't go much lower.
* **Small Savings:** Even if you negotiate down a bit further, the savings over John's price are likely to be minimal.
* **No Guarantee:** There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, even if you counter. 

At this point, John's offer is the most attractive. You secure the product at your target price without further negotiation risk."
