Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $1,500,000, setting a strong floor for her negotiation. She starts high to leave room for potential negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product, subtly suggesting it's worth more than Bob might initially think.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning ""limited-time"" and ""other interested parties,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, pushing Bob to make a decision.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it's not an outrageous markup from Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price that's still very profitable for Alice."
