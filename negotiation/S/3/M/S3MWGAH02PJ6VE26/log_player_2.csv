"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's still potential to negotiate further and get a better deal.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully achieve a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $920,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $880,000. It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I see you're serious, so I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price again, Bob is still able to get a better deal.  He can still negotiate for a lower price, and it's worth trying to see if Alice will budge further.  Rejecting allows for another round of negotiation and could potentially lead to a final price closer to Bob's target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value you're putting on this product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget. I believe this is a good compromise and hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 890000}
