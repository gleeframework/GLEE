Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a new one, hoping to close the gap a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair deal and I'm happy to accept it.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price and I risk losing the deal altogether.  It's best to secure the sale at this point."
