"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is above his budget and he can get a better deal from either John or by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10500? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice is getting closer to his budget, $10,500 is still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10250}
