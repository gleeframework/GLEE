Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $9,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
