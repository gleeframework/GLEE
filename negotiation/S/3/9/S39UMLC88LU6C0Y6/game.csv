"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing this further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. I'm confident this product is worth a lot, but I'm unable to go any higher than that. Let me know if you're willing to discuss this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget limitations.  While the product is incredibly valuable to you, it represents a significant investment on my end, and $800,000 wouldn't make me whole.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This shows my genuine interest in the product, but it's the absolute maximum I can go. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
