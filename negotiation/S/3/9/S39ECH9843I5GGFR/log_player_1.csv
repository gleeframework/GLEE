Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I know I can always go down, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll try to meet Bob halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that encourages Bob to close the deal."
