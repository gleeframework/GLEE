"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too expensive to buy from Alice at this price. You can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so there's no need to accept Alice's offer. Rejecting gives you the chance to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This offer demonstrates your serious interest in buying the product while trying to reach a price that's more acceptable to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still slightly above the price you can get from John. Buying from John ensures you get the product for the lowest price possible."
