"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her product's worth to her, it's still more than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, Bob might be able to get the product for a price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for further negotiation. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A lower counteroffer helps understand how willing Alice is to negotiate and how close to $1,000,000 (John's price) she might be willing to go.
* **Potentially secure a better deal:**  There's a chance Alice might accept this offer, saving Bob a significant amount. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's space for Bob to gradually increase his offer while staying below his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,000,000?  This is a fair price that allows you to get a great value and me to get a fair deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met Bob's bottom line. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as John is already offering the product at $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at the best possible price."
