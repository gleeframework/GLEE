"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,075,000? I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
