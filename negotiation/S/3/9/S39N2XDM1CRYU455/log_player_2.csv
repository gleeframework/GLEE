"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,075,000? I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $1,000,000. However, he's already negotiated a significant discount from the original asking price of $1,100,000.  Accepting Alice's offer of $1,075,000 secures the product at a price that is still a good deal compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal altogether."
