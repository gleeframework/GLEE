"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, as this product holds a significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I believe this price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the value of the product, Alice. While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to do $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still below the product's true value. Let's compromise at $1,350,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our needs, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
