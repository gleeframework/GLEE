"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850000 for it, reflecting a fair price based on my valuation. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and also takes into account your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000. This price is a fair compromise given the product's value to both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $975000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account both our valuations of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, $975000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and it allows us to reach an agreement. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a price that's closer to my minimum valuation. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is a compromise between our last offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account your budget constraints.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still slightly above my budget. To close this deal, I'm prepared to offer $925000. This price reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer and represents a fair value for the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this final round of negotiations.",925000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that we're getting close to the final stretch, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price that's below $950000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm willing to meet you at $935000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and takes into account your budget constraints.",935000.0,Alice,9,
