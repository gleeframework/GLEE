"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This is a starting point for negotiation. It's important to start with a price that's  reasonable but also gives you room to negotiate.  $100 leaves some potential for both of us to find a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product at $120, and I can potentially get closer to that price with further negotiation.  Selling to John at this point would leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to go a bit higher to make this deal work. How about $90? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. How about $85? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  Accepting his offer will ensure I get a decent price while securing the deal."
