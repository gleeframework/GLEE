"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better opportunity elsewhere.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1450000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1550000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above $1570000.
