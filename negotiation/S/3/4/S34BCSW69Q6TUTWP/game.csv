"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than $12000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, but I'd love to find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
