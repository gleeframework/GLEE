"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know you've been interested in. It's a valuable asset that can bring significant benefits to your business. I'm starting with a price of $900,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my interest in the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you attribute to it. While I understand its significance, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000? That's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your financial considerations.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. This offers a reasonable compromise between our respective positions.",825000.0,Bob,4,
