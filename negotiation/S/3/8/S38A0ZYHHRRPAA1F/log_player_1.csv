"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $135, which is above Bob's perceived value of $120 but below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and potential counteroffers while still ensuring a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would result in a large loss. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but still showing interest by making a counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $135 to $120, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect for both parties."
