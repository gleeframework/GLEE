"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $10,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about we settle on $9,250? This would give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my spending limit.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to compromise and offer $9,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my original offer of $10,500.",9500.0,Alice,5,
