"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $10,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than what Bob wants to spend. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about we settle on $9,250? This would give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my spending limit."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to compromise and offer $9,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my original offer of $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $10,500 to $9,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price. However, Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible.  At this point, the price difference between Alice's offer and John's offer is significant enough that buying from John is the most financially beneficial option for Bob."
