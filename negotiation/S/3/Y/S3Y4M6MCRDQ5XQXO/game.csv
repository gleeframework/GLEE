"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1100000 for it. This is a fair price, considering I'm a serious buyer looking to make a deal quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1200000, which is my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've both invested in this negotiation.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
