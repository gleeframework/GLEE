"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $100. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I understand your perspective on the price. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $92. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to the value of the product as possible. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",92.0,Bob,4,
