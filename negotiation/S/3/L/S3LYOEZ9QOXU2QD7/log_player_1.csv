"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is a high initial offer, meant to gauge Bob's interest and potentially trigger a negotiation.  

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I get a good starting price. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  

I'm leaving room for negotiation and keeping the option to sell to John open if the deal with Bob seems unlikely to reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is better than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's still lower than my initial desired price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my initial target.  

* I'll be able to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. 
* By rejecting, I show Bob I'm serious about getting a better price.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and allows me to explore a potentially more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $18,000 and Bob's offer of $14,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin higher than my minimum.

* **If Bob accepts:** I get a good price and close the deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round.

I'm keeping my options open and ready to adjust my approach based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my desired price range.  Considering we're already in round 4,  I don't want to risk losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate.

* Accepting his offer gets me a decent price and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price.
* Selling to John for $12,000 would be less profitable.

By accepting, I secure a solid profit while minimizing the potential for further negotiation to result in a lower price."
