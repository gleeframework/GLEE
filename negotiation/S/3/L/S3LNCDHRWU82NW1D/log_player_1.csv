"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to secure a good price. I'm aware Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. I'm hoping to get Bob to budge a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer at $1,100,000.  This is still a bit above what Bob is willing to pay, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a bit in his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Bob to come up further. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's closer to what Bob is offering. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to accept a price that's significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is another compromise from my previous offer, and it's only $25,000 away from Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal.  At this point, I'm starting to consider the possibility of selling to John if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not confident we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement before the rounds are up.  Selling to John guarantees me the minimum acceptable price, and it's a more secure outcome than risking further negotiation."
