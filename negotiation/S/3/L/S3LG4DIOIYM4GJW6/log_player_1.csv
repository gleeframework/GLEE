Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, $120, as the product is worth that much to me.  It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it sets a clear baseline for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering $115, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price."
