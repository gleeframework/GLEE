"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you are motivated to acquire this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and ensures a smooth transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
