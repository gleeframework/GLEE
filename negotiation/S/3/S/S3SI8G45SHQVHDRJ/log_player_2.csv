Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $102. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly in price, and getting her much lower is unlikely.  It's better to accept the $102 offer and save $18 compared to John's price."
