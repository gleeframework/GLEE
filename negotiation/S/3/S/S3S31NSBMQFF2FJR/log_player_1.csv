Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a safe $1,000,000, Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This presents an opportunity to make a significantly larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,300,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **Bob:** Gets the product for $200,000 less than his perceived value.
    * **Alice:** Earns $300,000 more than selling to John.
* **First Refusal Advantage:** By giving Bob the first opportunity, Alice creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially motivating him to accept the offer."
