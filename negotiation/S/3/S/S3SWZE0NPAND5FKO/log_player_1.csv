Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while also staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better offer. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to reach a deal, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal to John if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our desired outcome."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,075,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000 for the product. I hope this helps move us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to settle. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm hoping to push for a price closer to $1,100,000. Selling to John at this point would be a good option, but I'm still optimistic about getting a better deal from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,060,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,065,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed your proposal carefully and I'd like to counter with a price of $1,062,500 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between the value of your product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is only $2,500 away from my counteroffer, I'm still hoping to push for a higher price. I have four rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. Selling to John would be a good option, but I'm still optimistic about getting a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and I'm seeing your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,062,500 is still a little lower than where I'd like to be.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $1,063,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1063750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Based on your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $1,063,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of your product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,063,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,063,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last two rounds and the difference in price between Bob's offer and my counteroffer is now only $750.  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, the risk of him walking away is high, especially considering he only moved $500 on his last offer.  John is a guaranteed sale for $1,200,000, so it's time to close the deal with him."
