"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our desired outcome.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,075,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000 for the product. I hope this helps move us closer to an agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and I'm seeing your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,062,500 is still a little lower than where I'd like to be.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $1,063,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",1063750.0,Alice,7,
