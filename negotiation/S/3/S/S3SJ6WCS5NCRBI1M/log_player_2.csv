"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
 
You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $13,000 is still more than the product is worth to you. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At $12,000, the product is still worth more to you than it is to Alice, and it's lower than what John is selling it for. Accepting this offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
