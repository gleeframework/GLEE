Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $125.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still lower than the product's value to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but also establishes a starting point that is advantageous to me. 
* **Being Friendly:**  Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my $125 asking price. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate further, which may encourage him to raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my last offer and Bob's offer shows willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $117.50 is still above my minimum price point, ensuring I get a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encouraging, hopefully leading to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  Bob's offer of $115 is only $2.50 away from my desired $117.50.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a risk that further negotiation might lead Bob to walk away, leaving me with the option of selling to John for a lower price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing the negotiation could take time and energy, which I can use to pursue other opportunities. 

Considering all these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice."
