"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth a significant amount to me.  I understand it holds value for you as well.  While my minimum asking price is $1,200,000, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a substantial discount from my minimum, reflecting the value I see in a potential partnership with you.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
