Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to make a deal with Bob before moving on to John.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that:

1. **Is significantly more attractive to Bob than his alternative (no deal).**
2. **Maximizes your profit without being so high that Bob rejects it.**

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it can significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Price Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's valuation, hinting at ""unique value proposition"" subtly acknowledges the product's worth to him. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other options"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome**

This offer gives Bob a substantial saving ($50,000) compared to his perceived value while netting you a $150,000 profit over your alternative. While there's always a chance Bob could try to negotiate further, this starting point reflects a strong understanding of your position and maximizes your chances of securing a favorable deal."
