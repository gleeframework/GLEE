"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $10000 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you and the opportunity to secure it now. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to save some money. Alice's offer of $10,000 is still a bit above my budget of $12,000. I'll reject the offer and see what else I can find.
