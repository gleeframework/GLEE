Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $11,500 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000), giving him room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This price allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a higher price for you.

Remember, the key is to find a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your own profit. Keep John's offer ($10,000) in mind as your fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price,  it's worth pushing for a bit more. 

* **Reasoning:**  You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Next Step:** A counteroffer will allow you to explore a price closer to your desired $11,500. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you demonstrate that you're committed to getting a better price while still showing flexibility in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Let's compromise at $10,500. This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your financial limitations. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway while still securing a profit higher than your minimum. 
* **Reasoning:**  $10,500 is a reasonable compromise,  offering Bob a significant discount from your previous offer while staying above your minimum.
* **Staying Flexible:** This counteroffer maintains the negotiation process, allowing for further discussion and potential adjustment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $9500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While it's tempting to continue negotiating with Bob,  his final offer of $9,500 falls below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  

* **Reasoning:**  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **Alternative:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I receive a guaranteed profit.

By selling to John, I eliminate the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob and secure a sale that meets my minimum financial requirements."
