"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$80 is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, which is what I could get from John. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is still a good price for me, and it's a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to increase his bid further. I have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still holding firm on the fact that the product is worth more than $100 to me.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum, but I have John who is also willing to buy for the same price. There are only 4 rounds left, and there is no guarantee Bob will increase his offer. It's better to be safe and secure the sale with John."
