"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1100000 is a good starting point,  I'm looking for a price closer to $1300000 to reflect the true value of this product. I believe it holds significant potential for you, and this price allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's continue our discussion to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This price is fair and allows us both to achieve a successful outcome. Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
