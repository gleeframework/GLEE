"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's potential and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,050,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  While $950,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
