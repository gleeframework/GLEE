"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for this product. Would you be open to considering a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $8,000, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the $8,000 price point.  While Alice has moved closer,  it's still not the ideal price for Bob.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target. How about $8,500?  It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,400. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the $8,000 price point. Although Alice has come down in price, it's still not the ideal price for Bob. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal. While he can buy from John for $8,000, Bob should try to get a better deal from Alice since there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to come in a little lower.  How about $9,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $9,200. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose a price of $9,150. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only three rounds left, and the price is still higher than his target of $8,000. While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and the risk of not reaching an agreement is increasing. 

Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price, saving him money and time compared to continuing negotiations."
