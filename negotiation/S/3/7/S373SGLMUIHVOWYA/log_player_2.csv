"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm passionate about, and I know it can be a real asset for your business.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its potential benefits. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice seems keen to sell and you have a better alternative with John at $15,000. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her perceived value of $8,000."
