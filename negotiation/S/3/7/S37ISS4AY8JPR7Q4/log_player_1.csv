{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a good fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that is higher than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then assess whether to lower the price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I believe I can get a better price than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can offer $108. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  $108 is a decent price and  Bob seems unwilling to budge further.  It's not worth risking losing the sale altogether and then having to sell to John for $120."
