Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting high leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $120.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
