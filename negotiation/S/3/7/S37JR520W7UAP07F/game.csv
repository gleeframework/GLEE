"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $925000? This gives us both a fair price to work with.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $900000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer $912500. This is a very fair price considering the value you're getting from the product. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway again, but I'm not sure $912500 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $890000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. While I appreciate your effort, $890000 is simply too low.  Let's try to be more realistic. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be more realistic, and I appreciate that. However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the product, and I'm willing to compromise one more time.",875000.0,Bob,8,
