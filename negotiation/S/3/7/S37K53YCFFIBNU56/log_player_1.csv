Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm looking to sell a valuable product that I think you'll be interested in.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it gives me some room to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
