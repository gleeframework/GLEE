"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, to be honest, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle on $775,000?  That seems like a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
