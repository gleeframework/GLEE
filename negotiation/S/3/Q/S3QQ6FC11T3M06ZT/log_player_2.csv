Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $80 is unfortunately below what I can accept, as the product is worth more to me than that.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
