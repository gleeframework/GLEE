# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer for today, let me know if it works for you. Otherwise, I'll consider other options.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle â€“ $1,050,000. This is a substantial discount from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what you're getting. Take some time to consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. However, it is closer than her previous offers. This indicates Alice is becoming more flexible, and Bob can potentially reach a deal within his budget with a few more rounds of negotiation. It's still better to try and negotiate a lower price than to buy from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can find common ground.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
