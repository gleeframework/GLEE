"Alice, your initial offer is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer for today, let me know if it works for you. Otherwise, I'll consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle â€“ $1,050,000. This is a substantial discount from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what you're getting. Take some time to consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can find common ground.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
