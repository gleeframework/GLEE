Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering it's worth the same to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is strategically placed. It starts with a high price but leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, potentially making him more likely to accept. This way, I can see if I can get more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, while still having the option to sell to John if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum.  I need to see if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know if this is acceptable."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still less than my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  At this point, I'm willing to accept and secure the sale.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely."
