"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $125 is less than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $125 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $110?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $115? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still get great value from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $115 is less than Bob's maximum of $150.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has already come down from $125, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.  $115 is likely a reasonable price for both parties.
* **Opportunity cost:** If Bob rejects, he risks Alice walking away or increasing her price.  Buying from John would be more expensive.

It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
