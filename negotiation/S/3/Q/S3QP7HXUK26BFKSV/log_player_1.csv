Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a strong safety net. Aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially gain an extra $5,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet in the middle, still exceeding your minimum price. 
* **Value Highlighting:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price.  

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject a higher offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
