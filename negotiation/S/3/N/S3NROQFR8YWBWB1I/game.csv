"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly exceptional. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1200000 is unfortunately beyond my budget at this time. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This represents a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
