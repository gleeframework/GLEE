"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, so starting significantly above both Bob's perceived value and your minimum creates room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The initial offer provides a cushion to gradually decrease the price in subsequent rounds, while still aiming to stay above your minimum selling point.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value and sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. My counteroffer is $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate further. John's offer provides a safety net, but you haven't exhausted your options with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and willingness to negotiate.
* **Significant Drop:** The decrease from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000 signals that you're willing to find a compromise.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's potential value reinforces its worth and justifies the higher price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still comfortably above your minimum, giving you room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
