"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us. I'm confident that you'll find this offer more reasonable and I look forward to hearing back from you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1350000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000. It's a fair price for this unique product, and I'm confident that we can come to an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
