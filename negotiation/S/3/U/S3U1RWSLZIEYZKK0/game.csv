"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're still a bit apart, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1550000.

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see some more movement from you. I'm counteroffering at $1525000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle. What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal yet. I'm making one final offer, and I need you to meet me at $1475000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm counting on us being able to make a deal. What's your final decision?",1475000.0,Alice,9,
