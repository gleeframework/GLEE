"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value ($120) than Bob's ($80). This gives me more room to negotiate.
* **Showing willingness to deal:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, indicating I'm not just trying to squeeze the maximum out of Bob. 
* **Room for compromise:** $100 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for both of us to adjust the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:**  $95 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $120.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is closer to my price point.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $120, there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations seems like the more logical choice at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $95 is closer to where I need to be,  I'm willing to go to $98 to make this deal work. This is a great deal for you, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this and get this product in your hands!"", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price, but still staying above my minimum value.
* **Building urgency:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" and ""finalizing"" the sale, adding a bit of urgency to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Fair offer:**  $98 is a reasonable middle ground that gives Bob a good price while allowing me to make a profit."
