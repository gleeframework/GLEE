Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $120, so offering it above that price is crucial. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $140 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially increasing your profit slightly.

By starting at $140, you strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
