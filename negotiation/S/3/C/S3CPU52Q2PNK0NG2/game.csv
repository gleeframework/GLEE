"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price that's significantly below its worth to you, and I get a good deal too. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  That would give you a good price and would still allow me to make a profit. ",8000.0,Alice,3,
