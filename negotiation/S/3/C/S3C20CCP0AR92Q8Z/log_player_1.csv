Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $5000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$5,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $5000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my value for this product. How about $12,000? It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$8,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, $8000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. To be honest, I'm getting closer to selling to John, but I'm willing to give you one more chance. Let's meet at $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
