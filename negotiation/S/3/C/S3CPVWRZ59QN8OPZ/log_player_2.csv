{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is way too high. It's more than double what the product is worth to you. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. This is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $14,000. This is my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's time to see if we can get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your potential profit."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. I value this product highly, and while I want to find a solution, I can't go as low as $8,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?  This is a generous offer, and I'm hoping you'll recognize the value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still not ideal. I'm going to see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
