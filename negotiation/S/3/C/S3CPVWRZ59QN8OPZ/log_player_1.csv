"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and offer it to you at $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. This is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $14,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your potential profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. I value this product highly, and while I want to find a solution, I can't go as low as $8,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?  This is a generous offer, and I'm hoping you'll recognize the value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is firmly rooted at $8,000 and slowly inching upwards.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $12,000 within the remaining rounds. Cutting my losses and taking the guaranteed $12,000 is the most logical choice."
