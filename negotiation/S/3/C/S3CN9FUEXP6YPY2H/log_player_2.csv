"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is too high.  You are trying to acquire the product for under $800,000, so it's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This reflects the product's worth to me, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is your maximum budget, but I believe the product's value to me is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target of under $800,000.  You should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $750,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still higher than your target price of under $800,000. While there are still rounds left, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation. You've already rejected two of Alice's offers and she seems unwilling to budge further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further potentially unsuccessful rounds of negotiation with Alice."
