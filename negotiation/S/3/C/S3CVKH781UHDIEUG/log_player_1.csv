{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm asking Bob what he thinks, signaling that I'm open to discussion and potentially lowering the price if necessary. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer.  Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy for subsequent offers or counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really like the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $70 is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. Therefore, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. $70 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a price of $85, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80 and also closer to Bob's offer.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm reinforcing Bob's interest in the product and expressing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value proposition of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open Ended Question:**  I'm asking Bob's opinion to gauge his interest and potentially spark further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $85 is a good price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'm happy to negotiate, I don't want to go below my floor. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $80, I'm going to choose to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
