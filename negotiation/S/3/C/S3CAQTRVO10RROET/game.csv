"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can meet you halfway between $100 and $120, so how about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I can meet you at $105, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. That way, we can both feel good about the deal.",115.0,Alice,5,,
