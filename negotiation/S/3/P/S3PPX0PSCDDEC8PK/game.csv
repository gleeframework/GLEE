"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $900000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $775000.

I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
