**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high ($130) compared to your maximum budget of $100. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You have 9 rounds left to reach an agreement."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $124. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $124
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only three rounds left, the negotiation isn't moving fast enough. Alice keeps offering prices above my budget, and it's unlikely she'll come down to a price I'm willing to pay in the remaining time.  Therefore, I'm going to buy the product from John for $100. This guarantees I get the product within my budget."
