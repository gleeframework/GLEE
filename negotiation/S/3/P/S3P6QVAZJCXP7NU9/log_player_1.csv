"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you establish a strong anchor. This sets the tone for the negotiation and potentially leads Bob to perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and ""substantial benefits"" helps justify the high initial price, even if these benefits are not explicitly stated.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $2,000,000 starting point provides ample room for negotiation over the remaining rounds. It allows you to make strategic concessions while still aiming for a final price significantly above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product might bring substantial benefits, but I'm looking to acquire it within a more reasonable budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). While his counter-offer was expected after the high anchor you set, accepting this would leave significant money on the table.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget considerations,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price point reflects both the product's value and my desire to see this deal through."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You made a substantial concession from your initial price ($2,000,000 to $1,700,000) demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, you remain significantly above both your minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's potential value reinforces your position that a lower price is not justifiable.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By positioning this offer as a ""middle ground,"" you subtly encourage Bob to make a counter-offer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I believe that's a fair offer that recognizes the product's value while fitting within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 exceeds your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Strong Position:**  You successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Time Value:**  While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now secures a favorable deal."
