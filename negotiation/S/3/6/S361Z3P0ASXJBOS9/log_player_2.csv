You can do better than $11,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  You're still $250 above your ideal price point, and there's room for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

Alice's offer of $11,200 is a good deal for you. It's less than what you're willing to pay from John, and it's closer to your ideal price.  Accepting this offer will help you save money and secure the product you're looking for."
