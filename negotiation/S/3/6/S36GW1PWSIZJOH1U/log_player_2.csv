"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $950,000 to you. We're confident this is a fair price given the value you'll receive from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your feedback. Based on our internal valuation and considering your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $900,000 for the product. We believe this offers a fair compromise between the perceived value and the cost of production and acquisition.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, and it's worth trying to get closer to my target range before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still above my target range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our assessment, we would like to propose a price of $890,000 for the product. We believe this offers a reasonable compromise that respects the value you place on the product while allowing us to achieve a satisfactory return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting close to my desired range. While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and the possibility of needing to buy from John at a much higher price ($1,200,000) makes accepting this offer the best option.  It's a good compromise that saves me significant money compared to buying from John."
