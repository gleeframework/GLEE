Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you could offer it for $1,200,000 (its value to John), there's room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Win-Win Scenario:**  If Bob accepts, you make a profit above his perceived value. If he rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
