,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $16,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $16,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to go up to $14,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15,000",14000.0,Bob,6,
