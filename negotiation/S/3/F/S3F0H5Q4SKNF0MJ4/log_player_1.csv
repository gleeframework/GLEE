Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and still potentially securing a sale with Bob.  Here's why:

* **Reasoning:**  
    * You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so you can aim for a price closer to that. 
    *  Offering $950,000 is a significant discount for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.
    *  It's still a substantial profit for you,  earning you $150,000 more than selling to John. 
    * **Risk:**  There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer, but you've mitigated the risk by offering a price closer to his perceived value.

**Important Note:**  This is a strategy based on the information given. Real-world negotiations are more complex, and you may want to consider additional factors like:

* **Bob's negotiation style:** Is he aggressive or more cooperative?
* **Your urgency to sell:** How quickly do you need to sell the product? 
* **Other potential buyers:** Are there other buyers besides John who might be interested?"
