"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that works for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?  That's my final offer. I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
