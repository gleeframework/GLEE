{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* $12,000 is still above your desired price point of $15,000.
* There are still 9 rounds left, giving you plenty of time to negotiate with Alice. 
* You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value of $8,000.
* This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get a good deal.
* It leaves room for further negotiation and potentially a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  While $10,500 is closer to my desired price point, it's still above my budget of $15,000.
* There are still 7 rounds left, which gives me some leverage to continue negotiating.
* There's a possibility that Alice may be willing to lower her price further if I continue to reject her offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still seeking a lower price. 
* $9,500 is a good middle ground between my previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $10,500.
* This counteroffer allows for potential agreement while keeping me within my desired price range."
