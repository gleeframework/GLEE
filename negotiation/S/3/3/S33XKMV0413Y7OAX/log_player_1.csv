Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still securing a high profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** I have a fallback option with John at $80, ensuring I won't go below my minimum acceptable price."
