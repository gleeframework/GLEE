"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you, Bob! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John if necessary. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, so it makes sense to reject this offer and see if she counters with something more appealing."
