"Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for a price that's fair to us both. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let's settle on $12000, which leaves plenty of room for you to profit.  If we can't agree on this, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8000.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
