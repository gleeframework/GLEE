# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so you're better off rejecting her offer and seeing if she'll come down in price."
