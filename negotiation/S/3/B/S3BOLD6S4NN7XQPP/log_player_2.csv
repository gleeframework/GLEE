"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation. It's beneficial to reject the initial offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. While I could potentially negotiate further, it's a risk, and I'm not sure if I can get a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer ensures I acquire the product while staying within my budget."
