"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to make a decent profit while you still get a good value for the product. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
