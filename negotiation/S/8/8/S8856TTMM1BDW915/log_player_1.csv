"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate down from this initial price. I'll be prepared to counter if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low for me.  While I want to close the deal, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit that's more than what I'd get from John. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still squeeze a little more out of the deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm making a small concession to Bob, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping that this is close enough for him to accept, but I'm still prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and being forced to sell to John for $8,000 is increasing. I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale and ensure a decent profit."
