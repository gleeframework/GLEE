"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price for the product. I'm also hoping to get Bob to reveal some information about his perceived value of the product through his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get more. I'll reject his offer and counter with my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $12,500 is still a good deal and I'm worried that continuing to negotiate might lead to him walking away or me being forced to sell to John at a lower price."
