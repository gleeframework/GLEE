"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $100, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",88.5,Bob,4,
