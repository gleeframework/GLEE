"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I think that's a fair compromise.,112.0,Bob,4,
