I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'd rather try to get more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good profit for me. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

Bob is clearly not willing to pay more than $10,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
