"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a no-brainer. Alice's offer is above your maximum price, and you have a guaranteed option with John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room for negotiation. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation, even when offering a much lower price.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  By offering $8,000, there's a chance Alice might counter with a price closer to your $10,000 maximum, especially if she's eager to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but it's still above your maximum and your guaranteed alternative with John. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but are serious about staying within your budget. 
* **Justification:** Offering a specific number with a statement about fairness can sometimes help move negotiations along.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point puts you in a good position. It's a significant jump from your initial offer, signaling to Alice that you're getting closer to your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can do $10,500 for the product. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and her final offer is still above your maximum budget and what John is offering. It's time to cut your losses and go with your guaranteed option."
