"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price reflects my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price would be fair to both of us and allow us to move forward with the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $1,280,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
