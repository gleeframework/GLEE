"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price reflects my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to negotiate.  He's still saving money by rejecting Alice's offer and keeping the door open to a lower price. While $1,300,000 is closer to his goal,  there's still room to work towards a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price would be fair to both of us and allow us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $1,280,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,280,000 is very close to Bob's ideal price, he should still try to negotiate further. There's still room to get a slightly lower price without risking losing the deal.  He can potentially get a price closer to $1,250,000 with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price. I'm willing to go up to $1,270,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1270000}
