"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can potentially get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $11500 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his target price, he can likely get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $11800 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further.  However, $11,800 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford at this time.  I'm willing to offer $11,200, which is closer to my budget and still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 11200}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $11200 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $11600 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value of the product. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway to try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been diligently negotiating with Alice, but it seems like they are getting stuck at a price point that's still above his desired target. With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and losing out on a good deal is high.  

Considering his maximum budget is $10,000, and John is offering the product for that price, it makes sense for Bob to buy from John at this point. This guarantees him the product within his budget and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Alice potentially leading to a stalemate."
