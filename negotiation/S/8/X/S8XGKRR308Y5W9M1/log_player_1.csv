{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is within Bob's value range, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, potentially encouraging Bob to accept. However, it's important to be ready to counter if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise and is still well above my minimum price of $10,000. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
