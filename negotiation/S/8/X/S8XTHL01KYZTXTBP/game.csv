"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my top price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is my best and final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
