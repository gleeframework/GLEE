"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm setting the initial offer at $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high but not outrageous offer gives me room to negotiate. This strategy:

* **Anchors:** Sets a high reference point, making Bob's counteroffers potentially closer to my desired range.
* **Signals Value:** A high price implies the product is highly valuable and sought-after. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  Shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also signals I believe in the product's worth. 

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, always keeping John's $1,000,000 offer as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a significant jump down, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John at this stage would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,500,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,650,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to control the pace of the negotiation. By countering with a price exactly halfway between our last offers:

* **Shows Flexibility:**  Demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate reasonably.
* **Maintains Value Perception:**  Avoids drastically dropping the price, reinforcing the product's worth.
* **Pushes for a Higher Price:**  Aims to bring Bob closer to my desired range.

I'm prepared to make further adjustments based on Bob's response, but I'm also mindful of not letting the negotiations drag on for too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $1,500,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about $1,550,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating incrementally now, but I still believe there's room for him to go higher. While $1,550,000 is a tempting offer, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a better deal.  I'll aim for a smaller concession in my next counteroffer to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,625,000. This reflects my commitment to closing this deal while acknowledging the value you're receiving."",
""product_price"": 1625000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** By only reducing the price by $25,000, I signal that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Emphasize Value:** I want to keep reminding Bob of the benefits he'll gain, justifying the higher price.
* **Time Consideration:**  While I'm willing to negotiate further, I'm aware that each round brings me closer to potentially accepting John's offer. I want to guide Bob towards a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,625,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,625,000, which would be $1,562,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,562,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,562,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,600,000, Bob's offer of $1,562,500 is a reasonable compromise.  Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Significant Profit:** I'm still making a considerable profit above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and each round delays me receiving payment.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has consistently shown interest and is moving closer to my range with each offer. 

Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of missing out on a deal altogether."
