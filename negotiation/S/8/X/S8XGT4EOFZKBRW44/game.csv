"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,500,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $1,500,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,625,000. This reflects my commitment to closing this deal while acknowledging the value you're receiving.",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,625,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,625,000, which would be $1,562,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1562500.0,Bob,6,
