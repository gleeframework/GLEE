"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a strong offer of $1,400,000, we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial price allows for some negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and fairness of the offer, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is good, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product. I have room to negotiate and aim for a better price in the next round. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a last resort option, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By coming down to $1,350,000, we're signaling a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his offer.
* **Justification:**  We're reminding Bob of the product's value while acknowledging his constraints, aiming to maintain a sense of fairness.
* **Clear Goal:**  We're aiming to settle near the midpoint between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've given this some more thought, and I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,325,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but his increments are getting smaller. We're still significantly above our minimum price and have room to push for a little more. It's worth risking another round to see if we can get closer to $1,340,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to land at a final price.  Would you be willing to do $1,340,000?  That's a significant investment for you, but I truly believe the value you'll gain from this product will be well worth it."",
""product_price"": 1340000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:** We're making it clear this is a final price point to encourage Bob to seriously consider it.
* **Slight Concession:** By moving to $1,340,000, we show flexibility but maintain a firm stance above $1,325,000.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the product's worth to justify the price and nudge Bob towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,335,000. I hope this helps us reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,335,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,335,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to our desired price point. While we could try to push for the extra $5,000, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting $1,335,000 ensures a very profitable deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.  It's better to secure a strong offer now than risk ending up with John's lower offer later."
