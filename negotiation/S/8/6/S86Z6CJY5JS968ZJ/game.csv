"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm looking to save as much as possible, and I'm not sure if the product is worth that much to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is still a fantastic price for the product considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
