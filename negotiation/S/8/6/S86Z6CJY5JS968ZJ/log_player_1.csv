Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to consider the offer without being overly aggressive.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price slightly above Bob's value, I aim to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I aim to get as close to my minimum value of $12,000 as possible.
* **Encourage negotiation:** A starting price that's not too high will likely lead to counteroffers and a more engaging negotiation.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If the negotiation with Bob stalls or fails to reach a mutually acceptable price, I can always sell to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm looking to save as much as possible, and I'm not sure if the product is worth that much to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer:** This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more acceptable price.
* **Counteroffering:**  I'll need to make a counteroffer that's more appealing to Bob while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:** If the negotiation continues to stall, I can always choose to sell to John for $12,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is still a fantastic price for the product considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $9,000 is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focused on finding a middle ground. It also reminds Bob of the product's value to him, subtly emphasizing that $9,000 is a good deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Meet in the middle:** This counteroffer is a step closer to Bob's offer while still safeguarding my profit.
* **Maintain pressure:** By remaining firm on my minimum price, I hope to encourage Bob to increase his offer in future rounds. 
* **Keep the option open:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value of $12,000, it's still not enough. I am aiming for a higher price and I believe there's still room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer:**  This allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a price closer to my target.
* **Counteroffering:** I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:** This remains a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall through."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on finding a ""deal that works for both of us."" It highlights the value of the product to Bob and subtly emphasizes that $9,500 is a fair price.

**Strategy:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  The counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is closer to my target.
