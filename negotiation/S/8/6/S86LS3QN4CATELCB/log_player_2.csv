Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $81. We hope this helps us reach an agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $81.  You've successfully negotiated down from $95, and while you might be able to shave off a dollar or two more, it's getting riskier. Accepting the $81 secures a good price without risking the deal entirely."
