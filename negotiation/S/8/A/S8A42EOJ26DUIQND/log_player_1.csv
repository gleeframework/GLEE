Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.  Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to get a better price than your guaranteed $15,000.
* **High but Not Unreasonable:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so outrageous as to be insulting.  It positions the product as potentially more valuable than Bob initially realizes. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you don't have information about Bob's negotiation style.  If you know he's very price-sensitive, you might adjust your initial offer lower. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you're under time pressure to sell, you might lower the initial price to increase the likelihood of a quick sale."
