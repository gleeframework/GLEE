"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125.  Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my final offer.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $115 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's the absolute lowest I can go, and it's still above my minimum.  What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
