"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's minimum price as possible while still getting a good deal.  $10,500 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $15,000. It's also likely that if Bob rejects again, Alice will stick to her price of $13,000 or make a counteroffer closer to it.  Therefore, accepting the offer at $13,000 ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without the risk of further negotiation."
