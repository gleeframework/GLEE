"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal for Bob:** $12,500 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $15,000 and is a significant saving compared to buying from John. 
* **It's a fair price for Alice:**  Alice is getting closer to her desired selling price of $12,000.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of a stalemate or running out of rounds before a deal is reached. 

Accepting the offer allows both parties to close the deal at a mutually beneficial price, ensuring a quick and efficient transaction."
