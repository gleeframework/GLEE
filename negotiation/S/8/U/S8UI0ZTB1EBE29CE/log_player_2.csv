Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to accept.  Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $775,000 is still too far below what I need to accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about $850,000?

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000, and you have a guaranteed option at $800,000.  Save the time and potential hassle of further negotiation."
