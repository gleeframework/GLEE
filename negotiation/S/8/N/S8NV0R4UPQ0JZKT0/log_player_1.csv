While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer beyond this point. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
