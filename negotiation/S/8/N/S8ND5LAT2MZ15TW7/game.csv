"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $11250.
