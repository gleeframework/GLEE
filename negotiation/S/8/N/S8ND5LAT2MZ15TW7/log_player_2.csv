"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  He has a clear limit of $15,000, and should use that knowledge to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $11,500 is closer to his budget, he can likely get it for a bit less.  He should counter-offer again, but be mindful of potentially going too low and risking losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $11,000?  That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase if you agree."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $11250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been stubborn, but her final offer is within Bob's budget and gets him a good price.  He's already saved $3,750 from John's price and there's a good chance Alice won't budge further. It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
