"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $15,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $13,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with an offer of $12,800. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",12800.0,Alice,5,
