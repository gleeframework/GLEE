Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm increasing Bob's offer by $1500, which is halfway between our current positions. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise but still hold firm to my value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher.  I'm confident I can get my desired price from John, so I'll take the sure thing and sell to him."
