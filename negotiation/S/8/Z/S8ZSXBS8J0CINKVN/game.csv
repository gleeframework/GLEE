,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $130 is a bit too high for me. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $95? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about $105? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still above my budget.  Would you consider $98? That's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.",98.0,Bob,6,
