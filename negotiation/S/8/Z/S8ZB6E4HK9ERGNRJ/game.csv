"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $20000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $7500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9000?  This would give me some room to work with and hopefully allow us to close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $9000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to meet a minimum of $11000 to make it worth my while. Can you consider meeting me in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm definitely getting closer to making a decision.  $10500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  However, I'm willing to go to $10250.  This is very close to what I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.  What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'll meet you at $10750, but that's as low as I can go. This is already below my minimum, so I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10750.0,Alice,7,
