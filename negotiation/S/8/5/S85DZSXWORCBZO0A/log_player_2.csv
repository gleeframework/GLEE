Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $130. This is my final offer, so think carefully before making a decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $130 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I'll reject and try to get closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $120?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'll meet you at $125, and that's my final compromise. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $125 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. At this point, I'm close to my limit and I'm not sure if we'll be able to come to an agreement with Alice.  It's better to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $100."
