"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and open tone sets the stage for a productive negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial to Bob, appealing to his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is Higher:** My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, and selling to John for that price is always an option.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for me to push for a better deal. 
* **Evaluating Risk:** Selling to Bob at $9,000 is tempting, but I'm willing to risk losing him to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a little lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is a ""good deal"" for both of us, creating a sense of fairness.
* **Strategic Price:** $9,500 is a reasonable compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Aiming Higher:**  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,000, and selling to John remains a viable option.
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can push him higher.
* **Remaining Flexible:**  I'm not completely inflexible, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that's too far from my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about $9,300? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by increasing my offer slightly from $9,200.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm again highlighting the ""fairness"" of my offer to create a sense of compromise.
* **Close to the Middle:** $9,300 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it more likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $9,100 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but not yet at a point where I'm comfortable accepting.
* **Risk Assessment:**  There's a real risk that Bob will continue to lowball me, and I might not be able to close a deal with him within the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $12,000.  It's a more secure and profitable option at this point."
