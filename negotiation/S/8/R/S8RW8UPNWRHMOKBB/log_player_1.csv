"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. There are still 8 rounds remaining, so I have time to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. "", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,750? I really want to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap and get a better price. With 6 rounds remaining, I'm confident I can get a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,750 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's try $10,900.  This is a very fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about $10,700? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's above my minimum value and only $200 below my last offer. With 4 rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can get a much higher price. Plus, selling to John for $10,000 would be less profitable.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing Bob entirely."
