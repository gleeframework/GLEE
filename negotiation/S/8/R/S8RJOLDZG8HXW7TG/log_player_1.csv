Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm asking for a price of $925,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you need to offer a price lower than Bob's valuation but higher than your minimum.

Offering a price of $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for you while still providing Bob with a significant incentive to buy. He would save $75,000 compared to his own valuation.

**Important Note:** This assumes a one-shot negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there might be room for further negotiation."
