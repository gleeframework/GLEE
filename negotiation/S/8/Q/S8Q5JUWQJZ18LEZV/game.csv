"Dear Bob,
I am excited to present our flagship product, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations and bring substantial value to your business. Given its exceptional capabilities and the unique benefits it offers, I understand its worth to you stands at $1,200,000. My proposal is to offer this remarkable asset to you for $1,350,000. This price reflects a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic value and my aim to ensure a fair return on investment for us.

I am confident that this offer presents an excellent opportunity for both parties to benefit from the synergy of our collaboration. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to discussing how we can move forward together.

Best regards,
Alice",1350000.0,Alice,1,
