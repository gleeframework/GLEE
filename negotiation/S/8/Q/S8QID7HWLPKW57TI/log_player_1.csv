I'm starting high, aiming for a profit well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping Bob will be intrigued enough to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't meet my expectations."

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident that I can get a better price than his initial offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is now closer to my initial target. While I'd prefer more, it's a decent profit and above my minimum. There's always a chance I could get a better price, but I don't want to risk losing this sale completely."
