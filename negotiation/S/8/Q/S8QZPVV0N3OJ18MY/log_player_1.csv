Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price ($80), but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges the value to Bob and creates a friendly tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  While $85 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll try to push for a price closer to my initial offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This still gives you a good deal and is closer to what I'm hoping to get for it."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $92.50 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you do $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $88 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $80 and I'm confident that I won't find a better buyer.  It's not worth risking a sale to keep pushing for a higher price."
