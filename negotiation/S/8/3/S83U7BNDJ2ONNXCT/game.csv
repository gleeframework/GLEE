,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $95 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference again and go with $98.50. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",98.5,Alice,5,
