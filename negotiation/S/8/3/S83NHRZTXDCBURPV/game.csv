"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. Let's see if we can close the gap.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
