"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm going to counter with $112. It's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $108 is still above my minimum and better than selling to John. I'm going to accept his offer to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
