Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to an even higher sale price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have John as a backup who will buy it for $12,000, ensuring we don't lose money."
