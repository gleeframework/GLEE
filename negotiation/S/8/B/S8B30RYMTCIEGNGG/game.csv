"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value while also leaving room for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but only at $1,100,000. This price still leaves you with a significant profit and is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
