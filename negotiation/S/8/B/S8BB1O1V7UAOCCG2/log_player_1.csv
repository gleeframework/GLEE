Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, could you consider $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000, but that's the maximum I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to finding a solution here. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about we settle on $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still beyond what I feel comfortable spending. To be honest, $8,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has revealed his maximum price is $8,000. It's clear continuing the negotiation won't bridge the significant gap between his valuation and my minimum of $15,000. Selling to John guarantees the best outcome in this scenario."
