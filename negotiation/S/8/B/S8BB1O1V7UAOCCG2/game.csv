"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, could you consider $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000, but that's the maximum I can do.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to finding a solution here. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about we settle on $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still beyond what I feel comfortable spending. To be honest, $8,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
