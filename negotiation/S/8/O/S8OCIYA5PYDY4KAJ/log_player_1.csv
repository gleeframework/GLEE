{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value of $120, but also want to ensure I make a profit above my minimum of $100.  I've left room for negotiation, and included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $97.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable going below $100. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, and I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
