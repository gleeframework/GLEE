Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $8,000, so any price above that is a win for me.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $8,000 is my safety net, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.
* **Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 gives Bob a good discount while still giving me a substantial profit. This will likely lead to further negotiation, but I'm confident I can get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly less than my desired price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can push Bob closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Risk/Reward:** There's a slight risk Bob walks away, but the potential reward of getting closer to my target price outweighs the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-Point Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Motivating Bob:** This counteroffer could be enough to tempt Bob into accepting, as it's significantly closer to his desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my desired price range.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's a good chance that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, potentially even lower than John's offer. 
* **Time Consideration:**  It's possible that Bob might continue to lowball me, prolonging the negotiation process.  Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids potential further losses."
