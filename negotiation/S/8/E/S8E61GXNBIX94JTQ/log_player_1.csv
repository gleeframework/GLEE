"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm confident in the value of the product.  I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm offering $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to my desired price point and my minimum.  I'm aiming for a compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate. I'm going to see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm offering $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction from my last offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer. I want to demonstrate that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum, but I'm still not confident we can reach an agreement.  The risk of further negotiation leading to a price below my minimum is too high.  I'm going to sell to John and guarantee my desired profit."
