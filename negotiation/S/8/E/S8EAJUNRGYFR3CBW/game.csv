"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of its value. While I would like to accommodate your budget, I must respectfully decline your offer of $80. Considering the quality and unique features of the product, I believe it is worth $100.

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $100.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm inclined to agree to a price closer to what you're suggesting. However, to ensure fairness and reflect the value of our product, I propose a final offer of $95. This price strikes a balance between our interests and I believe it offers a good deal for both parties involved.",95.0,Alice,5,
