"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,750,000:** This initial offer is a significant amount above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Message:** The message is polite and professional, highlighting the value of the product without being aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to John would be a much better outcome at this point. However, I want to see if I can leverage Bob's interest to get closer to my desired price.

* **Proceeding to the next round:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum but still allowing for some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to show my commitment to finding a deal. This price still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $1,600,000:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes my willingness to find a solution while reiterating the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome.  Selling to John would be a better choice right now.  However, I'm still hopeful of closing the deal with Bob at a better price.

* **Proceeding to the next round:** I'll counteroffer again with a price that is closer to my desired outcome, but still shows flexibility in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,550,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $1,550,000:**  This counteroffer is a significant concession from my previous offer, bringing the price much closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the compromise I've made, highlighting the fair deal it represents for both parties, and conveys a sense of urgency to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:**  Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired outcome. With only 4 rounds remaining, the likelihood of getting a higher offer from Bob is slim.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees a better outcome and avoids the risk of a further drop in price."
