Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly greeting and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.  It sets the price slightly lower than the potential value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation without jeopardizing my own minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. Would you be willing to go down to $87? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer $90, Bob's offer of $87 is only $2 below my minimum. It's a better deal than selling to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
