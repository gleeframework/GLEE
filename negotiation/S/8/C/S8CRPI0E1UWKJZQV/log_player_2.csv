"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it holds. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  You are willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is likely willing to sell for less than $10,000 since her value is $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This offer still allows me to get a fair return on the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You should buy from John.  You are willing to pay $8,000 and Alice is now offering $9,250.  Even if you were to reject and counteroffer, you are unlikely to get Alice to budge much lower than her current price."
