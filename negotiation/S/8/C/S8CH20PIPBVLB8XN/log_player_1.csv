"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you might be interested. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'd accept. There's no room for negotiation to earn more. I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer."
