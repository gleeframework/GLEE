"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $90, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the idea of meeting in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise considering the product's value.",85.0,Alice,5,
