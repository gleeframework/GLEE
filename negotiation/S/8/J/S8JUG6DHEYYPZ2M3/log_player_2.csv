Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer is closer to the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is within your budget of $1,200,000 and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  Accepting her offer secures the product at a good price."
