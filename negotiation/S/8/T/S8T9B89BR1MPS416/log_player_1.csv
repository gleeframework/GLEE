"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good return on my investment.
