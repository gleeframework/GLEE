"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,650,000.  This reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer that bridges the gap.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to move up, the  $1,150,000 offer is still under its value to me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, that price is still a bit too high for my budget. I can go up to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
