"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That seems like a fair deal to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
