Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fantastic deal considering what you could gain. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John provides a safety net at $1,200,000, the goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a ""good deal,"" making it more appealing to Bob."
