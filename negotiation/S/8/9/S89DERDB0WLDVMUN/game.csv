"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $130. Is that something you'd be interested in?",130.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95. If we can meet in the middle, I think we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which is $102.50. Is that something you'd be interested in?",102.5,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $98.75?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",98.75,Bob,6,,
