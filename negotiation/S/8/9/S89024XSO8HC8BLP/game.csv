"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $9,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
