"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. How about we start the negotiation at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200, which is a bit more than your last offer, but still a discount from the original price. Let's see if we can shake on it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
