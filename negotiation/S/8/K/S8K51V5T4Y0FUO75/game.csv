"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to think outside the box. How about we meet in the middle at $79? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a bit closer to your original offer.",79.0,Alice,5,
