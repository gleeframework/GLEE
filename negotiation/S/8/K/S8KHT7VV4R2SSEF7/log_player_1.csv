Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing Alice gets $1,000,000.  Therefore, the focus is squeezing out extra profit from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""exceed your expectations"" aim to increase the product's perceived value in Bob's eyes. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. If multiple rounds were allowed, the strategy might involve a lower initial offer to gauge Bob's reactions and adjust accordingly."
