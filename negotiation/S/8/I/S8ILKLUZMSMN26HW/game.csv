"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer and let me know if it's something we can work with?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit away from your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
