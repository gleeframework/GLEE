"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $12,000. Since you value the product at $15,000 and Alice values it at $8,000, there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to get a better price. How about $10,000? I think that's fair considering we both can benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for you. You can get the product for significantly less than John's price of $15,000, and still save a good amount of money compared to your initial valuation of $15,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings may not be worth the risk of losing the deal or prolonging the negotiation."
