"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Even though Alice claims it's worth $1,000,000 to Bob, this is irrelevant to Bob's decision. He's only interested in the actual price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a price that fits his budget."
