"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a very competitive price of $1,400,000.  It's a significant value proposition for you, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to get a fair return for my product, and it's closer to your stated value. Let's see if we can reach a deal this round.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm seeing some progress here.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,175,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $1,175,000 is still a bit low.  Let's try $1,225,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a sign of good faith.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
