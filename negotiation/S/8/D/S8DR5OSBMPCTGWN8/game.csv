"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value the product has for you. I'm counteroffering at $915000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",915000.0,Alice,7,

I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product will bring to me, and it's still a good deal for you. However, if we can't meet at this price, I may have to consider buying the product from another seller who is willing to sell it to me for $1000000.",875000.0,Bob,8,
