"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $120 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there is no reason to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
