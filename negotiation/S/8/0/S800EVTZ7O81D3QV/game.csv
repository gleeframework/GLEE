"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $90. Let's try to close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 was a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between $95 and $90. How about we settle on $92.50? It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",92.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really pushing my budget here, but I can offer you $91.  Let's make this happen!",91.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $92.50 was a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $91.75? It's a small compromise, but I'm willing to make it work to get the deal done.",91.75,Alice,7,
