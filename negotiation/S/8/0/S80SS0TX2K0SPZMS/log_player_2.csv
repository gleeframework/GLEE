"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm selling it for $140. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure you'll get great value out of it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product value of $120. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $150."
