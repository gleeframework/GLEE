"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $1,000,000. 
* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.
* It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering Alice $850,000, which is $100,000 less than her offer. 
* This is a significant reduction, but still a decent amount above what Alice is willing to accept. 
* This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate but also signals my serious intent to buy the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer is $975,000, which is still higher than my initial counteroffer of $850,000.
* It's likely that we can find a middle ground, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price. 
* While buying from John for $1,000,000 is an option, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $975,000 is closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000, so I'm increasing my offer to $900,000.
* This is a fair compromise, as it's halfway between her offer and my previous offer.
* It shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $987,500 is very close to my maximum price of $1,000,000. 
* Further negotiation may be possible, but the potential savings are minimal. 
* It's not worth risking further time and effort, especially since John is offering a guaranteed price. 
* Buying from John ensures I get the product at a known price and avoids any further negotiation."
