"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,600,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,800,000 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $1,700,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,650,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,675,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
