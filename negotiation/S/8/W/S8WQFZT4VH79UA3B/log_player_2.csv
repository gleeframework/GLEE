"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to buying from John, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds to work with and is willing to pay less than $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $11,000?  It's a fair price that gives you a good discount and allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, he's still within his budget and has more rounds to negotiate. He should try to get closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
