"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $9,500.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than her perceived value of the product, it's still lower than your maximum price of $10,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
