"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really value. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice is cheaper:**  Alice's offer of $120 is less than the $150 you'd pay John.
* **Your goal is to save money:**  While you could reject Alice's offer, that would mean paying more to John."
