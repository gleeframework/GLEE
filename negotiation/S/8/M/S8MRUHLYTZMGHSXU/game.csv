"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Alice,3,
