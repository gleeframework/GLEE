Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This offer won't last long, so let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to start negotiations higher with Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a price of $20,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down, knowing your bottom line is covered.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning the offer won't last, you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing him from potentially finding alternatives. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price.  You can gradually lower the price, but never go below $15,000 to ensure you don't lose money on the sale."
