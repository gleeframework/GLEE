"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $8,000 to us, but we're open to discussing a price. Let's aim for a fair deal. How about we start at $7,000?",7000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $5,500. Can we meet in the middle?",5500.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can we discuss a price of $5,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",5200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"We understand your concerns, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. Our counteroffer is $5,600. This price allows us to cover our costs and still be competitive in the market. Please let us know if this works for you.",5600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $5,600 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $5,300, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",5300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $5,200, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll consider it a good deal.",5200.0,Bob,8,
