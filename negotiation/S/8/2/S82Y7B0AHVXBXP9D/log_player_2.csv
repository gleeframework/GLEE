Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  To be frank, $1,050,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to take another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal. I'm also aware that I can still buy from John for $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $1,075,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value it offers and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent about my position. I have another buyer interested who's offering closer to my asking price. However, I value our conversation and believe this product can be a great asset to you.  I'm willing to make a significant move and accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I need a decision soon.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is putting pressure on me with the ""final offer"" and the ""other buyer"" information. However, I'm still holding out hope to get a better deal. I'm also aware that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, so I have a safety net.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can close the gap."
