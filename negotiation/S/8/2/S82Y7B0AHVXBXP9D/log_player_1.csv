"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this product with you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High but Reasonable Starting Point:** We're starting significantly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This anchors the negotiation high. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes this is a starting point and encourages Bob to share his thoughts, signaling willingness to negotiate.
* **No Rush to John:** While John offers a guaranteed sale, there's potential for a higher profit with Bob. We'll observe Bob's response in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly below my minimum. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, accepting at this stage would leave a lot of money on the table.  I'm confident I can get him higher, especially with John as a backup option. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  To be frank, $1,050,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm (Mostly):**  We're making a relatively small concession ($30,000) to signal that we're serious about the value.
* **Justifying the Price:** We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, framing it in terms of potential returns to make the price more palatable.
* **Seeking Compromise:** We're using language like ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to move closer to our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $1,075,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value it offers and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but slowly. Bob is only incrementing his offer by $25,000 each round. At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a satisfactory price before we run out of rounds. Rejecting keeps the pressure on Bob while we consider alternative strategies."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent about my position. I have another buyer interested who's offering closer to my asking price. However, I value our conversation and believe this product can be a great asset to you.  I'm willing to make a significant move and accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I need a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** We're subtly letting Bob know about John's offer without revealing the exact amount. This creates a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Significant Concession:**  We're dropping $20,000, a larger amount than before, showing flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* **Final Offer:**  By framing this as our final offer, we're putting the ball firmly in Bob's court and increasing the pressure to make a decision. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're emphasizing the need for a quick decision to reinforce the urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $1,087,500.  This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob is sticking to his incremental increases, and we're still $112,500 away from my minimum.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob mirroring the ""final offer"" language suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price or no deal at all, while John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000.

At this point, the certainty of John's offer and the potential for Bob to continue lowballing outweigh the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob. It's time to walk away from the negotiation and secure the guaranteed profit."
