"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $825000 for the product.  This gives you a good deal while also ensuring I get a fair price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $775000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $800000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
