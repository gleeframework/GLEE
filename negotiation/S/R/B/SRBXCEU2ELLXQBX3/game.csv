"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to go that high?",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about we settle at $105? That's a fair compromise, I think.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,115.0
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",115.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line. It seems we're getting close though. Would you consider $108?  That's the best I can do.",108.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm not going to go any lower than $120, Bob. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Alice,7,,
