"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement today. Considering the value this product holds for you, I propose a price of $9,500. Let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I am prepared to consider a price of $9,000 for the product. This offers a compromise between our positions and I believe it will be mutually beneficial. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer, Bob has several rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to bring the price down further and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still slightly above what I can afford right now.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still $800 higher.  Bob has a few rounds left and can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While $8,800 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a final price that's within my range.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence and understanding throughout this negotiation process. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. Based on our discussions, I am willing to offer the product at $8,600. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I hope this revised offer will help us reach a satisfactory conclusion.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,600 is still $600 above Bob's maximum budget. With only three rounds remaining, the chances of getting Alice down to $8,000 are slim.  It's more efficient for Bob to purchase the product from John at $8,000, ensuring he gets the best price and avoids further negotiation."
