Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $120 allows for some negotiation room while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  While the price is above Bob's valuation, it might pique his interest and potentially lead to a counteroffer that's still profitable for Alice. 
* **Guaranteed Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $150 with John if Bob declines, so there's no risk of losing out completely.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
