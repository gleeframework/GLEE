"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $12,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
