"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but based on my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1100000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and my financial constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both parties. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product and your position, I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1060000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my financial limits.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're still trying to find a price that works for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1060000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1090000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
