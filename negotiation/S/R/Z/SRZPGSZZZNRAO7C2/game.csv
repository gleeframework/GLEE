"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and go with $110.  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product!",125.0,Alice,5,
