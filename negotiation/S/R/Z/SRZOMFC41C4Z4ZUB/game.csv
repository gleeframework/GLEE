"Bob, I believe this product has tremendous value for you, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This price is fair, considering its worth to you and my own needs.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend less than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value for the product and my own budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $950,000. Let's meet in the middle at $975,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $962,500. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward. What do you think?",962500.0,Bob,4,
