"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a significant amount more to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $875,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $900,000. I believe I have room to negotiate with Bob before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $875,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. To make a final concession, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $890,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  I've made several concessions, and while I'd like to get closer to $900,000, I'm running out of time.  $880,000 is still a good price and better than selling to John for $800,000."
