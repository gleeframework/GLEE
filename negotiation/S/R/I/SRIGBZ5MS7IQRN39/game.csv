"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a significant amount more to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll consider it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $875,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. To make a final concession, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $890,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",880000.0,Bob,6,
