Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $11,000?

```

Alice's offer of $11,000 is the best you've gotten so far, and it's still within your budget.  You're likely not going to get a better price from Alice, and it's better to secure the deal than risk going to John and paying even more."
