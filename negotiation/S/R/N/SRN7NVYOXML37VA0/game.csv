"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $140 for it.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $150, which is a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $150. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get at least $155 out of this deal. How about we meet in the middle of $155 and $150? I'll sell it to you for $152.50",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to pulling the trigger on this deal, but $152.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $151? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us both walk away happy.",151.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to pulling the trigger, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting the best price for my product. I'm willing to meet you at $152, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's fair for both of us. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,7,
