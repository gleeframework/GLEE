Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity with significant value. I'm confident it will be a great asset for your company. My asking price is $1,150,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, my budget is a bit tight, and I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in making a deal, $1,050,000 is too low for me. I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and it gives us both room to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $950,000 is simply too low. I've already come down significantly from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  At this point, it's more profitable for me to sell to John for $1,000,000."
