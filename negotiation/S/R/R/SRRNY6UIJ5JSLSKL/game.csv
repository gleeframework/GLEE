"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, my budget is a bit tight, and I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and it gives us both room to move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
