"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,150,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
