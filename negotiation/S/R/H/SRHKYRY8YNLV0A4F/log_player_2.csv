"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the $1,000,000 offer is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,750,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider $1,400,000, but that's my absolute final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" is still more expensive than John's offer. There's no point in further negotiation at this point."
