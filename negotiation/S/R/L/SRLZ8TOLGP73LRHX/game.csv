"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $750000 doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $825000.  This gives you a good deal and allows me to reach a fair price. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $775000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. How about $800000? This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Alice,5,
