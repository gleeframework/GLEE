"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, based on my current budget and needs, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $1800000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.
