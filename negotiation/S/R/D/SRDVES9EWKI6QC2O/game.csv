"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be comfortable paying $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, and $90 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to see $110 to make this work.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $100?  That's the absolute most I can offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
