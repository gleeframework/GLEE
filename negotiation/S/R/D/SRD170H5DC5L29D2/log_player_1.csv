"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $875,000, which I believe is a fair starting point given our respective valuations. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $875,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob as it's still early in the negotiation. Bob's counter-offer indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $920,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering its potential."", 
""product_price"": 920000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly very interested and is moving closer to my desired price point. Accepting $900,000 now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
