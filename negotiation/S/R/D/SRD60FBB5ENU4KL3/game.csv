"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for it. This reflects the value I'm seeing in it, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? This gives us both a good price and allows us to close the deal quickly. ",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
