,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I want to make this work. How about $680,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal.",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $680,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $700,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",700000.0,Alice,5,
