"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a little out of my budget, but I'm willing to move to $725,000.  That's a significant step from my initial offer, and I think it reflects my strong interest in the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, $725,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is a lot closer to what I had in mind, but I'm afraid I'm still a little off. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000. Would you be willing to meet that price? I'm ready to close the deal today if you are.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about the other offer. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,7,
