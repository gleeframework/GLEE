Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your budget, but it's still not the best deal for you. You are looking to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you can try to get closer to your target price of $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $11200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is closer to your target price, but it's still more than you're willing to pay.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. It's better to stick with the safe option and avoid risking further negotiation with Alice, as you may not be able to secure a lower price."
