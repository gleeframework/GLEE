"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is my maximum, but I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the potential value this product offers.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm happy to meet you at $950,000.  This represents a significant drop from your initial offer and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is a significant drop from your last offer, and I'm hoping it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
