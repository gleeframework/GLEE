Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,500,000. This is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I've framed the message to highlight the product's potential value to Bob and create a sense of urgency without being overly pushy. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** By setting a higher price, I aim to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The price allows for negotiation if Bob is interested but feels the price is too high. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000."
