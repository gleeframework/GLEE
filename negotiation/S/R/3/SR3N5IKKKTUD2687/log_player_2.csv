Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  You're getting the product well below your $1,500,000 maximum, and you've negotiated Alice down significantly from her initial offer.
* **Alice is firming up:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.  She's stated this is her ""final offer.""
* **Time is a factor:**  While you have some rounds left, dragging it out further increases the risk of Alice sticking to her price or the negotiation failing altogether. 

Accepting at $785,000 secures you a good deal."
