"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget though. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it.  What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $10,000? I'm confident it's a fair price.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
