"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm committed to reaching a deal with you, but I need to be fair to myself.  I'm making a final offer of $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession on my part.  I'm confident you'll recognize the value this product will bring you.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to be fair to yourself, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
