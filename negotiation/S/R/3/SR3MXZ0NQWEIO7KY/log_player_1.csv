Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too low for me. I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While I'm open to compromise, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm going to make a final counteroffer in the next round.  If Bob doesn't meet me closer to my desired price, I'll move on and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm committed to reaching a deal with you, but I need to be fair to myself.  I'm making a final offer of $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession on my part.  I'm confident you'll recognize the value this product will bring you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to be fair to yourself, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's a secure deal, and it's better than continuing to haggle with Bob and risking not getting any sale at all."
