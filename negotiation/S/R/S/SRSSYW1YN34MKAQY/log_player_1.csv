"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000.  This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower offer, but still aim for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable, I'm not going to settle for that right away.  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is still significantly higher than my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my initial price. Hopefully, he sees this as a fair compromise and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than my minimum, and I'm confident we can't get much better in the remaining rounds.  Accepting his offer is the best option for maximizing my profit."
