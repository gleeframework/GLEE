"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, and I'm offering it to you for $1400000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find some middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1250000? I'm willing to compromise and make a deal if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1275000? This allows me to make a decent profit while still being fair to you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1230000? I'm willing to make a deal if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to drop my price a bit more to $1250000. This is a significant compromise on my part. Let's wrap this up and finalize a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1245000. Can you meet me at this price?",1245000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one final compromise and meet you at $1240000. This is my absolute bottom line. If we can't reach an agreement, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers.",1240000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1235000. If this doesn't work out, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",1235000.0,Bob,10,
