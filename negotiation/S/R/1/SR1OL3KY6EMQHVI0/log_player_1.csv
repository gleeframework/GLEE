Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,250 is closer to my minimum price, but I still think I can do better.  I'm going to see if I can get him to come up just a bit more before I consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $9,375.  This is a fair price for both of us and avoids us going back and forth further."", ""product_price"": 9375}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. I'm willing to walk away if it's not a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, and I'm running out of rounds. I'd really like to get closer to my minimum price, but  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and ending up with nothing. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a good profit and avoids further negotiation."
