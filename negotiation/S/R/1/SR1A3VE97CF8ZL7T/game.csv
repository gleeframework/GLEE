"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and leaves me with a healthy profit. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a bit more in line with my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move forward with the sale.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to move forward with the sale.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate that. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about $1,300,000? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
