Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher offer ($1,500,000) aims to capitalize on potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate. Even if Bob counter-offers, Alice has a good chance of securing a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential gain, making the high price seem more justified."
