Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my original target. How about we meet at $1,275,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,275,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away."
