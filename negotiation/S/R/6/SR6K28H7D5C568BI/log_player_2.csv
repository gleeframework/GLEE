"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. This would still be a good profit for you, and it fits my budget better.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than Bob's initial $15,000 limit and gets Bob a good deal. Accepting this offer means saving $4,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of trying to squeeze out a few more dollars."
