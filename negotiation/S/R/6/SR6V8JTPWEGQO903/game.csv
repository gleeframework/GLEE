"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1250000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is the price I was initially offered by John, but I'd like to give you a chance to match that price. I think it's a fair offer, considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking of a price of $1225000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go above $1200000. I've already been offered this price by John, and I'm not comfortable paying more. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $1200000 is the maximum I can afford. I'd like to make a final offer at this price. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
