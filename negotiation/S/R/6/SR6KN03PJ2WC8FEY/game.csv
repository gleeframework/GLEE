"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $18,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but still a good deal for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $17,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $17,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to listen to your offer, but I need to think about it. Let me counter with $19,000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,5,
