"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'd be willing to accept $9,000 for it.  This would still leave some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
