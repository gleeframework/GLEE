Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, considering its value to me. I'm open to negotiating further, but this is my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in the product.  I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product.
