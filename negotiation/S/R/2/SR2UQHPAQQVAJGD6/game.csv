"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, considering its value to me. I'm open to negotiating further, but this is my initial offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $850,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer lined up for a price closer to my initial ask.  If you're serious about purchasing, would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise to get us moving towards a deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in the product.  I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, and I understand you're making a genuine effort. However, the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
