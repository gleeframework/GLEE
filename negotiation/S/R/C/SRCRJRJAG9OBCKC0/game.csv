"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $775,000.  However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $812,500. This represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's reach an agreement and move forward.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting close, Alice, but $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but no further. Can you meet me at this price?",795000.0,Bob,6,
