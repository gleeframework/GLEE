"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment on my part. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm motivated to find a solution. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,075,000?  This reflects a fair compromise considering the immense value this product offers.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product. Let's find a way to make this work.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product. Let's bridge the gap. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  This ensures you're getting an exceptional asset, and it allows me to achieve my minimum threshold. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
