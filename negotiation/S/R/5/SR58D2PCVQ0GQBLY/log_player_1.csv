Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment on my part. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below John's offer. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  We need to push him further towards the million-dollar mark."
