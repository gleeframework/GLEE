# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly profitable asset for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's well over your budget and likely far more than the product is worth to you. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment on my part. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm motivated to find a solution. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,075,000?  This reflects a fair compromise considering the immense value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget. It's crucial to stay firm and continue negotiating to try and get a better price. There are still several rounds left, and there's potential for further compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product. Let's bridge the gap. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  This ensures you're getting an exceptional asset, and it allows me to achieve my minimum threshold.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. While it's a lower price than her initial offers, it's not worth risking further negotiations with only a few rounds left. Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees me the product within my budget and secures the deal quickly."
