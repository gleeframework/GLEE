"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is his maximum budget, there's no reason to pay that immediately.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price of $10,000. This is a strong opening counteroffer that signals Bob's intention to negotiate and hopefully gets Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate further. There are 7 rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit more. Rejecting the offer allows for continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob increases his offer slightly to $10,500. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is still pushing for a lower price.  It's a compromise that might be more appealing to Alice than his previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, Alice has offered $11,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's last offer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise and might even increase her price in subsequent rounds.  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a decent price and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations or needing to buy from John at a higher price."
