"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you and the value I place on it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value I can get from it.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $17,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $13,500. I'm thinking of a price of $14,250 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value I can get from it.",14250.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $17,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer of $14,250. I'm thinking of a price of $15,625 for the product. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15,625 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $14,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $14,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,9,
