```"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $89 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one final concession. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I get a decent price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is just 2 dollars above your last offer. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $92 is still higher than my desired price point and is getting close to the price John is offering. It's better to avoid further negotiation and take the guaranteed price from John. I've already put in a lot of effort negotiating with Alice and may not be able to get a better price."
