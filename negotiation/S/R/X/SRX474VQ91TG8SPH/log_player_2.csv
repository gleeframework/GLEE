"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I'm asking for $900,000. This price reflects its unique qualities and the potential it holds for your business. I believe it's a fair offer, considering the significant benefit you'll receive. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer. This leaves room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget.
* **Significant Difference:** Offering $700,000 creates a $200,000 difference from Alice's asking price. This might encourage her to counter-offer, potentially meeting you somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the backup option of John's $800,000 offer, so you're not desperate to accept a price you're uncomfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Price:** Alice's new offer is closer to your budget but still more expensive than John's guaranteed $800,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a better price and not just settling for any discount. There's room to negotiate further towards your target. 
* **Limited Risk:** While you risk Alice walking away, you have John as a reliable backup at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000.  To make it worth my while to go with your product, I'd need to get it closer to that price point. Would you be willing to consider $825,000?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Honesty and Leverage:**  By mentioning John's offer without revealing the exact source, you create a sense of urgency and give Alice a reason to consider a lower price.
* **Strategic Counter:** You're meeting Alice halfway between her current offer ($850,000) and your target price ($800,000). This demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Potential for Agreement:** This offer might be enticing enough for Alice to accept, as it's significantly higher than your initial offer and still profitable for her."
