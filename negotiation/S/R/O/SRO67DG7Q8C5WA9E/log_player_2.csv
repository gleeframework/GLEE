"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $15000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $14,000.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500.  This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and still leaves him with a profit of $1,500 (since the product is worth $15,000 to him).  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal with minimal risk."
