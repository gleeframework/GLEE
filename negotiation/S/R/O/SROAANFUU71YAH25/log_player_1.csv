Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a time pressure element, potentially encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
