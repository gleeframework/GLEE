"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation without risking losing the deal immediately.
* **Being open to counteroffers:**  The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion and a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There are still 8 rounds left, giving us room to negotiate a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is not feasible for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value the product brings to you.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** By coming down in price, I'm showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value the product brings to Bob to justify the price.
* **Creating urgency:** The ""let's find a way to make this work"" phrasing implies that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is close, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:** We have 6 rounds left. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't accept anything significantly below my minimum. 
* **Selling to John is tempting, but not yet:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 would be a good outcome, I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob. There's a chance I can improve the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,125,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I'm reminding Bob about the value he'll get from the product to justify the price. 
* **Creating urgency:**  The ""Let's close this deal"" phrasing adds a sense of urgency to push for a final agreement.
* **Staying firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going much lower than $1,200,000."
