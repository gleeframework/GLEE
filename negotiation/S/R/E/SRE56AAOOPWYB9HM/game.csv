"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is not feasible for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value the product brings to you.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is close, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,125,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
