"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our budget."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is not feasible for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value the product brings to you.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we're still slightly above our budget. We can try to negotiate a little further before resorting to John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is close, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,125,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our maximum budget. There's no point in negotiating further or going to John, as we won't get a better price."
