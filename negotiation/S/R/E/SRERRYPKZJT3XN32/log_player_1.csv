Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate, but it's also lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **The message** is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** I'm starting with a price that gives me a good profit margin while still leaving room for a deal.
* **Keep Bob interested:**  A price that's not too high will make Bob more likely to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Preserve my option to sell to John:**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  It would be a significant loss for me to sell at this point. 
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.**  I can try to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. 
* **Selling to John remains a backup option if the negotiation with Bob fails.**  I'm not in a rush to sell to Bob at a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work, but $10,500 is the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500 is a compromise:**  It's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a significant loss.
* **The message is firm but polite:**  It conveys my willingness to compromise while maintaining my desired price range. 
* **I'm signaling flexibility:** The message highlights my willingness to ""make this deal work.""

This approach aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  This counteroffer brings Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price while remaining within his budget.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** It signals that I'm open to negotiation but not at any price.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still able to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my desired price, but it's significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  I would lose $5,000 if I sell to John.
* **Selling to Bob at $10,000 is a reasonable compromise.** It's a good deal for me, especially considering the risk of continuing the negotiation.  I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob, and it's not guaranteed that John will still be willing to buy at $15,000.

This decision is based on:

* **Balancing profit and risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for.
* **Minimizing potential loss:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, ultimately resulting in a bigger loss.
* **Time and uncertainty:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision at this point. It ensures a decent profit without jeopardizing a potential sale altogether."
