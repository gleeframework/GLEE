"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you.  I'm offering it to you at $950,000, a price that reflects its incredible value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's discuss further.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $825,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product's value is undeniably high, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal.
