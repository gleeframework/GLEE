"Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you.  I'm offering it to you at $950,000, a price that reflects its incredible value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's discuss further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $950,000. Can we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $825,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product's value is undeniably high, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal.",887500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $950,000, which would be $887,500. However, I'm not willing to pay more than that. Can we try $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
