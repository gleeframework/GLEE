Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $950,000. Can we meet in the middle at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
