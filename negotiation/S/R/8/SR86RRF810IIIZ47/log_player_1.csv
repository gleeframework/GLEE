Bob's offer:

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $100, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $135? I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.

You have three options:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $125 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's still a $25 profit over my minimum and a decent margin.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time, and I have a guaranteed $100 with John.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to haggle risks Bob walking away, leaving me with the $100 offer. 

Accepting $125 secures a good deal now."
