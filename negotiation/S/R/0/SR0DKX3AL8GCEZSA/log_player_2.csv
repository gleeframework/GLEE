"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is far above your $100 limit and even above her own valuation.  It makes sense to negotiate lower. You have a good alternative with John at $100, so you have leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit of $80. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price and well below your $100 limit. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""I have a limit of..."") makes your counteroffer seem more reasonable and less like a random lowball.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The tone remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to your budget, it's still above your $100 limit. Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's a good chance you can get the price lower. You have a standing offer from John at $100, giving you leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, my absolute top limit is $95. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to buy."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still staying below your $100 limit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By presenting this as your ""absolute top limit"" and stating you're ""ready to buy,"" you signal that this is a serious offer and might be your final one.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate (Slightly):** While close to your limit, there's a small buffer for Alice to potentially counter if she's really motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm above your $100 limit.  While she might be willing to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $100, especially since she stated this is her final concession.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $100, so it makes sense to take that deal and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
