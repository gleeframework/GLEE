"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. It's also a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm offering $90, which is still above my minimum price and allows for further negotiation. This price also reflects the value the product has for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $70 is a big drop. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $80. There's no reason to continue negotiating, as I'm happy with this price and it's likely Bob won't offer more. Accepting his offer will allow me to close the deal and get the best possible price."
