,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit below my minimum. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
