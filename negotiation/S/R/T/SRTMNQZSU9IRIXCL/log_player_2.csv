# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price if you have any concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit below my minimum. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum.  He should try to counteroffer again and see if he can negotiate a price closer to his limit."
