Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to recover most of the value I place on the product while still being a significant savings for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights that this price is beneficial for both of us.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in a dialogue.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** The initial offer is high, giving me a good starting point. 
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** By not immediately resorting to John's offer, I keep the option of getting a better deal with Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Perspective:** I acknowledge that my product has value for Bob, which can encourage him to accept a price higher than his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired selling point. There's potential for further negotiation to secure a higher price. 
* **Avoid Settling:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but it's risky to assume I won't be able to get a better deal with Bob. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him, potentially bridging the gap between our desired prices.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my willingness to hold out for a better price, putting pressure on him to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** The next counteroffer will emphasize the product's value to Bob, while offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John is a safe option, but rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to maximize profits through continued negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This price still allows me to recover a significant portion of the value I place on it while remaining a considerable saving for you. Let's aim for a win-win situation!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my initial offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and move towards a potential agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:** I again emphasize the product's value to Bob while emphasizing the saving he'll get with this price.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a collaborative atmosphere, which is crucial for successful negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value I place on it with your need to recover some of the value you've invested in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.

* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our desired prices. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer again demonstrates my commitment to achieving a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:** My counteroffer will emphasize the value of the product to Bob while acknowledging his budget constraints. 
* **Balanced Approach:** I will propose a price that is slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $825,000 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll gain from it.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Impasse:** Bob has remained firm at his $825,000 offer, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to produce a better outcome.
* **Time and Resources:** Continued negotiation with Bob would consume time and energy without guaranteeing a favorable outcome.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Secure Profit:**  Selling to John ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, selling to John prevents a significant loss by accepting Bob's lower offer.
* **Time Efficiency:**  This decision avoids further negotiation with Bob, allowing me to move on to other opportunities."
