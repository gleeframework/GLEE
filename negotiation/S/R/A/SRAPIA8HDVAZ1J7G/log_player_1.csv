Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a higher price than John's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  By aiming higher, I maximize the chance of getting a better deal. 
* **Unknown value to Bob:** I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so I'm using a price that feels reasonable without being overly aggressive.
* **John as a safety net:** I know John will buy it for $1,200,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk by asking for more.

If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's offer, guaranteeing a profit of at least $1,200,000."
