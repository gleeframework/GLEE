"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle somewhere around $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
