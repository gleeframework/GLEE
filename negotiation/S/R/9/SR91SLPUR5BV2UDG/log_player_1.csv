Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond our minimum.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, hinting at its desirability and justifying the high price.
* **Alternative buyer:** By mentioning other potential buyers, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, setting the initial price too high could backfire and lead Bob to reject the offer outright. Gauging a buyer's negotiation style and risk tolerance is crucial in real-world scenarios."
