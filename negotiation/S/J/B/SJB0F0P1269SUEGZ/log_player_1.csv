Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is the lowest I can accept.  It seems we are at an impasse.
