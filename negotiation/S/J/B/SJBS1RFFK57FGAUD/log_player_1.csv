{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It allows for potential counteroffers and provides a starting point for further discussion.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:** This shows Bob you're open to finding a solution that benefits both parties.

Remember, the key is to be flexible and open to counteroffers while keeping your minimum price in mind."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely get a better price."

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I'll try to counteroffer once more before considering John's offer."
