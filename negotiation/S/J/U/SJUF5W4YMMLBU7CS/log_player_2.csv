"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $14,000 is under your $15,000 maximum, you can do better. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless the price is more attractive. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer.  If not, you can always buy from John for $15,000."
