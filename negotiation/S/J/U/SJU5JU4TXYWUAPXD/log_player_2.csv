"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is well over his budget, and he has a better option with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraint, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his preferred price point. He can still get a better deal from John, so he should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating or go with John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While $10,500 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still more than he's willing to pay. John offers a guaranteed lower price, making him the best option."
