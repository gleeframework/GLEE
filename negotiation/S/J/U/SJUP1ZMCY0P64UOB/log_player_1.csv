"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $100 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but $125 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $112.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $112.50 is closer to my target price, I'm still not comfortable with selling it below $125. It's a valuable product for me, and I think I can potentially get a better deal by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with going below $120. It's a good price for both of us, and it's still well within what I need to get for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to meet you at $115. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $115 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still think there's room for a better offer. I'm not in a rush to sell and John is still a viable option.  I'll see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $112. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** With only two rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get Bob to raise his offer to a price I'm comfortable with.  Since John is still willing to pay my minimum price, I'll sell to him to ensure I get the best possible outcome."
