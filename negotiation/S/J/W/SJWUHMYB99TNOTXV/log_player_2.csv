Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.
