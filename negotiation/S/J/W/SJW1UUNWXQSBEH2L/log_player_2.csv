"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a lower price, potentially closer to Alice's own valuation of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore that potential."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still leaves you with a good value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is a good price for Bob. It's still better than buying from John at $15,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in smaller price drops. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice walking away completely."
