Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate but still leaves you with a profitable sale.
* **It's a positive message:** This starts the negotiation on a friendly note. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than what I want to get. I'll make a counteroffer and try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still leaves you with a good value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows that you are willing to negotiate, but still want a better price. 
* **Is lower than your original offer:**  Shows you are willing to compromise.
* **Is a fair price for you:** $12,000 is still above your minimum of $10,000.

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
