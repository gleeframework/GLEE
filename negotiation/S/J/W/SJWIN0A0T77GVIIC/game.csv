"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500 to show my commitment to this sale. It's a fair price that still allows me to meet my minimum. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13500. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
