Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's offer allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""before anyone else"" and ""demand"" subtly pressures Bob to act quickly. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale if he declines."
