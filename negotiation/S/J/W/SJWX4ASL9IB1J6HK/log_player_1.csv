{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 180}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm only able to pay $150 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation: Bob is offering our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Selling to John guarantees us our desired profit with no further hassle."
