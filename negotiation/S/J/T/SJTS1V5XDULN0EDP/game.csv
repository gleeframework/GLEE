"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, I'm still having a hard time justifying anything over $10,000. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, so I'm offering it to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,5,
