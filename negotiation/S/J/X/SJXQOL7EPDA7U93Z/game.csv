"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a price of $14,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $13,000. Let me know if that's more acceptable to you!",13000.0,Alice,5,
