"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $14,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer,  $14,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $15,500. That way we both get a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $14,200 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this work, but $14,200 just doesn't cut it for me. Let's try to find a happy medium. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $14,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum, and with only four rounds left, I don't think I can get a better price from him.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's better than risking getting stuck with a lower price."
