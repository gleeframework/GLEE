Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  This product has significant intrinsic value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This offer reflects the true worth of the product while still providing you with a fair deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $950,000 falls significantly short of what I believe is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what I'm offering.
