"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  This product has significant intrinsic value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This offer reflects the true worth of the product while still providing you with a fair deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering both the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $950,000 falls significantly short of what I believe is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what I'm offering.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid we're too far apart on price. I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If this works for you, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
