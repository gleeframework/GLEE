"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I see the value in your product, $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I can do $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? That would be a fair price for both of us, and it'd be closer to my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
