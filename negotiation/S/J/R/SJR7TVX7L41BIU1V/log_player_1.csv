Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. It leaves room for negotiation while still offering a significant profit for me. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to Bob to make it more tempting for him to accept.  

Let me know if you want me to continue the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I see the value in your product, $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still less than what I'd like to get. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I can do $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? That would be a fair price for both of us, and it'd be closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000. It's time to take the deal!"
