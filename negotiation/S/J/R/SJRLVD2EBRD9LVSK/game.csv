"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is my best price for now.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. How about $1200000? It's a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway in the previous round, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1300000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1280000?",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the effort to meet halfway, but $1280000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1250000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1300000 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus that's worth $20000 to sweeten the deal?",1280000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm still trying to keep the price down. I'm willing to pay $1260000, which is closer to my target.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal quickly.",1260000.0,Bob,8,

I'm willing to throw in an additional bonus worth $15000 to sweeten the deal, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1300000 with the bonus, and we can finalize the deal?",1300000.0,Alice,9,
