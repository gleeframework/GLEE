While $13,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation to drive the price down closer to her value point."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is the best price we've seen so far, considering our initial budget of $15,000. It's a good deal compared to John's price and still leaves a little room for profit for Alice.  Accepting this offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
