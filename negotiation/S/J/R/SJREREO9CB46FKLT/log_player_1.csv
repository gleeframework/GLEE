Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
