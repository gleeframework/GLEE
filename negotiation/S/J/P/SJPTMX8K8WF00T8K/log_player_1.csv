"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a little, but $175 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to pay $185? "", ""product_price"": 185}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down a bit, but $185 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $180? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $180 isn't my ideal price, it's only $10 less than my last counteroffer and it's above my minimum price. It's better to close the deal now rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for $150."
