"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** The offer is close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it more tempting for him to accept. 
* **Confident Language:** The message uses positive language and avoids appearing desperate, conveying that you believe in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial ask and his perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  Show Bob that you're not willing to settle for a low price, emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Negotiating Room:**  There's still ample room for negotiation between $1,100,000 and $1,400,000.
* **John as Backup:**  You still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,100,000) and your previous ask ($1,400,000). It signals flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Justifying the Price:** The message reiterates the product's value,  providing a reason for the higher price.
* **Urgency (Subtle):** By stating ""to move this forward,"" you subtly introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value is high, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $1,150,000?  I feel this is a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Bob increased his offer by only $50,000, indicating he has room to move and may be willing to pay more. 
* **Above Minimum:** While $1,150,000 is a decent profit, you're still aiming to maximize your gains.
* **Time Remains:** You have several rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budgetary constraints,  the product's value remains non-negotiable. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to agree on $1,225,000.  This offer reflects my best effort to find a mutually beneficial outcome."", 
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're making a smaller concession ($75,000) this time, signaling that you're nearing your bottom line.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value while acknowledging Bob's position and offering a compromise.
* **""Final Offer"" Implication:**  The phrasing ""meet in the middle"" and ""best effort"" subtly imply that this is a strong offer and you might not be willing to go much lower.
* **Time Consideration:** As you progress through the rounds, it's strategic to guide the negotiation towards a close. This offer attempts to do that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to meet in the middle.  While $1,225,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,200,000. Would you be open to $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,175,000 is a significant profit margin, exceeding your minimum by $175,000.
* **Negotiation Pattern:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer in smaller increments, suggesting he's reaching his upper limit.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations further might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob, and risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting now secures a good profit. 
* **John as a Benchmark:** While John offers $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer gains you an extra $175,000 for relatively little additional risk at this point."
