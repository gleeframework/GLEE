Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a little high. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $1,250,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming closer.  To make a deal, I need to be closer to $1,100,000. Would you consider $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
At $1,175,000, we're close enough to my target price, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away. It's a good deal and time to accept."
