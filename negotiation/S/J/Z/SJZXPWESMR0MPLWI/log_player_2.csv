"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to pay less than $120.  While $100 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering $90 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $100, but still leaves room for Alice to potentially make a profit.  This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still remaining within your budget."
