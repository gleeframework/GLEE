Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price than my initial offer. It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $80 if I don't reach a deal with Bob. So, accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
