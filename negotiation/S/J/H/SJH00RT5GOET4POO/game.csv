"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000. Can we try $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers.  How about $15,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
