"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is asking for $14,000. This means you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
 
Alice has come down from $14,000 to $13,500, which is a good compromise. You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and $13,500 is still a good deal for you. It's worth accepting to save some money and avoid further negotiations."
