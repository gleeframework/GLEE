"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the value.  Since Bob values the product at $150, I'm leaving him some room to negotiate while still making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is still too low for me, as I want to earn more than $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130.  This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still holding firm on my desired profit margin."
