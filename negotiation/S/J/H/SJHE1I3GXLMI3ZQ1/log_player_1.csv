"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the point where I think I'd rather buy from John for $10000, but I'm still interested in your product. Can you meet me at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than what John is offering, and it's close enough to my minimum. I'll accept his offer."
