Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm happy to offer it to you at this price before exploring other options."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Maintain Value Perception:**  Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but justifying it with ""significant value"" and ""other options"" might encourage him to consider it more seriously. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
