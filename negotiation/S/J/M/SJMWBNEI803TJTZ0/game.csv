"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I'm interested,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1100000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $1000000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
