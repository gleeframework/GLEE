"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $900,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1050000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my preferred price point. While I would prefer a lower price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  This is a good compromise and still saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
