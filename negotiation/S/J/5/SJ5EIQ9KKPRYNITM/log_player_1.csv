While I could continue negotiating, accepting Bob's offer of $1,240,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) by a significant margin.  Continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk that Bob walks away, leaving me to accept John's offer."
