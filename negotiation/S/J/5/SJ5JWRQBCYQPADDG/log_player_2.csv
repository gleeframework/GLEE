"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,350,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price.** You can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet halfway at $1,175,000?  This reflects the product's value while still offering you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price.**  She's dropped from $1,350,000 to $1,175,000.
* **You're still saving a significant amount compared to John's price.**  You'd be paying $325,000 less.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation, but it might not be worth it.**  You could try to push for a lower price, but there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.

It's a good compromise and a solid deal for you."
