Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, but if you're not interested, I have another buyer ready to purchase."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Create Urgency:** Telling Bob about another buyer encourages him to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring the product is sold."
