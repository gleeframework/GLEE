{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $1,000,000 is more than the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your value:** $1,000,000 is less than the minimum you're willing to accept, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** The offer isn't too high or too low, making it more likely for Bob to engage in the negotiation.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if you can push the price closer to your ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly below your ideal value.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum, there's no rush to accept Bob's offer. You can use this opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but it's still lower than your previous offer, showing that you're also firm in your desire to get a better price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Price:** The offer of $950,000 is a middle ground between your previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This suggests a genuine desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose $920,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum, so there's no rush to accept Bob's offer. You can use this opportunity to push for a higher price.  

Since John will pay $1,200,000, you have more leverage to negotiate. It might be worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get Bob closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $940,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 940000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer represents a small compromise from your previous offer, showing flexibility while still advocating for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message highlights the value of the product for Bob and reaffirms the commitment to finding a fair price, aiming to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Price:** The offer of $940,000 is a middle ground between your previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $920,000.  This suggests a genuine desire to reach an agreement while still keeping the price above your minimum.

By offering $940,000 you're showing Bob you are willing to negotiate but you are also firm in your desire to get a better price. This approach might encourage Bob to accept, or it might lead to the final negotiation.  Remember, you can always sell to John if Bob doesn't accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to stay close to your asking price, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $920,000, so I'm proposing $960,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $960,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum, so there's no need to continue negotiating with Bob.  Selling to John ensures you get your minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
