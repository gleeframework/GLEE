Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still allows us to both get what we want. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further. $1,075,000 is still a little below my desired range, but I'm open to closing the deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,087,500? This would allow us both to walk away happy with the transaction.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has moved closer to my desired price range. Accepting her offer of $1,087,500 allows me to buy the product for a good price and avoid the risk of the negotiation breaking down or having to settle for John's higher price."
