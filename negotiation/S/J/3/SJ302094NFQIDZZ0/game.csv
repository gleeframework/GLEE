"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $9,500. This is a fair price that's closer to our desired price points.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can go as low as $10,250. I'm hoping this price works for you so we can close the deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
