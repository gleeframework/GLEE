Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $115, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

It's not worth haggling with Alice any further. She's unlikely to go much lower than $115, and you can get the product for $120 from John with no hassle."
