"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can negotiate a better price.  I have 8 more rounds, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $14,000.  Selling to John right now would be a sure thing, but it's not my best possible outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $13,500?  That's still a significant savings for you, and it allows me to move closer to my asking price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Would you consider $13,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is the same as his previous offer.  While I'd prefer $13,500, I'm starting to run out of time.  I'm confident that if I reject this offer, Bob might not budge further, and I could end up losing out on a good deal. It's better to secure the $13,000 now than risk getting nothing at all."
