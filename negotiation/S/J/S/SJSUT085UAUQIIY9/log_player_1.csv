Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. This helps to build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible.  
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer.  
* However, I'll also be keeping John's offer of $15,000 in mind and may choose to stop negotiating with Bob if the price doesn't get close enough to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept $8,000, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my target of $15,000. 
* I'll need to be strategic about how much I lower my price to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* I'll continue to keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer but significantly lower than my previous offer. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and highlighting the value for Bob. I'm also emphasizing that this is a good deal for him.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground between our positions. 
* By offering a price closer to Bob's, I hope to keep the negotiation going. 
* I'm still keeping John's offer of $15,000 in mind, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating."
