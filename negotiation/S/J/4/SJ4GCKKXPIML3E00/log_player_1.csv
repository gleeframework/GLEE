Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

I'm prepared to sell for $850,000. This still offers you a good deal, as it's well below my usual price. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
