"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  It's a significant discount from my usual asking price, and it's still well above your estimated value. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to sell for $850,000. This still offers you a good deal, as it's well below my usual price. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
