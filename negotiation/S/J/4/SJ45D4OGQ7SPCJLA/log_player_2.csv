# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a good deal considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer of $130 is less than its value to her, you can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John is the most cost-effective option."
