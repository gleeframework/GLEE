Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so I don't need to go below that price.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $119 leaves a little room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing my profit further. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
