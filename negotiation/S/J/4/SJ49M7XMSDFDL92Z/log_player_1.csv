{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the potential value to me, I'm willing to pay $1200000. This seems like a fair price considering your own stated valuation, and it provides you with a healthy profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, it's a bit lower than I'm willing to accept at this stage. However, I'm still open to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end. This would still provide you with a great value, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
