Round 2

# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves a substantial profit for you. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering you the product for $887,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 887500}

While I would have liked to secure a higher price, I've only got a few rounds left.  $880,000 is a reasonable compromise considering the value to Bob and my minimum acceptable price."
