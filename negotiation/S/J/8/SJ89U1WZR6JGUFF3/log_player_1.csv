Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives you a significant saving compared to my original offer.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $9,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $9,000 is a fair compromise and a good deal for me. It's better than selling to John for $10,000 and it's likely that if I reject Bob's offer, we'll end up back here after more negotiation."
