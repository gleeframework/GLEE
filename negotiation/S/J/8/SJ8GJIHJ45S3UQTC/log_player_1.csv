"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $1,300,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
