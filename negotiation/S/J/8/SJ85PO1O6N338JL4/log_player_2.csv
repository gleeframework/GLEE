You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not quite comfortable with $115, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $122, which is as low as I can go. That's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $122 saves money compared to John's $150 and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
