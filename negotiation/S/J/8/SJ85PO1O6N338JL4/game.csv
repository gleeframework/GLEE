"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $115? That's a fair deal for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not quite comfortable with $115, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $122, which is as low as I can go. That's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,5,
