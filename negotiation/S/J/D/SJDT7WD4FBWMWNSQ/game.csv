"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal,  $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll find this to be a good deal. ",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",9200.0,Alice,5,
