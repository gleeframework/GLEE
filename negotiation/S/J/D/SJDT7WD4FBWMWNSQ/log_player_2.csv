"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum of $8,000.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has a fallback option with John.  Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to try and further lower the price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she won't go below $9,200.  This is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, it's in his best interest to buy from John and save the remaining $1,200.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a lower price and risks losing the deal with John."
