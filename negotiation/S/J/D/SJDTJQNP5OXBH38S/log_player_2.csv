"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high.  It is still better than John's price but I can try to get it lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the product's potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice's offer is a good deal. It is still slightly higher than what I was hoping for, but it's lower than John's price and I can save a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer."
