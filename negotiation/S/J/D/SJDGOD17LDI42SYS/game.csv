"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss $14000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to let it go for.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $14000 is still a bit more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go to $13000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a persistent buyer, Bob, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13500? I think it's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to come down from my initial ask.",13500.0,Alice,5,
