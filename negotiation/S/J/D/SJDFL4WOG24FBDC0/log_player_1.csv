This offer starts at a strong price point, leaving room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a significant return on my investment.  It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a great product, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is a substantial amount, I'm confident I can secure a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While I value your business, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $900,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product will be a huge success for you.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower.  Let's try $875,000. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my initial price point that it's worth accepting.  While I'd love to get closer to my original ask, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John. This price ensures a strong profit for me and a good deal for Bob."
