{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** This price is below my minimum of $1,000,000, giving me some wiggle room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It leaves space for compromise:**  The offer leaves room for both of us to negotiate and find a price we're happy with.

By offering a price slightly above Bob's valuation, I'm aiming to get him to consider the offer while still keeping some negotiating leverage."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I want to try and secure a higher price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial desired price,  Bob seems determined to stay at a lower price point.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,000,000, it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Bob any longer.  I'm going to accept John's offer and move on."
