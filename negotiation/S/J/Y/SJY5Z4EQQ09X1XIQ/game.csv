"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to see some flexibility on the price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to my asking price of $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $775,000 as a compromise. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
