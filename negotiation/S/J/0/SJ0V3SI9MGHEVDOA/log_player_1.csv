Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  However, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate down from a higher starting point.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is designed to gauge Bob's interest level.  His response will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly states that you're open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob only values the product at $8,000. Your initial offer is significantly higher. Observe his reaction carefully.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Be prepared to negotiate. You might consider lowering your asking price in increments, but don't go below $15,000 (your guaranteed sale price to John). 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation while ensuring you don't lose out on a sale."
