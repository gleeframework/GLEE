"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering you the product for $105. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",97.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $100 for the product. That's the absolute lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
