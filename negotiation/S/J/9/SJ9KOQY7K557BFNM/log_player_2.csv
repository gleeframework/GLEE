"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $1,700,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still below its market value.  Consider this - you'd be saving $100,000 compared to my other buyer, John, who's willing to pay $1,800,000.  Let me know your decision.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
