Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still well above my minimum asking price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and while Bob is offering less, I still have leverage since my minimum is $1,200,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to my desired price point.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $1,275,000? I'm getting closer to my target, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'll try to get closer to my target by rejecting this offer and seeing if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $1,300,000?

Bob is sticking to his price, but I'm not ready to accept his offer. I'll try one more time to get a higher price before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. Let's try $1,290,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left to see if I can push for a higher price.  If it comes down to it, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000, but I need you to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000. This is my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is Bob's final offer, and it's very close to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, especially since John is also a potential buyer. Accepting Bob's offer will secure a sale and allow me to make a profit.  While I'd prefer a higher price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly better price."
