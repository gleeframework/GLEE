"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer saves you a substantial amount of money. There's no need to risk further negotiation or buying from John at a higher price."
