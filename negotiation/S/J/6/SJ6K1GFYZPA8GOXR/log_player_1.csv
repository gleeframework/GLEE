{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it could be a successful investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask. While it's above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, considering the unique value proposition of this product and its potential for return on investment, I'm looking for a price closer to $2,000,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,800,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is moving closer to my desired price range, but I believe there's still some room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal before accepting or considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000.  This offer reflects the product's value and shows my commitment to finalizing this deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting very close to my target, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting $1,850,000 ensures a significant profit above my minimum while avoiding the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing in later rounds."
