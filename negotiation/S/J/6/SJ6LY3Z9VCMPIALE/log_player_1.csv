Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for Bob to negotiate down or for you to make concessions and still stay above your baseline. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""given its value..."") can make it seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Phrases like ""What do you think?"" encourage Bob to engage in the conversation rather than just saying yes or no.

**Important Note:** While John represents a guaranteed $12,000, aiming higher with Bob is strategically sound. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance you can secure a better deal than with John."
