Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language (""great deal"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly states that I'm open to negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** By starting high, I have the opportunity to secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The response will tell me if Bob is truly interested or just curious. 
* **Set the Stage for Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not afraid to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Reasonable:** Bob's offer of $90 is within my acceptable range and is only $10 less than my initial asking price.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Accepting his offer avoids the potential for further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While $90 isn't the ideal price, it's still significantly better than selling to John for $80.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price for the product without risking further haggling or potential complications."
