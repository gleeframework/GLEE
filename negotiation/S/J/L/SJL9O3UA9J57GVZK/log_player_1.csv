"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a great deal considering its value."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport with Bob and create a more collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to subtly remind Bob of its worth, hopefully making him more willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can't afford $10,000 for the product. My budget is $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's not ideal. I want to maximize my profit.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **John as a safety net:** Having John's offer of $8,000 as a safety net means I'm not forced to accept Bob's offer. I can take the risk of further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial offers. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Value reminder:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the slightly higher price. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I really like the product, but I still can't go above $8,000. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob altogether. 
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, it's the same as Bob's current offer. Accepting Bob's offer secures a slightly higher price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
