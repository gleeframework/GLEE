"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $145. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $130 is still below my acceptable range. I'm going to reject his offer again and see if I can get him to budge a bit more. There are still several rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $140? It's closer to your offer, but it also allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. How about we meet at $135?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more. I have a few more rounds before I have to make a decision about selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $135 is still a bit below my acceptable range. Let's split the difference again - how about $137.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $137.50. How about we meet at $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal, but with only two rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  He's not willing to budge much, and even his final offer is still below my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150 to ensure I get a price that's at least worth my minimum value."
