"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $95 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. I'm willing to pay $90, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand the value you place on this product. In light of your offer, we propose a price of $92 for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $92 is closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows him to make another counteroffer and see if they can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm still hoping for a price closer to $90. Would you consider $91?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. After considering your latest offer, we would like to counter with a price of $93. This allows us to maintain our desired profit margin while still being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected several offers and made counteroffers. It's getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while he'd love to get it for $91, there's a risk Alice might get stubborn and he'll be forced to buy from John at $100. Accepting the $93 offer is a good compromise, securing the product at a price that's still within his budget."
