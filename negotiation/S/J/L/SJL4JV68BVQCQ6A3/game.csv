"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my offer of $800000.  I'm confident that this product is a great value at that price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, which is still a discount from my initial offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm going to stick with my offer of $850000.  It's a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from you. I'll meet you at $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear your concern, and I'm also eager to make a deal.  While $920000 is a bit outside my target,  I'm willing to go to $875000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, showing my willingness to meet you halfway.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and I'm glad to see some movement from you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $915000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings.
