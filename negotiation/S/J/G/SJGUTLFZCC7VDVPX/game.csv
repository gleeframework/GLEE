"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
