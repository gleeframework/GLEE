Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet at $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal given the value of the product.

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, his concessions are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to my minimum in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees my desired profit and avoids further negotiation risk."
