"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $9,000 for the product.  Let's try to find a compromise here.  ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still thinking $7,500 is a more reasonable price for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a good deal for both of us, as it allows me to recoup some of my investment and you get a good product at a reasonable price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500, so how about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,6,
