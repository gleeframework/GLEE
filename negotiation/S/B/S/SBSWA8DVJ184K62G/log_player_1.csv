{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum price.  This allows for some negotiation room while still leaving me with a decent profit. I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't interested, which will help me stay firm on my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a good price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $10,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of potentially losing out on a sale.  I think I can accept this offer and still make a decent profit."
