"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above my maximum price of $1,500,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  I have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on it."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement and I'll have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product while saving some money."
