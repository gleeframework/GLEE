"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $9,500.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, and $8,500 is closer to what I'm willing to accept. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. How about we split the difference at $9,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, which is as high as I'm comfortable going. I really like the product and would like to reach a deal with you. Can you meet me at $8,800?",8800.0,Bob,4,
