"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",

}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but need a price closer to my budget.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but she's still above my alternative option of buying from John for $10,000. I'll hold firm for now and see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, how about $9,500? "",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm inching closer to my walk-away point ($10,000 John price) but leaving a little room for one more potential counter from Alice. This shows her I'm still interested while maintaining pressure to lower the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as high as $9,500, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your budget limit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is not budging enough. Her latest offer of $10,800 is still worse than my guaranteed option of buying from John for $10,000. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice."
