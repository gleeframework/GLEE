"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me a good profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's important to start high and see how Bob reacts before I consider dropping my price."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that low right away. There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
