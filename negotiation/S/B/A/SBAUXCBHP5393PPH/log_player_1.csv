Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know its value is significant, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your operations. My asking price is $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's quality and potential for your business. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe it's a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a tough situation. While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my ideal selling price. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. I'm offering the product for $900,000. This price still gives you a good deal, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet you at $900,000. I would like to propose $850,000 as a compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's within my minimum acceptable price range, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better outcome.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
