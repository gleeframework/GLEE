"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the special price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. Even though $11,500 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $11,000? I'm confident we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $11,750 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $15,000 from John. 
* **Alice's Finality:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting offers.  

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's, maximizing his savings."
