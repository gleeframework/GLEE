"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the special price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $11,000? I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
