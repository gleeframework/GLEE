"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a living too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $12,625. This is my final concession, so let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",12625.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my target, but $12,625 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,375.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12375.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $12,500, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle this time.",12500.0,Alice,9,
