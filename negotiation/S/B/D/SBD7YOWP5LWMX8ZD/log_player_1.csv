Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000,  Alice knows she has a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John. Therefore, it makes sense to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying closer to Alice's desired outcome.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the ""value proposition"" to subtly justify the high price, even if Bob isn't fully aware of the product's worth to Alice.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes Bob is willing to negotiate. If Bob is known to be a tough negotiator who walks away easily, Alice might want to start lower.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell the product quickly, she might be more flexible on the price to avoid delays."
