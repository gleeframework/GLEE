I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still too low. Although I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
