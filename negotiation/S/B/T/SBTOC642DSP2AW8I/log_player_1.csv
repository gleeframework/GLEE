Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $135, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open Ended:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" gives Bob a chance to respond and helps keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still potentially getting a deal with Bob. By starting high, I can potentially get a price closer to my minimum while still keeping the door open for Bob to counter. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'm prepared to counter again, but I also have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below Bob's own perceived value of $120.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it signals that he is interested in the product. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Option to sell to John:**  Having John as a backup option provides leverage in my negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, while still showing willingness to negotiate. If Bob becomes too stubborn, I can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $125 is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's initial offer. It shows flexibility while still being profitable for me.
* **Highlight value:** I reiterate that $125 is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he would be getting.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  Using a friendly tone keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages Bob to respond.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance. It shows willingness to negotiate while keeping the price above Bob's perceived value, increasing my chances of getting a favorable deal."
