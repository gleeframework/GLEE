"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) as it's the opening round and I want to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** While this price is above Bob's perceived value, it's not so high that it makes him instantly reject the offer. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds. However, I also have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can't meet you at $1,200,000. My maximum budget for this product is $800,000. Could we find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, especially since I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay that price. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my position:**  I'm not letting Bob dictate the price.
* **Continue negotiating:** I have 8 more rounds to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Potentially get a better price:** By rejecting Bob's offer and countering, I might be able to push him higher.

In the next round, I'll carefully consider how much I want to lower my price based on the remaining rounds and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's true value and leaves room for a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise Language:** I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""work together"" to emphasize my desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify my price point. 

By offering $1,050,000, I'm:

* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above Bob's initial offer, but not so far away that it feels unreachable.
* **Leaving Room:** There's still room for negotiation in the remaining rounds. 
* **Showcasing Flexibility:**  I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to sell for too much less than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe $800,000 is a reasonable price. Could we perhaps negotiate closer to this amount? I'm open to discussing further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, I'm not willing to risk selling for less than my minimum just yet. 

Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Maintaining Position:**  I want to avoid setting a precedent of accepting prices below my minimum.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting, I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to continue negotiating.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can still push Bob to a more favorable price.

In the next round, I'll need to consider my remaining options carefully. If I keep rejecting offers, I risk losing Bob altogether. However, I also don't want to settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's current offer ($850,000).  This shows a strong commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging.

By offering $950,000, I'm:

* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm significantly closer to Bob's desired price, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above my minimum price of $1,000,000, but I'm demonstrating flexibility.
* **Creating Urgency:**  With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to increase my budget to $900,000. Is this within your range to make the deal happen? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, especially since I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price.

Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Maintaining Position:** I don't want to set a precedent of accepting prices below my minimum.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting, I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to continue negotiating.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There are still 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still push Bob to a more favorable price.  

I'm feeling confident that with some more negotiation, I can get a better deal. I'm also aware that the clock is ticking and I need to strike a balance between maintaining my price and securing a deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However,  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $975,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's make this deal happen.  Time is running out."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, creating urgency and a sense of finality.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Urgency:** I'm highlighting the limited time remaining and increasing the pressure to close the deal.

By offering $975,000, I'm:

* **Closing the Gap:** This is a significantly smaller gap between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above my minimum price of $1,000,000, but I'm demonstrating flexibility.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on to find a solution.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob to accept, knowing that he's getting closer to his desired price and that time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are in Round 8, with only 2 rounds left.  While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations is too high:

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, there's not enough time to get a better offer from Bob. 
* **No Guarantee of Success:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, even with a limited number of rounds left.
* **Safe Alternative:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations.

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I receive my minimum price and avoid the risk of losing a deal altogether."
