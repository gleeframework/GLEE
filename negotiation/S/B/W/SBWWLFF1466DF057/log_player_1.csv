{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $125? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired value of $100.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $125 is a little too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
