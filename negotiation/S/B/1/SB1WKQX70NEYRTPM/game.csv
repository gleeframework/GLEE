"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $100? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's right in the middle of our last two offers. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
