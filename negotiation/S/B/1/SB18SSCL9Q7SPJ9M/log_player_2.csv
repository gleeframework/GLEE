# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You know the product is worth no more than $800,000 to you, so accepting Alice's offer would be a bad deal. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.

While $850,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum value.  You should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for that $800,000 price point."
