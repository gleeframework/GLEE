"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:** This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It tests Bob's interest:**  If he's truly interested, he might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects it outright, it gives me information about his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price. Bob's offer shows he's interested, but I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum just yet.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,800. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. We're getting close to a deal, and this counteroffer hopefully pushes us over the edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,700.  We're now within a very small margin of my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  It's time to secure the sale."
