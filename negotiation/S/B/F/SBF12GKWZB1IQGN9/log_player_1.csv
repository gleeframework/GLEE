Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $12,000 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a premium over his perceived value to secure the product immediately.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a price point that:
    * Offers Bob a potential ""deal"" since it's less than his perceived $12,000 value.
    * Earns you a significant profit, more than you'd make selling to John.
* **Framing:**  The message implies scarcity and value by mentioning listing it publicly and highlighting the ""special price."" 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale at a higher price and ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
