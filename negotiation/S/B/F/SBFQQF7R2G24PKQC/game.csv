"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise slightly.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,000,000. This price still offers a significant opportunity for you, and it's closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're willing to consider this revised offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
