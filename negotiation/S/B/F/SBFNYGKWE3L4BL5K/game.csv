"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product.  However, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $11,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to your business, while also being more affordable for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm happy to go up to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow me to close the deal quickly.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $11,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm firm at $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm at $11,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",11100.0,Alice,7,
