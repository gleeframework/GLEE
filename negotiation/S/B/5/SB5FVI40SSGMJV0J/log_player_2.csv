"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with $1,200,000, which reflects its value and potential. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is higher than your maximum valuation and significantly higher than John's offer.  There's ample room for negotiation. By rejecting, you signal that her initial offer is unacceptable and open the door for a counter-offer that's more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I think that's fair considering it's well below your asking price, but still demonstrates my strong interest."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchor Low:**  By starting significantly below your maximum, you establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room to move upwards in later rounds while still potentially securing a price well below John's offer.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief and reasonable justification for your offer can make it more persuasive.  
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a collaborative and positive tone encourages Alice to continue negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your backup price. While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee, and you risk losing the opportunity. Accepting now ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
