Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the opportunity to potentially earn more.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which still gives you a great value. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below $12,000. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
