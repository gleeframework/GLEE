Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as valuable or if he needs it urgently. 
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, ensuring you won't lose out if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be very price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower, but still above your minimum.
* **Product Demand:** If the product is in high demand, you can be more confident in your higher offer."
