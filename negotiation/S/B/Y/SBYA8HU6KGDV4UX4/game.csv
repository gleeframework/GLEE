"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to your business. I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This reflects the product's exceptional quality and potential for your success.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about $900,000? This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's try to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a lower price. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This would allow us to both walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $875,000 is getting closer, but I need a bit more to make this work.  How about we settle on $890,000?  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to move forward. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a fair compromise that's in both of our interests. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",880000.0,Bob,6,
