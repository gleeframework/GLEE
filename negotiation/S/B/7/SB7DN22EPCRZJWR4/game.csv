"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 was a bit steep for you. However, I've thought about it and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value in your product, $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, but you're getting close to your budget limit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $785,000. This is the last time I'm willing to budge, so I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",785000.0,Alice,5,,
