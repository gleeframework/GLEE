"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the price you're willing to pay ($1,200,000). However, it's worth exploring further negotiation since you have 10 rounds to find a more favorable price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a healthy profit margin for you."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $825000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high. To make progress, I'd like to offer $775,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable outcome. I believe we can reach a final agreement if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 775000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. After re-evaluating the market and our conversation, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm proposing a new price of $790000. This price is closer to your target, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $790,000 is within your budget and a good deal considering you have only 5 rounds left.  While you could potentially negotiate a bit lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price outweighs the potential savings."
