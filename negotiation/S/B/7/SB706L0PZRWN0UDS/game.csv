"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'd be willing to offer $750000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a healthy profit margin for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $825000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your concerns about the initial offer. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high. To make progress, I'd like to offer $775000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable outcome. I believe we can reach a final agreement if we continue to work together.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. After re-evaluating the market and our conversation, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm proposing a new price of $790000. This price is closer to your target, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",790000.0,Alice,5,
