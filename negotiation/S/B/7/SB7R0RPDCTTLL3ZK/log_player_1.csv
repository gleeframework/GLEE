Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000), so there's space for a counteroffer.
* **Building Rapport:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, aiming to establish a positive negotiation environment. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, giving me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but based on my budget, I am only able to offer $950000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity to improve the deal:** I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John is still an option:** If the negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.  

**Next Round:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum. I'll try to find a middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial price ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000).
* **Showing Flexibility:** I've lowered my price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and reach a deal.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose too much.
* **Continuing the Conversation:** The message is friendly and encouraging further discussion, hoping to close the gap."
