{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John is a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity to justify the high price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision faster. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob will likely try to negotiate down from the offered price, knowing his maximum valuation is $1,000,000. Be prepared to counter-offer.
* **Relationship Building:**  While aiming for the highest price, consider the long-term implications. A positive negotiation experience could lead to future opportunities with Bob."
