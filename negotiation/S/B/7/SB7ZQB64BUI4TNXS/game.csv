"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $8,500? I'm confident it's a fair price for the value you'll get.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Alice,5,
