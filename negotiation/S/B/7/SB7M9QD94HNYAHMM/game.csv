"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,025,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",2025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit off from that. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,700,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's make this work - how about $1,900,000?  This is a very competitive price considering the product's unique value.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
