Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also halfway between my minimum and what I know the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly but firm, highlighting the value to Bob and setting the stage for potential negotiation. 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* It gives Bob a reason to consider accepting the deal, as it's lower than the product's worth to him.
* It leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a good offer and better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:**  This is a counteroffer that is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). It shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message maintains a friendly tone while firmly stating my position. It also highlights the value for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit of this deal.

By making this counteroffer, I'm:

* Showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* Positioning myself to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* Testing Bob's willingness to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $10000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my desired price, and it's significantly higher than selling to John. There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I might end up selling to John at a much lower price.  It's a good compromise that allows me to secure a good deal."
