"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is her highest valuation. There's room for negotiation to get closer to my $10,000 limit. Buying from John right away would mean missing out on a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a lower offer ($8,000) to see how much Alice is willing to move from her initial price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant saving if accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved closer to my range, but I can still try to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to risk another round since her offer is still $500 over my limit, and I have the John option as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. How about we settle at $9,250? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between her current offer ($10,500) and my previous offer ($8,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $9,250 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great price for a product of this value, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my target price!  There's no point in rejecting this offer since I can't get a better deal from John.  It's time to accept and consider it a successful negotiation."
