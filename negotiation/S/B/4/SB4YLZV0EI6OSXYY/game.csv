"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that makes this a win-win for both of us. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,025,000. I believe this offer is fair and allows us to close the deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there at $1,075,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $1,050,000. This offer is a good compromise and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,075,000 was too low, I'm going to offer $1,100,000 was also too high, I'm going to offer $1,062,500. This is my final offer.",1062500.0,Alice,7,
