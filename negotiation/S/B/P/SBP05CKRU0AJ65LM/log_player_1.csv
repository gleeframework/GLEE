Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know this is a premium over its base value, but I believe its unique features and benefits justify the price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to get you to lower the price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique features and benefits,"" you are creating a perceived higher value for Bob, even though you haven't explicitly stated what those are.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but inquisitive (""What do you think?""), signaling your willingness to hear Bob's perspective and potentially negotiate.

**Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell it to John for $8,000, your minimum acceptable price.

**Best Case Scenario:** Bob accepts the offer, and you make a $2,000 profit over your minimum."
