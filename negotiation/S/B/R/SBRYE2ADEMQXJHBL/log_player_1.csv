Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.  I believe Bob will be tempted to negotiate, as he values the product at $1,200,000.  However, if he rejects, I can always fall back on John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'll counteroffer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price.  It's still possible to get a better deal from Bob, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm countering with $1,550,000. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal. It's a good outcome considering I could have sold to John for the same price, but this avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
