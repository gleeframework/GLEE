Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than $80, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're willing to take $100, which is still higher than what you'd get from John.
* **It's a clear offer:** The message is friendly and straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand. 

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Maximizes your potential profit:**  You might be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob, or you have a guaranteed sale to John if Bob rejects your offer.
* **Keeps the negotiation open:**  By not starting with your highest price, you allow room for negotiation and potentially a mutually beneficial deal."
