"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident you'll find this is a great deal, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is the best option as it saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John.  Furthermore, there is no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is too high."
