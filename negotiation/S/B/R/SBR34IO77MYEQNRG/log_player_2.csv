"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget, and there's a significant margin for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to get a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I believe this represents a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product and the original price I had in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While there's potential for further negotiation, Bob has already made a counteroffer and is aware that Alice is willing to negotiate. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, as it guarantees him the product at his desired price and avoids further negotiation."
