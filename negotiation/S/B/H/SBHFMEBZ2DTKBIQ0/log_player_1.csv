"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  It's still a good deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $95 is a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $92. Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $100, Bob has come up to $92, which is a fair price given his initial offer and the limited rounds left. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
