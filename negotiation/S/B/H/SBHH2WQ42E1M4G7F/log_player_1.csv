Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches John's offer, we are still early in the negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product and has steadily increased his offer. There's room to push for a slightly higher price before accepting his offer or going with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but the value of this product is undeniable.  How about we split the difference and settle at $837,500?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $825,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation. Accepting at $825,000 secures a profit above our safety net ($800,000 from John) and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer later or the negotiation reaching a stalemate."
