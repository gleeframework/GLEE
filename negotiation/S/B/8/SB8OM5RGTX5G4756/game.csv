"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal happen. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
