"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $800,000. I'm confident I can get a better price, or at least a price closer to my minimum, with further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal happen. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
