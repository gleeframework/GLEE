Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm happy to discuss a price that reflects that.  How about we start the conversation at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,400,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still very profitable for you.
* **Value emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to discussion:** By framing it as a ""starting point"" and inviting discussion, you appear flexible and encourage Bob to engage. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a strong chance of a successful sale."
