Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $15,000 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's really interested, getting Alice closer to her $15,000 minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While Alice could start higher, asking for a price too close to $15,000 might make Bob lose interest completely, especially since he only values it at $12,000."
