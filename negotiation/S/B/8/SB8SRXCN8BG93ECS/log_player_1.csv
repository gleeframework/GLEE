Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a price I'm willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob has repeatedly refused to budge on his price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
