"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10250? This would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a price I'm willing to consider.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $10000, but that's my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
