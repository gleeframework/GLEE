"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $12000, but I know it's also worth $12000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you get it for a fair price and I make a little extra. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,1,
