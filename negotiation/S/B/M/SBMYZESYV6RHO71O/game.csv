"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense potential and value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise, considering its potential worth to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your position, and I want to make this deal happen. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,137,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair reflection of the product's worth.",1137500.0,Alice,5,
