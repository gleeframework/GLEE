Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
