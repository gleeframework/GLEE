"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice's offer of $180 is far too high. You'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $120? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $160, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go over $140.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $155, and that's as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
