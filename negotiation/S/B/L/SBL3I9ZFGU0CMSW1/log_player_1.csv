"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob can make him more interested.

**Note:** This is just the first offer, and I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not my ideal outcome. 
* **Opportunity for a better price:** There are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John is a safety net:**  While I'm aiming for a better price, John's offer provides a safety net. I can still sell to him if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $9,000 is closer, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? It's a compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and justification:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm also providing a reason for my counteroffer by emphasizing the product's uniqueness and the need for a fair price.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement, which can encourage Bob to be more receptive to the offer.
* **Building towards a deal:**  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I have a clear understanding of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $8,800 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher offer. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, selling to John for $8,000 is still a viable option. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** I've shown flexibility in my previous offers. There's a chance Bob will increase his offer if I hold firm. 

I'm willing to risk losing some of the potential profit to see if I can get a better price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,800 is a bit too low for me to accept.  Would you be willing to consider $9,200?  This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a higher price:** I'm offering a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give in too quickly.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  The message continues to highlight the desire for a win-win scenario,  reinforcing the idea that a slightly higher price benefits both of us.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** My message demonstrates that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Limited time pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is starting to mount. I need to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's offer:** While Bob's offer is only $500 less than John's offer, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. 
* **Limited time:** We're down to 4 rounds, but I believe there's still a possibility of getting closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not ready to settle yet. This might make Bob reconsider and potentially increase his offer. 

I'm taking a calculated risk by rejecting Bob's offer, but I think it's worth it to try to get a higher price in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and I want to make this work. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $8,750.  This would give us both a good outcome and allow us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm proposing a price that is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Focus on a ""good outcome"":** The message emphasizes that $8,750 would be a good outcome for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Time pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to reach a deal.  I'm also showing that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Near John's offer:** This offer is closer to John's price, giving me a better alternative if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to the last two rounds.
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,250 is a significant drop from my previous counteroffer and much closer to my absolute minimum.
* **John's offer is the safer choice:** While I would prefer a higher price, John's offer of $8,000 guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiation. 

Given the limited time and the risk of losing the deal entirely, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure the sale."
