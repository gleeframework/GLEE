"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price of $800,000 as possible. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount of money.  You want to try and get a better price.
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds, giving you plenty of opportunity to negotiate. 
* **John's price is a safety net:** You have a backup option in John, so there's no immediate need to accept a high offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit short of my minimum price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's a slight improvement, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. 
* **More room for negotiation:** We've only had three rounds, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **John's price is still a backup:** I'm not in a rush to buy, so I can continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $885,000. This is a slight compromise, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** $885,000 is only $15,000 away from my last counteroffer.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **John's price is still looming:** If I keep rejecting Alice, I might be forced to buy from John for a higher price.

While I'd prefer to pay a bit less,  accepting this offer is the most strategic move at this point. It secures the product while keeping the cost relatively low."
