"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can try to get a better deal from Alice.  $120 is too high for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  This would still be a good deal for both of us, I think. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$105 is a good price for the product, especially since it's lower than John's offer.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you money."
