Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've chosen $120 as my initial offer. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price that's good for both of us. 
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and open-ended, encouraging Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  By starting with a higher price, I have more room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Be friendly:** Maintaining a positive tone will hopefully keep the negotiation from becoming adversarial.
* **Leave it open-ended:**  This encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is higher than John's offer of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum price. This might encourage him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  This would still be a good deal for both of us, I think. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've countered with $105, which is exactly halfway between my last offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Message:**  I've kept the message positive and focused on finding a solution that benefits both of us. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm aiming to reach a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price ($80) but still appealing to Bob, who values the product at $150. This strategy tries to find a balance between my goal of maximizing profit and Bob's willingness to pay."
