"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value for you. Given its importance to you, I believe it's important to find a fair price that respects both our interests. After careful consideration, I propose selling the product to you for $12,000. This price reflects the product's worth while also allowing me to gain a reasonable profit. I understand this might be higher than what you were expecting, but I assure you, it's a fair deal considering the value it holds for you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You're saving $3,000 by buying from Alice.
* **You're still getting a good deal.** While Alice's offer is higher than her valuation, it's still within your budget and significantly less than what John is charging."
