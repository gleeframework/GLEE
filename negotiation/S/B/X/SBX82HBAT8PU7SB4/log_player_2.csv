"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than my budget and what I might be able to get it for from John. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to me."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to my price range, $900,000 is still significantly more than John's offer. I'll reject and counteroffer to see if I can negotiate closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I can go up to $700,000.  This offer reflects the serious interest I have in this product, while also staying within a reasonable budget."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, potentially missing out on the product entirely. Buying from John for $800,000 is the safer and more financially sound option at this point."
