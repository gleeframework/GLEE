"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $8,000 for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. How about we split the difference and go with $7,750?  It's a fair price that reflects both our needs, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm proposing a price of $8,250 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle again.",8250.0,Alice,5,
