"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $8,500 is a good deal, there's room for improvement. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $8,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $8,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to his target of $7,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. How about we split the difference and go with $7,750?  It's a fair price that reflects both our needs, and it would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm proposing a price of $8,250 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to get the price down to $7,500. While $8,250 is not his ideal price, it's getting close.  Considering that there are only 5 rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer will get Bob the product for a price he can live with and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
