"Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,000,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
