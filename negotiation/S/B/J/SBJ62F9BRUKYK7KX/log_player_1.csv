Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price.
* **Our Minimum:** We're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so we shouldn't offer a price below that.
* **Targeting High:** Starting with a strong offer of $12,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still securing a significant profit. This strategy aims to maximize our potential earnings from Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility (""Let me know what you think"") to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation if he finds the initial price slightly high."
