"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think you'll find it valuable. How about $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $180. That's way too high. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $130.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a very fair offer considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum value of $120. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only comfortable going up to $140.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 140}
