Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $10,000, it implies value by mentioning ""significant value"" and potential benefits. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's little risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  You don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above $8,000.  There's a chance he'll reject this offer outright.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You might have to lower your price, but always aim to stay above your $8,000 minimum."
