Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while staying above your minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value.
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, you have a guaranteed sale with John at $120."
