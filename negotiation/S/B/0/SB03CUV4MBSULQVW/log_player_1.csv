Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great value for you. Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

While $1,175,000 is less than I'd ideally like, it's closer to my minimum than John's offer.  It's also a good compromise considering the back-and-forth with Bob."
