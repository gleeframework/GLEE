"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 just doesn't work for me. Considering the value this product offers you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? ",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $725,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $787,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within your budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",787500.0,Alice,5,
