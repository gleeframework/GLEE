"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down to $150? ",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $150 is a little lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and go with $175?  I'm sure you'll find this is a great deal for such a fantastic product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $160, which would be a fair compromise. What do you think?",160.0,Bob,4,
