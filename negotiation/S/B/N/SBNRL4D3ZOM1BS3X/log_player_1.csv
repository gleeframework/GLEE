Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 3

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I'm hoping we can find some middle ground. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1,350,000. This shows how serious I am about acquiring the product. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the risk of him not reaching a suitable price in the remaining rounds outweighs the potential gain of continuing negotiations.  

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I meet my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
