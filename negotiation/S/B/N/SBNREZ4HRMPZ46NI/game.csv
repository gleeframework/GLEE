,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for it.  Let's meet in the middle and I'll sell it to you for that price.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to get at least $100 for it.  Let's split the difference and I'll sell it to you for that price.",100.0,Alice,5,
