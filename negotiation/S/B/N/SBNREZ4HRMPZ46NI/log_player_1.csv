"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $60 is far below my minimum price of $150. I'll try to get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for it.  Let's meet in the middle and I'll sell it to you for that price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

While $80 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to get at least $100 for it.  Let's split the difference and I'll sell it to you for that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob. I will try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 still isn't quite enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $95. This is a final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to pay more than $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to come up to my minimum acceptable price. I have only a few rounds left, and I risk getting a lower price if I continue negotiating with Bob.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee a profit."
