{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth it for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly lower than my minimum threshold ($15,000), giving Bob a bit of room for negotiation. However, it's still a good price for me, allowing for potential profit while also making it attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is more than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, it's far below my minimum of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price still allows me to cover my costs and makes it a great value for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $11,250 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. At this point, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I reach my desired minimum profit."
