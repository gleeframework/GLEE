"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,500,000.  This is too high of a price.  Bob should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still more than what the product is worth to him.  Bob should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his desired $1,000,000."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his desired price,  $1,250,000 is still more than what the product is worth to him.  He should counteroffer one last time, aiming for a price closer to his $1,000,000 mark. If Alice doesn't accept, he can always buy from John."
