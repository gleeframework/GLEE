Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so any price below that gives him a potential gain. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $10,000, as you have a backup buyer in John.
* **Negotiation Space:** Offering $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 

This approach maximizes your potential earnings while also giving Bob a reason to accept the offer."
