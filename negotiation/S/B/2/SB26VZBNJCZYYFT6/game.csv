"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7250.0,Alice,3,
