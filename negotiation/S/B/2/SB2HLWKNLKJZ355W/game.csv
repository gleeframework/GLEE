Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
