"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. Would you consider $100? This would be a fair price that would allow both of us to get what we want.",100.0,Alice,5,
