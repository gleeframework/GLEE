"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford $2000000. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can pay.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is the lowest price I can offer while still covering my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $1400000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $800000.  This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. This is my final counteroffer. I believe the product's value justifies this price, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
