"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I believe it's worth a lot to the right buyer. I'm offering it to you for $18000.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product looks great, but $18000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in buying, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is far too low.  It doesn't even cover my costs. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $14000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to cover your costs, but $14000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, but I can't go any higher.  This is a fair offer considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer of $10000, but it's still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and gives you a great deal on this product.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go to $11000, which is my absolute limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to look at other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,
