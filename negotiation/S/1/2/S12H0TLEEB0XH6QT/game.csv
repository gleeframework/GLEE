"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it can transform your operations. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that initial price is quite steep. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the initial price.  To be frank, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite a ways apart. To be realistic, I can't go higher than $700,000 at this time.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I recognize we're still bridging a gap here. I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. How about we consider $1,000,000? This would be my final offer as it's the absolute lowest I can go.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit rich for me.  I could potentially stretch to $750,000, but that's truly my limit.",750000.0,Bob,6,
