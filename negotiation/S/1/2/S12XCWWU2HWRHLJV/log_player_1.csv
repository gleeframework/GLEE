"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to negotiate down from his value of $15,000, and this offer gives him a good incentive to do so."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I hope this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. The negotiation is moving in the right direction, and I'm confident that I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my desired price.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, so I'm trying to reach an agreement with Bob before I have to take his offer."
