Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to take Bob's offer and get $850,000 for the product.  While you could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely or that you'll end up with a worse deal. $850,000 is a good price and guarantees a sale."
