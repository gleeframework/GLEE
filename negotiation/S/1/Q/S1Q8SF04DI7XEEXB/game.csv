"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. To be honest, $825,000 is at the top of my budget. Would you meet me in the middle at $800,000 and we'll close the deal?",800000.0,Bob,6,
