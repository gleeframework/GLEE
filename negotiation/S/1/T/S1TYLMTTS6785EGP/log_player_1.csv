Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want.  It's still a bit less than my ideal price, but it's worth taking.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that I might not get a better offer and end up having to sell to John for less."
