"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit more than I was hoping for.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a lot lower than that. Would you consider $8,000?  That's my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product has a lot of value, and I'm confident it would benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more sense for Bob to go with the sure thing.  There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
