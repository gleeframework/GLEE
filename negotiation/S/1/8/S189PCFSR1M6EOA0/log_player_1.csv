Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will be telling. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects outright, you can always negotiate down towards $8,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The safety net of John ensures you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum."
