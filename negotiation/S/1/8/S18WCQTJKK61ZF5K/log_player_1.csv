I'm offering Bob the product for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I want to maximize my profit while keeping in mind the value the product holds for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing the negotiation and sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still gives me a decent profit while being closer to Bob's offer. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but also not too low to be disadvantageous for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price and continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal entirely. Selling to Bob for $9,000 is still a good outcome, as it's a significant profit over selling to John."
