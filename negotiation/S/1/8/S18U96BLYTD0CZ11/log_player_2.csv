Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below its value. I could meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
