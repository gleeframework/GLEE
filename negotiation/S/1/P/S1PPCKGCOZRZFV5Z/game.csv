"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, and I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my spending limits.",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to increase your offer. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm confident that this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $850,000 is pushing my absolute limit. I'd be willing to offer $750,000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,,
