"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider at this time. However, I am still interested in finding a solution that works for both of us. I am willing to lower my price to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it reflects my desire to work with you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
