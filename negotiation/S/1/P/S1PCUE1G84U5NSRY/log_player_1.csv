Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $8,500 is still below my minimum, and I have more negotiating rounds to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm also aware of the option to sell to John for $10,000, which is always in the back of my mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $8,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about we meet at $8,750 again? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not going any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure we'll reach a deal.  I'm going to go ahead and sell to John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed sale and I'm comfortable with the price."
