"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $8,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's close this now.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about we meet at $8,750 again? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not going any higher.",8750.0,Bob,6,
