"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. This aligns more closely with what I believe the product is worth to me. I look forward to your response.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering you value the product at $15,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $12,000 is a fair price for the product. I value it less than you do, but I'm not willing to pay more than $12,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
