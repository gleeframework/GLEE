{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you're willing to compromise, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. This aligns more closely with what I believe the product is worth to me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $12,000 as he valued the product at $15,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering you value the product at $15,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $12,000 is a fair price for the product. I value it less than you do, but I'm not willing to pay more than $12,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm at $12,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than that. It seems like we've reached an impasse.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not risking further negotiations that could lead to a complete breakdown.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the most sensible choice at this point."
