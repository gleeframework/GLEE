"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $90. This is a good deal, but Bob can potentially get an even better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a little less.  How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $92. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not the best deal.  Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get the price down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88? "", ""product_price"": 88} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $91. It's a great deal that's still beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $91 is still more than Bob's ideal price, it's a good deal compared to buying from John for $120. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, and the difference in price is relatively small."
