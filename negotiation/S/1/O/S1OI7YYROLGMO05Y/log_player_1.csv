{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You're willing to sell for at least $10,000, so you have some wiggle room.
* **It leaves room for counter-offers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. It shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:** $9,250 is above my minimum of $10,000, but it's also a price I'm willing to consider given the potential for a quick deal with Bob. 
* **Open to further discussion:** The message emphasizes that I'm willing to keep negotiating to find a solution we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $8800? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm still willing to negotiate and see if we can find a more agreeable number. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'm confident I can get a higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to consider other options.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer is a final attempt to meet Bob halfway. It's only $200 above his offer, but it's a significant step towards my desired price.
* **Emphasizing a Decision:**  The message stresses that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, I will have to consider other options, subtly reminding him of John's offer.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  Offering $9,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on my minimum price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go up to $9000. I'm willing to meet you at $8800, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's not willing to go any higher than $8,800.  While that's not a terrible price, it's still below my desired minimum. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $10,000, it makes more sense to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John.  This guarantees me the best possible price and avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation."
