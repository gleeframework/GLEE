"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $12,000 to you. Considering this, I propose to sell it to you for $14,000. This price reflects the product's true worth while ensuring a fair profit for us. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's desired price of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $12,000.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within the budget:** Bob's counteroffer is still lower than Alice's initial offer but is closer to her valuation of the product.
* **Reasonable compromise:** The offer of $12,500 presents a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.
* **Staying flexible:** This counteroffer provides Alice with an opportunity to come back with a slightly higher price without jeopardizing the negotiation."
