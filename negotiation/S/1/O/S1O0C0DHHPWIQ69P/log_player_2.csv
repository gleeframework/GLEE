Alice's starting offer is still a significant markup from her perceived value. It makes sense to negotiate further to try and get a lower price."

While Alice has come down slightly, we're still too far from her perceived value of the product. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and the price is getting close to the point where it's no longer worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $9,200 secures a reasonable price compared to John's offer."
