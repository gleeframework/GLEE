Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better offer from Bob.  We're not at the point where taking a loss with John makes sense."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's getting close to the wire, and Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  Taking the $1,050,000 offer is better than risking a lower offer or having to go with John at $1,000,000."
