Alice's offer:

You should reject Alice's offer.  You are still closer to your desired price ($8,500) than Alice is to her minimum ($9,200). It's worth continuing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you are still closer to your ideal price ($8,500) than Alice is to her minimum ($9,200), the difference is now small enough to make it worth accepting.  If you reject this offer, you risk Alice walking away from the negotiation altogether, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
