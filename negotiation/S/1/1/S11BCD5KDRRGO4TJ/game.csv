"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a reasonable price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still a bit low.  To make this work for me, I'd need $825,000.  That's a fair compromise that gives you a great deal while ensuring I get a reasonable price.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
