"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range right now.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $1,010,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to meet me at $1,010,000. However, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,015,000.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
