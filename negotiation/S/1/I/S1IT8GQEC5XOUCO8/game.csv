"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm only comfortable going up to $860,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to an agreement, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I believe this is the minimum price that reflects the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $882,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",882500.0,Alice,5,
