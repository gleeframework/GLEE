"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than the maximum he's willing to pay, it's still more than Alice's perceived value of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still closer to the higher end of Bob's acceptable range.  Since there are still rounds available, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm only comfortable going up to $860,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 860000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to an agreement, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I believe this is the minimum price that reflects the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $882,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $882,500 is still within Bob's acceptable range, and significantly lower than the $1,000,000 he'd pay to John.
* **Negotiation:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or potentially a higher price if Alice becomes more insistent. 
* **Risk:**  There's a chance Alice might not budge further.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
