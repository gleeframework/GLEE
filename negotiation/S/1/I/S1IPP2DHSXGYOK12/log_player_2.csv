"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

It's not worth paying more than your maximum price to Alice.  You'll counteroffer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, and it's my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is now at your maximum price. You can either accept it or move on to John.  Since John is also offering the product at your maximum price, there's no advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
