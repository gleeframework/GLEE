"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8750.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make it happen!",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to go up to $8200, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any room for further negotiation?",8200.0,Bob,6,
