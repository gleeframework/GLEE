"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
