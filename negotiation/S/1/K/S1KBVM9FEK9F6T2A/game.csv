"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in it.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $7,500 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value, I think I can offer you a slightly better deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
