Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,500,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the value I place on the product and our potential for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that works for both of us. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price."
