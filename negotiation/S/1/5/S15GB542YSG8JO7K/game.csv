"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,500,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the value I place on the product and our potential for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
