"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it, given its value to me. What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $165 for the product. It's a great value and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $157.50?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",157.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $157.50. I can do $160, which is still a great value for the product. I think it's worth it for both of us. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
