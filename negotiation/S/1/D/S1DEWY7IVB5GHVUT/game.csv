"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's keep talking!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. Can you meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference again and settle on $9,000. This gives you a great price on a valuable product, and it gets me closer to my target.  I'm eager to close this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,5,
