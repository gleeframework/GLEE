Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" aims to justify the high price tag, even if Bob is unaware of its true worth to you. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a seemingly reasonable deal. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John at your desired price."
