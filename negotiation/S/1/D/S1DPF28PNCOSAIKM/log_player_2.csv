"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
