Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Considering its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for higher profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a chance he might pay a premium if he perceives its value to be even higher or needs it urgently. 
* **Limited-time pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a quicker decision and potentially accept a higher price.

**Important:** It's essential to strike a balance. While aiming high is good, an excessively inflated price might discourage Bob entirely."
