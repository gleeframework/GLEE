"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
