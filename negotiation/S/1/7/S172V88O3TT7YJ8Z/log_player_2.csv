Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer.

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get the price down further by making another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and I'm now only $100,000 away from my desired price point. It's not ideal, but it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer minimizes my risk of further negotiations stalling or Alice walking away completely."
