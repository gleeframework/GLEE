"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  To bridge the gap, how about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. I think that's a fair price for the product.",9750.0,Bob,4,
