Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to the right buyer. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, knowing Bob might counteroffer. 
* **Flexibility:**  I can still walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly below what I consider the product to be worth. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and I can try to meet him halfway. 
* **John is a backup option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  To bridge the gap, how about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Reinforce value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, subtly implying that $10,500 is still a good deal.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I'm not giving in completely, leaving room to potentially negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $9,750 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not a price I'm entirely happy with. I'm not sure if further negotiation will get me much closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is much better:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly more than Bob's current offer. 
* **Time is valuable:**  I'm not sure how much longer I want to negotiate with Bob, and I want to secure a deal quickly.

This decision maximizes my potential profit and minimizes the risk of a lower sale price."
