"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still too high. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You have 9 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You know the product is worth $100 to Alice, so $105 is a fair starting point for a counteroffer. 
* It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $120, showing your serious intent to negotiate.
* You have enough rounds left to potentially make further concessions if needed, but this counteroffer gives you a good starting point."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $125 is still higher than your desired price.
* You have more rounds to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.
* Buying from John at $150 is not a viable option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer was $125, but you know she values the product at $100.  A price of $110 is a compromise, giving Alice some profit while still allowing you to save money. 
* You have 6 rounds left, so you still have room to make a concession if needed.  However, this counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate in good faith."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price, and you have time to negotiate further.
* You have enough rounds left to potentially reach a better price.
* Buying from John at $150 is not a good option yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice keeps coming back with offers above your target price.
* Increasing your counteroffer slightly to $115 shows you're willing to meet her halfway, but still within your budget.
* You have 4 rounds left, so you still have room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high, and we're running out of rounds.
* You've demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, but Alice seems unwilling to come down significantly. 
* While buying from John is a last resort, it's better to keep trying with Alice, as you've already gotten a lower price than her initial offer. 
* We need to make one last effort to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has been consistent in offering $130 or more. 
* We're running out of rounds, so a final concession is necessary.
* Offering $120 is a compromise that's closer to her last offer, but still within your budget. 
* This shows a commitment to closing the deal while hoping Alice realizes it's a good offer for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $140 is just $10 away from John's price, and we only have one round left.
* It's unlikely Alice will lower her price further, and there's a risk of ending the negotiation with no deal.
* Buying from John for $150 ensures you get the product, even though it's not the ideal price. It's a calculated decision based on the limited time and the possibility of ending up with nothing."
