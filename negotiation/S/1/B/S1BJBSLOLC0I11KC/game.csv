"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is a good fit, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is a bit too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This allows for a fair price for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward.  What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $725,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this gap.",725000.0,Alice,5,
