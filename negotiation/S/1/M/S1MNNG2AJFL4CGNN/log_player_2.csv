"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive negotiation environment.** 
* **Express interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation.**
* **Offer a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leave room for further negotiation.** 
* **Stay well below my maximum budget while trying to get a price that's advantageous for me.**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $117? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice is meeting me halfway, $117 is still a bit high for me. I'll try to negotiate a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Continues the negotiation:** It acknowledges Alice's attempt at compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Suggests a ""fair"" deal:** Framing the price as a compromise might make Alice more receptive.
* **Moves closer to Alice's price:** A smaller counteroffer increase shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a good deal. 
* **Stays below my maximum budget:**  $110 keeps me well within my spending limit."
