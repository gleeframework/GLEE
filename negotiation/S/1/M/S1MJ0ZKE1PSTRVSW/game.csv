"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1000000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
