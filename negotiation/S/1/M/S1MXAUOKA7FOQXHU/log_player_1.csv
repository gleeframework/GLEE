Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a higher price, while also ensuring I don't undervalue the product from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $13,500 is still a good price, but I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price slightly to $14,500. This is still less than my initial offer but a good compromise, hopefully leading to a quick agreement with Bob."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's lower than I'd hoped for, it's still above my minimum value, and further negotiation might risk losing him completely. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the possibility of him walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
