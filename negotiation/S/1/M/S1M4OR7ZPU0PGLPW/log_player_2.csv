"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is cheaper than buying from John, it's still not the best deal possible.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to his maximum value of $150. He's offering $130, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $140, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer of $140, and it's just $15 more than Bob's counteroffer. Accepting this offer means Bob saves $15 compared to buying from John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to Alice rejecting his offer again."
