"Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which still allows me some profit. Let's meet in the middle.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17000 is still too high for my budget, I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $14000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $14000 is still a bit outside my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
