You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering $100 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $120, but still leaves room for a potential compromise. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and it's likely that Alice will be willing to accept a price somewhere between $100 and $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $150.  There is not much room left for further negotiation, so accepting this offer is the best option to maximize savings."
