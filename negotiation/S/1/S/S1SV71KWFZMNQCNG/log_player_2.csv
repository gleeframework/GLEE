# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that has been meticulously crafted and tailored to meet your specific needs. This product holds significant value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am prepared to offer it at a special price. I propose to sell the product to you for $800,000. This represents a substantial discount compared to its intrinsic value, aiming to ensure a fair transaction while maximizing my return on investment. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits the product offers, aligning closely with its value to you. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you require further details to make an informed decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
