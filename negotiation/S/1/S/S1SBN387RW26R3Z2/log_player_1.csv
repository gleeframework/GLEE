 Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, so I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as John's offer, so I'll accept it. This ensures I get the maximum possible value from the sale."
