"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I'm confident that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. How about we settle on $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise a bit more. My revised offer is $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",9500.0,Alice,5,
