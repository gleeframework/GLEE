(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer is within Bob's budget and  might encourage Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price.  There are still several rounds left, so there's time to try and reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  This offer is still within his budget and  demonstrates that he is serious about purchasing the product. The goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is now within Bob's budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial asking price. While Bob could continue negotiating, there is a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or even increasing her price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product while still saving a substantial amount of money compared to Alice's original asking price. There is also the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to purchase from John at a higher price."
