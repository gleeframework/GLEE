{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's above my minimum price ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** This conveys flexibility and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **""Fantastic product"":**  This is a vague positive statement to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about the product's value to him.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Sets a high starting point:** This gives me more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Shows flexibility:**  By being open to negotiation, I can potentially secure a better price.
* **Keeps Bob interested:** The positive description and open negotiation prompt him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll need to analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider making a counteroffer or ending the negotiation and selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept due to the potential of quick sale, it's crucial to hold my ground and try to negotiate a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so accepting $10,000 would be a loss.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob's initial rejection suggests he might be willing to pay more, but needs to be pushed.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'll try to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and a fair reflection of your budget constraints.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm offering $13,000, which is still above my minimum but lower than my initial price. 
* **Justifications:** I'm explaining the reasoning behind my counteroffer, highlighting the discount and acknowledging Bob's budget. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with an open question to encourage further discussion and potentially reach an agreement.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maintains my minimum:** $13,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, preventing a loss.
* **Shows compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my initial price.
* **Keeps negotiation alive:**  The open question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to assess whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose an offer of $12000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  Since I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, there's no further advantage to continuing the negotiation.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum price:**  Accepting $12,000 ensures I get my minimum value for the product.
* **No further gains:** There's no chance of getting a higher price from Bob, as he already offered my minimum.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting avoids further negotiation rounds and allows me to finalize the sale quickly.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and complete the sale, as this maximizes my earnings while minimizing further negotiation time."
