Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product is worth a significant amount, you're subtly anchoring its value in Bob's mind above the $100 he perceives it to be worth.
* **Time Pressure:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, you have John as a backup to guarantee your minimum price."
