"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $800000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this exceptional product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $850000.
