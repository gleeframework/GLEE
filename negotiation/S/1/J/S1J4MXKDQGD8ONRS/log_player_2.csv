"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $10000. I'm willing to let it go for $9500, which would still leave you with a significant gain.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While you value the product at $10,000, Alice is offering it for $9,500. This saves you $500 compared to buying from John.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You're paying less than your perceived value, which means you're making a profit on the purchase."
