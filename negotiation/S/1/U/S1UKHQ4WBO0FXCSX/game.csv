"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. Is this more to your liking?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but $1,150,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, but I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
