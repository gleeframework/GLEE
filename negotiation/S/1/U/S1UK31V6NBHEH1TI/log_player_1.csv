"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a high starting point, but I believe the product is worth it.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his value range and can adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his offer, and I hope it will be more appealing to him. It's still a good price for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial price, $13,000 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer.  The negotiation has been good so far, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."
