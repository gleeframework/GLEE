"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'll meet you at $12000, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'll throw in a free upgrade to the premium package, which is a $1000 value. That brings the total to $13000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it.",13000.0,Alice,7,
