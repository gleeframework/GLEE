{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential interest and opens a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I can potentially get more by counter-offering.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $107 is still below my desired price, it's closer to my minimum and a better outcome than selling to John for $100.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
