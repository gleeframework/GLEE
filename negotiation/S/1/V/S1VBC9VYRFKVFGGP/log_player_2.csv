**Explanation:**

We are getting closer to our target price with Alice's offer of $11,200. However, we are still within our budget and have a few rounds left to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, we can continue to push for a lower price. We have a good backup option with John, so we can afford to be patient and see if Alice will come down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}

**Explanation:**

We're increasing our offer slightly again, but still keeping it below Alice's last offer. This demonstrates we're willing to negotiate, but are also trying to get closer to our target price. 

We've reached the midpoint of the negotiation. By staying firm with our counteroffers and showing willingness to compromise, we're increasing the pressure on Alice to make a more favorable offer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is very close to my target price of $10,000. Although I still have some rounds left, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or an unfavorable outcome. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and allows me to avoid potentially losing out on the product if negotiations go south."
