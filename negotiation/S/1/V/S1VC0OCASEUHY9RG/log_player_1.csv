Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll receive."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing exclusivity and potential ROI, the high price is framed as a premium investment opportunity, not just a purchase. 
* **Fallback Option:** The guaranteed $1,000,000 from John provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still achieves her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's potential desire to secure the product before anyone else, potentially leading to a much higher profit than the guaranteed sale to John."
