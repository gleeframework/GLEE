"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  That would give us both a fair deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a fair offer considering the product's value. Let's make a deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate hard, and while I appreciate that,  $1,025,000 simply isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
