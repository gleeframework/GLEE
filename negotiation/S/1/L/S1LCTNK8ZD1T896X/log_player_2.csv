"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our product to you. We believe it could be a valuable asset to your endeavors, potentially worth $1,000,000 to you. Our initial offer for the product is $950,000. We're confident in its value and hope this proposal aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value of $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk in rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, we would like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000. This reflects our commitment to finding a mutually beneficial arrangement while maintaining the value we place on our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point of $1,000,000. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate and have a fallback option with John. By rejecting and counter-offering again, you can potentially secure a price closer to your desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than my target price.  How about $910,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued engagement in this discussion. After considering your most recent offer, we've decided to counter with $915,000 for the product. We believe this price respects both the value of our product and your budget constraints, aiming for a fair and satisfactory transaction for all parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $915,000 is now within your budget of $1,000,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or the negotiation will drag on.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price rather than potentially losing it altogether."
