Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:**  While I didn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, suggesting it has ""significant value"" subtly hints at its importance.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""what do you think"" invite Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential negotiation where I could still land above my minimum.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since I have John as a backup buyer at $8,000, I'm not risking losing any money by aiming higher with Bob."
