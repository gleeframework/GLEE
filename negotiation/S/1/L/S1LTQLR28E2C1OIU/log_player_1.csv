"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's a good starting point.  It gives Bob room to negotiate, while still leaving me substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still well above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round. I want to see if I can get him closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to try to push for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise and hopefully will lead to a successful deal."
