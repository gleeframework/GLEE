"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. I believe it's a valuable asset that could greatly benefit your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,800,000) to leave room for negotiation. It's important to establish a strong starting point, especially since I don't know Bob's valuation.
* **Adding Value:** I'm framing the offer as a benefit to Bob's business to pique his interest and potentially increase his perceived value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage dialogue and make it clear that I'm open to discussing the price.

**Important Note:** I will monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers or if he rejects the offer. I will also be mindful of the 10-round limit and the fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks interesting, but $1800000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, he expressed interest in the product and is willing to negotiate.  
* **Preserving Value:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind the 10-round limit and the $1,200,000 fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,500,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while recognizing your budgetary constraints."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob that I am willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profitability:** The $1,500,000 price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Appeal to Budget:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budgetary constraints, hoping to make the offer more appealing. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, the deal is closed. If he rejects, I will evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move to the fallback option with John. I'm still mindful of the remaining rounds and the need to secure the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1500000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go to $1200000.  This is a fair price for both of us, given my budget and your need to make a profit.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.  
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though I could sell to John for the same price, accepting Bob's offer leaves open the possibility of future business with him. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential deal breakdown, especially with the limited number of rounds remaining.

**Conclusion:**

This is a good outcome as it allows me to secure my minimum desired price while establishing a potential relationship with Bob for future transactions."
