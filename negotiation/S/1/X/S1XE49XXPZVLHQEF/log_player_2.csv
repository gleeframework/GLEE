"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still too high, and there's no reason to accept it on the first round.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible, and a $100 price is still a good deal for him. This offer is also a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This price is still fair for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle on $105? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible, but he also wants to close the deal.  A price of $105 is a good compromise for both parties, and it is a reasonable counteroffer after Alice's previous offer."
