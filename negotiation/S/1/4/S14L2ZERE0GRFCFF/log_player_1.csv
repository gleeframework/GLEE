{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500,  which still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
