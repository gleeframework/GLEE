# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.
