"Round 1

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $500,000 is a very good price, but there's potential to get it even lower. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's roughly 70% of Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still reasonable, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to take the risk of another round of counteroffers to try and get a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $375,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between my previous offer and her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still higher than my last counteroffer. I'm not ready to accept it yet and believe I can push for a lower price. I'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but this time only by a small amount to $400,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal but also that I'm willing to meet her halfway. I'm hoping this will be a price she's willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my counteroffer and I believe there is room for further negotiation. It's worth exploring one more round of counteroffers before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my offer again to $425,000. This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this is a price Alice will accept.  If she rejects, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but I'm running out of time and negotiation room. With only one round left, there's a high risk that Alice will reject my final counteroffer, and I'll be forced to pay her asking price. Buying from John at $1,500,000 guarantees I get the product, even though it's a much higher price. This ensures I don't lose out completely."
