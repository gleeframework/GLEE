"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value I think the product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $8,250 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet at $8,000? It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",8000.0,Alice,5,
