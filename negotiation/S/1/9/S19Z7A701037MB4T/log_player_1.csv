"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a bit more for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob has come up to $13,000, which is getting closer to my minimum value.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal. There's a chance I might be able to get a slightly higher price in the next round, but it's not worth risking a stalemate with Bob."
