Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 10250}"
