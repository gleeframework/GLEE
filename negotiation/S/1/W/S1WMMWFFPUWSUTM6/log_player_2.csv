"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $150. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it makes sense to accept the offer. There's no benefit in rejecting and buying from John at the same price."
