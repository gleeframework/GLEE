Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that gives us both room to negotiate.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm also ensuring that any potential deal is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Setting the Tone:** My message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a dialogue, rather than issuing a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum. 

I'm confident that this offer will encourage Bob to negotiate, while still leaving me in a strong position to potentially secure a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested and has shown willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation. It shows that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to walk away if necessary. 

I believe that by rejecting Bob's offer and countering with a higher price, I can increase the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying well above my minimum value. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  I'm framing this as a final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still making it clear that I have other options (John's offer) and am not desperate to sell at any price. 

This counteroffer provides a realistic compromise while maintaining my position and increasing the chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm getting close to considering John's offer, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Far Apart:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, we are still too far apart.  
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate, where we both end up with nothing. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is more than I'm likely to get from Bob at this point. 

While it's unfortunate not to close a deal with Bob, it's important to recognize when it's in my best interest to move on to a sure thing. John's offer provides a secure and profitable outcome."
