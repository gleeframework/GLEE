"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $8,250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still quite interested in the product, but $8,250 is a little bit out of my budget. How about we try for a price closer to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can offer you a slight discount, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
