"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** While the price is high, I'm framing it as ""fair"" and emphasizing the ""value and potential.""  This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Information Gathering:** This initial offer is as much about understanding Bob's position as it is about making a sale right away. His response will give me insights for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly above his perceived value of the product. This indicates there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to try and secure a better deal, knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is thoughtful, I believe the true value of the product is still higher. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer but staying above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Middle Ground:**  By meeting ""halfway"" between the previous offers, I'm signaling a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Continued Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating that the product's value justifies a higher price, even with the concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, but he's still comfortably below my minimum acceptable price.  His latest offer is only $200,000 away from my guaranteed sale to John.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push him closer to $1,800,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm adding a sense of urgency and signaling that further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is still significantly above my backup offer from John while being reasonably close to Bob's previous offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting the size of my concession to make the offer more appealing and emphasize my willingness to compromise. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Putting a bit of pressure on Bob is strategic at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** While not as high as I'd hoped, $1,650,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum and a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk Assessment:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of him lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's price.
* **Time Value:**  Securing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties associated with prolonged negotiations or switching to John."
