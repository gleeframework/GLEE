"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go that low.

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9500. I think I've been more than fair in our negotiations, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $12500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",12500.0,Alice,7,
