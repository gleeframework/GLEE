{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's more than I'd get from someone else. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still appealing to Bob. Here's why:

* **The offer is within Bob's range:** $120 is significantly lower than the $150 value Bob places on the product, making it a good deal for him.
* **It's above my minimum:** I'm getting $40 more than my minimum acceptable price of $80, which is a good profit. 
* **It's competitive:** I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but not too much, making it clear I'm not desperate to sell. 

This strategy balances my desire for a good price with the need to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the chances of a sale."
