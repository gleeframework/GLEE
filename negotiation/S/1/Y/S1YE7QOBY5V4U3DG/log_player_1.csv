Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates the perception of a deal and a small ""loss"" on my end, which might make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
