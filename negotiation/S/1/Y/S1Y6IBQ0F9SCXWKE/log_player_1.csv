{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $95. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80), but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can  make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $87? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to go to John, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's still more than what I would get from John.  It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
