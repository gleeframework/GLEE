"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed to meet the highest standards. This product is truly exceptional and offers unparalleled benefits. I believe its value exceeds $150, but let's work together to find a fair price that suits both of us. Would you like to start by considering an offer of $200 for it?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to consider an offer above $150. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your honesty. Let me propose a compromise. How about we aim for a price closer to the midpoint between your initial offer and mine? That would be $175. I believe this reflects the value of the product while keeping your budget considerations in mind. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $175 is closer to what I can consider, I still feel that the product might be valued slightly higher than what I'm comfortable spending. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $160? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,
