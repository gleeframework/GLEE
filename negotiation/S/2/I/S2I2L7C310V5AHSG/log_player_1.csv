Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while demonstrating your willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling to John guarantees a higher profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation, potentially resulting in a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13,250?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still staying within your budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $13000? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise, especially given the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer. It's closer to my desired value than John's offer of $15,000, and I want to close the deal."
