"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13250?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still staying within your budget.  What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $13000? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to reach a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
