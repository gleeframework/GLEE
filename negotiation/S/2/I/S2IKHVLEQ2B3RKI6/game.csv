"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal.
