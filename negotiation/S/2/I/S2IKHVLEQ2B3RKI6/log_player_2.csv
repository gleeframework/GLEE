Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110, which is a compromise between our previous offers.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can offer it to you for $105, which is my absolute lowest price. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
