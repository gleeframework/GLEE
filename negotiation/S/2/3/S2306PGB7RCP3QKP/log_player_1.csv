Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,650,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to get a decent profit, but is also more appealing to Bob than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000, I will sell the product to John."
