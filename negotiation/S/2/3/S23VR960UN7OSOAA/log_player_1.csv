Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $17,500 is higher than your minimum of $15,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $17,500 is below Bob's valuation of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate a price he finds acceptable.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A much higher offer might make Bob immediately reject, so it's best to start with a slightly higher price and see how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my max budget is $15000.  Would you be willing to work with me on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob's offer of $15,000 matches your minimum acceptable price, it's in your best interest to accept.  You've achieved your goal of earning at least $15,000 and you've successfully closed the deal.  There's no need to risk further negotiation or selling to John, who would offer the same price."
