Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I would like to propose a price of $1150000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,150,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 9 rounds left to negotiate and a fallback option with John, so I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. However, $1,150,000 is just too far below my minimum value for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I would like to propose a price of $1225000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,225,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and it's a good compromise considering we've both made concessions.  It's also closer to the value of the product for both of us, so it's a win-win situation."
