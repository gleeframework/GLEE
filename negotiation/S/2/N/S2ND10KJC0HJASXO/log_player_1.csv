Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum sale price:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, setting your absolute floor.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so any offer above this has the potential to be profitable for him. 
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a strong offer of $1,300,000 significantly increases your potential profit margin compared to accepting John's offer.
* **Creating urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the deal seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes limited negotiation rounds. If there's room for back and forth, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower to allow for counter-offers.
*  Gauge Bob's interest level through his response. This will help inform your approach in potential further negotiations."
