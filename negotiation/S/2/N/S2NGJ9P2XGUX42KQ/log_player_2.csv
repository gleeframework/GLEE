"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is only slightly below my maximum price. I have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal. It's worth risking a counteroffer to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's roughly halfway between Alice's asking price and my ideal price. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,125?  That would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer slightly below her current price to see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we land on $10,900? I think that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10900
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm nudging the price down slightly from Alice's last offer. This shows I'm willing to be flexible but still want a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. How about we settle on $11,000?  That's a good middle ground, and I think it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down considerably, and this offer is a good compromise. It saves me $1,000 from my maximum budget and is only $1,000 over Alice's valuation. It's unlikely I'll secure a significantly better deal from Alice at this point, and further negotiation might risk the deal."
