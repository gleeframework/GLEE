"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the significant value it holds, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my maximum budget than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer significantly lower, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down considerably in price, and $1,250,000 is within my budget. While it's slightly more than John's offer, securing the product now is worth the small premium.  Further haggling might irritate Alice and jeopardize the deal."
