"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
