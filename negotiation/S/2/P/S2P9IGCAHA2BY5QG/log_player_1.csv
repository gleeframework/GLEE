"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately a deal-breaker. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:**  While I'm aiming for the highest possible price, I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit.  If negotiations stall, I'll be ready to move on to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would you consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $125 is better than his initial $100 valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal within the remaining rounds.
* **John is a safety net:**  The option to sell to John provides a guaranteed $150, which gives me leverage to hold out for a more favorable price from Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $140? I'm willing to work with you to reach a fair price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by suggesting a middle ground. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and cooperative tone to keep the negotiation constructive.
* **Still above my minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price, which gives me some room to maneuver if Bob counteroffers again.

By offering a compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the deal while also ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $130 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **More room for negotiation:** There are still 6 rounds left. I'm confident I can push for a higher price within the remaining rounds.
* **John is a strong backup:**  The option to sell to John provides a guaranteed $150, giving me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $130 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's try $135.  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** I'm only increasing the price by $5, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still sticking to my bottom line.
* **Focus on compromise:**  I reiterate my willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation positive and open.

By offering a slight increase and emphasizing compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal. However, I'm still prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, with John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some research and found that the market value of this product is around $130. I believe $128 would be a fair price considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has come up slightly, $128 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the rounds, and I need to be more aggressive in securing a better price.
* **John is still a reliable option:** Selling to John guarantees $150, which is still a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I need to push for a higher offer to avoid settling for a price that's too low, especially with time running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you've done your research, but $128 is still far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $132. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:** I'm raising my offer slightly from $130 to $132, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of the offer, highlighting the product's value and the compromise I'm making.
* **Urgency:** I subtly introduce a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's make this happen!"". This encourages Bob to accept before the remaining rounds expire.

By being firm but flexible, and highlighting the potential for both of us to be satisfied, I hope to motivate Bob to accept the offer in this round.  I'm still prepared to negotiate further if needed, but the clock is ticking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the market value and our previous offers, I believe $129 would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer slightly, $129 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited time:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, with only two rounds left. This makes it even more crucial to secure a better price.
* **John is a safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees $150, which is still a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer.

I need to make one more counteroffer to try and convince Bob to agree to a price closer to my minimum.  However, if Bob rejects my next offer, I'll sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a solution that works. Given our previous discussions and the product's value, I'm willing to go down to $131.  I'm hoping this final offer encourages you to accept the deal.  If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 131}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final counteroffer, and it's the closest I'm willing to go to Bob's valuation.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that's fair to both parties.
* **Urgency:** The message conveys a sense of finality and urgency, encouraging Bob to accept the deal.  I emphasize that I'm ready to move on if we can't agree.
* **Fairness:** I reiterate that the offer is fair considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.

This final offer attempts to strike a balance between securing a better price and avoiding the risk of losing the deal altogether.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to John for the guaranteed $150 profit."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiations. 
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $129 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

Even though Bob is persistent, I've made multiple compromises, and I'm confident that I've squeezed as much value as possible from this negotiation. It's time to secure the guaranteed profit with John."
