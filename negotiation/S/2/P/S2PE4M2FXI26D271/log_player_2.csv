"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $150 is over your budget, and you can get the same product from John for $120. It's always a good idea to try to negotiate a better price before resorting to the backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

You are aiming for a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $100 is a good starting point, as it's below your budget and might tempt Alice to make a deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$140 is still above your budget. You're willing to go up to $120, so you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You're getting closer to your budget. A counteroffer of $110 demonstrates your seriousness in buying the product while still leaving room for Alice to make a concession."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

``` 

You're very close to your budget! Even though $125 is a bit more than you're willing to spend,  you can still try to get closer to your desired price with a final counteroffer."
