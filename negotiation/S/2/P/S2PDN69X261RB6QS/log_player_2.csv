Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer to you - $720,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has drawn a firm line.  While we could try to haggle further, the potential savings are small and there's a risk Alice walks away. $720,000 is a reasonable price considering our $1,500,000 upper limit."
