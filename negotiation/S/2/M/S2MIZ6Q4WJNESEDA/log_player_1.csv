Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His response will guide my next move.
* **John as Backup:**  Having a guaranteed buyer in John provides me leverage. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $900,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000. This indicates he's willing to negotiate and potentially pay more.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a significant gap between his offer and both my minimum ($1,000,000) and my initial ask ($1,300,000). Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open.
* **John as Leverage:** I'm not in a rush. Having John as a backup buyer allows me to confidently negotiate for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but the value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low. Would you consider $1,150,000? This reflects my desire to find a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've reduced my price by $150,000, signaling flexibility. However, I'm staying above my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere in the middle of the remaining price difference. It shows a willingness to compromise while still valuing the product appropriately.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This offer will reveal how much Bob is truly willing to pay. His response will determine if we can reach an agreement or if I need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 shows he's not moving significantly towards my minimum of $1,000,000. Further haggling is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's standing offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. There's no risk involved, and it prevents further time wasted on uncertain negotiations.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a cost, both in terms of time and potential lost opportunities. Accepting John's offer ensures a clean and profitable outcome."
