"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $140. It's a fair price considering its unique value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $140 is a bit more reasonable than your initial offer, I still feel there might be room for further discussion. Could we aim for $135? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
