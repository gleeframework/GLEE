Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing John is ready to pay that. This sets a strong baseline and puts the pressure on Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is tempting, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial price, but still leaves me with a profit. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to come up a bit to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and negotiating further risks wasting valuable time. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
