# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than the price you'd pay for the same product from John ($1,500,000).  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
