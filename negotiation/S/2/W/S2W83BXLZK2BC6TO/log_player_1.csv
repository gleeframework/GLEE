Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, getting even a little more from Bob is preferable. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a sense of urgency and makes it more appealing to Bob. He gets a $500 discount compared to its actual worth to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this price point leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's really eager, potentially netting you even more."
