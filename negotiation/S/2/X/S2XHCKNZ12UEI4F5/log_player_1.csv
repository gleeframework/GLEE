I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is the price I would get from John, so I'm not losing any money if Bob rejects the offer.  While this may seem like a risky move, it's the best strategy to maximize my potential earnings. 

Here's why:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:**  If Bob accepts, I earn the full $15,000. 
* **Guaranteed Minimum:** If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $15,000 from John.

By offering the highest possible price, I give Bob the chance to make a deal that's beneficial to him, while also guaranteeing that I get my desired value for the product."
