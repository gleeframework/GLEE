"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no benefit to accepting it.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or switch to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential compromise. It's a reasonable starting point that acknowledges Alice's value for the product while also reflecting your own budget constraint."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is within my budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product for a price I'm comfortable with, saving me $500 compared to buying from John. While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
