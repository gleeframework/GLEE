"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think you'll really love it, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could consider going up to $7,000.  Do you think that would be workable?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $7,000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've got to be honest, $10,000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's absolutely my limit. I understand if that doesn't work for you, but I'm hoping we can make a deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $7,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
