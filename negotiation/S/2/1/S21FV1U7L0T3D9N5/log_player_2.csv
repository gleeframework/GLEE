"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think you'll really love it, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer than your target. This leaves room for you to gradually increase your offer while gauging Alice's flexibility.
* **Significant Difference:**  The initial offer is so far above your budget that a small counteroffer wouldn't be effective. A larger difference might encourage Alice to reconsider her pricing. 
* **Politeness:** Even though the initial offer was high, remaining polite keeps the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $12,000 is better than $18,000, it's still significantly more than your $8,000 limit and even further from your initial offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move her price suggests there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your range."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could consider going up to $7,000.  Do you think that would be workable?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** Showing willingness to increase your offer, even if it's a smaller increment, demonstrates that you're engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $7,000, you're aiming for a price that's closer to your target while still leaving some room for potential compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how much further Alice is willing to lower her price and if a deal within your budget is realistic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to go up to $7,000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nearing the Limit:** $10,000 is getting close to your $8,000 limit, but it's still above your budget.
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:**  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but she's holding firm to a price above your comfort zone. Rejecting this offer might encourage her to make one final concession. 
* **John is an Option:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $8,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I've got to be honest, $10,000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's absolutely my limit. I understand if that doesn't work for you, but I'm hoping we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer presents a compromise close to your maximum while still leaving a small margin for potential negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:** Your message is firm about your budget constraints, but it also expresses a desire to reach a deal.
* **Alternative Ready:** By this point, you've established that you're willing to walk away and buy from John if necessary. This gives your final offer more weight."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $7,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Far Apart:**  While Alice has come down considerably, $9,000 is still $1,000 over your budget.
* **Alice is Firm:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to budge much further from this final offer. 
* **John's Price is Better:**  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $8,000 from John. It makes more sense to save the extra money at this point."
