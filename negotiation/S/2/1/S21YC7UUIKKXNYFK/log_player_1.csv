Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, $1,600,000 is a good deal and it's more than what John is offering.  I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
