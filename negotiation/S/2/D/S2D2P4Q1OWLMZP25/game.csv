"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, the price you're asking is a little high for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $750,000? This would be a fair compromise, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $825,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $795,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
