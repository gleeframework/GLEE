Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $825,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $795,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Getting Close to Alice's Value:** Alice has explicitly stated her product's value is $800,000. Her offer of $795,000 is very close to this, signaling she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Significant Savings:** You're still saving $205,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk of Pushing Too Far:**  If you continue negotiating and push too hard, Alice might walk away, leaving you to buy from John at the higher price."
