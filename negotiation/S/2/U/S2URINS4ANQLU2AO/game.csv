"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  That's still a great price for you and a fair deal for me.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's go with $10900.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any more back and forth.  What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
