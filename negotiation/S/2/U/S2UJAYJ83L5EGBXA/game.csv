"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you at $125. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $135? I think that's a more reasonable price for this amazing product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $135, which would be $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think $130 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $140, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price for the product's value.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Can you reconsider?",135.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the original price I was willing to accept from John. I'm willing to meet you at $137.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I think I'll have to consider other options.",137.5,Alice,7,
