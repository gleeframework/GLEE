Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good compromise between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. 

* **For me:**  It's significantly better than the $10,000 I'd get from John. 
* **For Bob:** It's a great deal, as he values the product at $15,000 and can save $1,000. 

There's a high probability Bob will accept, as he stands to save a good amount. If he rejects, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer, so I have no risk in making this offer."
