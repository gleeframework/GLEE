Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, justifying the high price.
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
