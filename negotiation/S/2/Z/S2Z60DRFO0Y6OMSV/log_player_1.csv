Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, but I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is interested at all before lowering my price.  If he's not, I'll need to consider my other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price ($150) and even below the value of the product to him ($120).  I'm not going to accept that. I'll try to get a better offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground.  I'm dropping my price slightly, but I'm still getting a good deal that's closer to my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $130 is a fair price for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $125 is below my initial goal, it's still above the product's value to Bob and it's very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's also a good strategy to avoid going back and forth with Bob for too long. There's a chance he could reject my next counteroffer or try to negotiate further down.  I'd rather close the deal now and avoid the risk of losing the sale completely."
