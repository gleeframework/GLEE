"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That's a fair price for both of us.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $97 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I'll sell the product to you for $102. This is a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",102.0,Alice,5,
