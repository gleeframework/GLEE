"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",780000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $780,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $820,000 for this product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds.  Let me know if you're interested.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $820,000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price based on the value I see in it.  If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
