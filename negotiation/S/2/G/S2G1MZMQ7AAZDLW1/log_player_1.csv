"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies that I'm open to discussion and willing to compromise. 

This approach aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob's message indicates a willingness to negotiate and that he values the product.  
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially bridging the gap and reaching a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is an Option:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still leaves some room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $16,000 is still a good price for me, considering my minimum is $15,000. It also ensures I won't settle for a price significantly lower than my perceived value.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** By offering a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation open and give Bob the opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm hoping he will meet me halfway, or at least come closer to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob's offer is a positive sign that we are moving closer to a deal. He's demonstrating a desire to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to make a counteroffer. I have a few more rounds to explore a more favorable deal.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**   Selling to John for $15,000 is always a viable option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making my final offer, indicating my willingness to accept a price that's at my minimum. This puts the ball in Bob's court.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, highlighting the fact that $15,000 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Close the Deal:**  My message is direct and implies a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision. 

At this point, I'm hoping Bob will accept my offer. If he rejects, I'll consider selling to John, as I'm not willing to go lower."
