"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is the lowest I can go while still feeling it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $8,750 again, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8750.0,Bob,6,
