{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $9,500, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've kept the message concise and positive, highlighting the value of the product and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I create an opportunity for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer or walk away and sell to John, ensuring I get at least my minimum desired price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that's below my minimum. I'll proceed to the next round and counter-offer Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've countered with $9,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I've emphasized my willingness to negotiate but also maintained my position that $8,500 is too low.  I've framed the $9,000 offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob, encouraging him to accept. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping to close the gap without sacrificing too much. 
* My message is still friendly but firm, ensuring I don't appear desperate. 
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll be ready to either make another counteroffer or sell to John for $10,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome. I'm not willing to settle for less than $9,000 at this point. I'll proceed to the next round and make another counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is the lowest I can go while still feeling it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to reach a mutually agreeable price by making one last concession.
