Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  While we could try to negotiate with Bob further, there's no guarantee of reaching a higher price. Accepting his offer or continuing negotiations risks getting stuck below our minimum acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees we receive the product's full value to us."
