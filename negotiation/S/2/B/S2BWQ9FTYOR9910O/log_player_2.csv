"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is a high-quality item worth more than $100 to you, and we believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to adjust our negotiation terms slightly. I would like to offer the product to you for $90. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum. You can continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further.  While buying from John is always an option, it's worth seeing if you can reach a deal with Alice at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little high for me. I'm really aiming to stay under $85. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. After careful consideration, I've decided to adjust my offer to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product to you for $88. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while ensuring you receive a good value for your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is within your budget and only slightly above your desired price of $85. It's a good deal considering your alternative is buying from John for $100.  Further negotiation may be possible, but it's risky as you could end up paying more or having to buy from John.  It's likely Alice is not going to lower the price much further, so accepting her offer is the best option at this point."
