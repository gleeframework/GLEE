Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,000. How about $7,500? Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my target price! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $7,750? It's still a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $7,500.  She's consistently met in the middle, but always keeps her price above yours.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially paying more than John's price."
