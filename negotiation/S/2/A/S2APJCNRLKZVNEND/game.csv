"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,000. How about $7,500? Is that something you'd be interested in?",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise. How about we split the difference again and settle on $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my target price! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $7,750? It's still a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you.",7750.0,Alice,7,
