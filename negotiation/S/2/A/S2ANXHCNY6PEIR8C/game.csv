"Alice, your offer is intriguing, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's more in line with my budget.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product.  This still reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $750000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,
