"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, you aim to anchor Bob's perception of its worth at a higher level.
* **Open to Discussion:**  While starting high, it's crucial to express willingness to negotiate. This keeps Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your openness to discussion. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still substantially lower than our target. We have plenty of room for negotiation and time to explore higher prices before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It demonstrates your interest in the product. However, given its unique features and potential return on investment, I'm aiming for a price closer to $2,100,000. Would you be open to considering a figure in that range?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate:** Recognizing Bob's counteroffer as a positive sign keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Hold Firm (For Now):**  We're stepping down from our initial offer but remaining firm above the $2 million mark. This signals that we're serious about a higher price point.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking if Bob would ""consider"" a figure in that range encourages him to stay engaged and propose a counteroffer. We want to see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered the product and its value. I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly negotiating and moving closer to the $2 million mark. While $1,950,000 is tempting, we are still in the early rounds and have room to push a little further before considering John's offer or accepting a price below our ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $2,025,000? This reflects the true worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 2025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  Praising Bob's negotiation skills helps maintain a positive tone and encourages him to continue engaging.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  We are moving closer to the midpoint between our previous offer and his. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price above $2 million. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing a specific number and framing it as a ""settlement,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've thought about it and decided to counter with $1,975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,975,000 is very close to our $2 million aspiration and significantly higher than his initial offer and perceived value of the product.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  After six rounds, both parties might be experiencing negotiation fatigue. Accepting now prevents potential stalemates or Bob lowering his offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the difference is likely to be marginal at this point. Accepting secures a very good deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
