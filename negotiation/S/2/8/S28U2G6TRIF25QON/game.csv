"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, given my current budget constraints.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. Your proposed price is reasonable, but to be completely transparent, I need to secure a bit more for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000? This allows me to achieve my minimum while still offering you a great deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
