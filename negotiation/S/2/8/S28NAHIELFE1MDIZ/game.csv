"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $8,500?  That's still a good price for you, considering the value of this product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $8,500 is still a little high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference again and settle at $8,125.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",8125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $7,900 and we call it a deal?",7900.0,Bob,6,
