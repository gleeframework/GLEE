Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000 (my value for the product).
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $12,000.
* **John's price:** $15,000.

I'm offering Bob the product at $14,000. This price is higher than his value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me a better chance of selling to Bob, which is ideal as it avoids the hassle of selling to John and still secures a decent profit."
