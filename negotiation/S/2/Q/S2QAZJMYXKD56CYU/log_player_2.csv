"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what you could buy it for from John ($1,200,000). Rejecting this offer opens the possibility for a counter-offer from Alice closer to her $800,000 valuation or allows you to purchase from John at a lower price."
