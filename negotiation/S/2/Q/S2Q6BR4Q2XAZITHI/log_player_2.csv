This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated the price down $112,500 from her initial offer.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more, and you risk Alice becoming less willing to compromise.
* **Alternative:** While John offers the product at $1,200,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you a considerable amount. 

Alice has shown a willingness to meet in the middle, and this offer represents a strong deal for you."
