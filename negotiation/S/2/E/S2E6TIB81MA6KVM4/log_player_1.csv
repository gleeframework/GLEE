"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) but still lower than the price John would pay ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Strong Opening:** I'm stating the value of the product and providing a justification for the price. This helps establish a starting point for the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting high, I create space for Bob to counteroffer, giving us a chance to find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth, which is key to convincing Bob it's a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine my next move based on the remaining rounds and his offer. I might accept his offer, make a counteroffer, or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. 
* **I have more rounds:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have ample opportunity to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better price. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price or at least match my minimum value with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. 
* **Strategy:**  I will consider the remaining rounds and Bob's willingness to negotiate when formulating my counteroffer. I might aim for a price closer to $1,000,000 or try to find a middle ground. 
* **Monitoring John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I acknowledge the value you place on the product, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to meet you halfway. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it also allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's continue this discussion."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a compromise, coming down from my initial $1,200,000 offer but still above Bob's current offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price point. This keeps the focus on the product's worth, not just the price.
* **Maintaining Minimum Value:** My counteroffer stays above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't make a financially disadvantageous deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I will carefully analyze Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I will use the remaining rounds and his counteroffer to formulate my next strategy.
* **Consider John's Offer:** I will continue to keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a backup option, especially if negotiations with Bob stall or if the remaining rounds become limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum Value:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  There is no significant wiggle room for further negotiation to get a higher price. 
* **Time Pressure:** With 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming more risky to hold out for a higher price.  I could potentially lose the deal altogether.

**Next Steps:**

* **Secure the Deal:** By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements. It's a good deal, and I've successfully negotiated a favorable outcome.
* **Evaluate Future Offers:**  I will continue to monitor John's offer of $1,000,000, but since Bob's offer is already at my minimum, I'm likely to stick with this deal."
