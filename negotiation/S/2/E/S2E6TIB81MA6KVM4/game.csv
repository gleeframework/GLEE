"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I acknowledge the value you place on the product, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to meet you halfway. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it also allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
