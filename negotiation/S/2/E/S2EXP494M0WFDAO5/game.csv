"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $11,750 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say $10,500? That feels like a fairer deal to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to make this work. However, I need the price to be closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? This is a significant reduction on my end.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer a bit more to show I'm serious. Would you be willing to settle at $10,750?  That's a big jump from my previous offer, and I think it's a really fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,6,
