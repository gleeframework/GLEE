Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $115. This is a fair price that is above my minimum threshold and leaves some room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, given the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm countering with $110.  This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that will still be attractive to Bob while getting me closer to my desired profit."
