Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I appreciate your perspective on the value, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price.  Would you consider $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise to ensure both our interests are met."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but we are still far from our minimum acceptable price. We are willing to negotiate, but we need to show that we are firm on the value of the product. We'll counter-offer, aiming to guide the negotiation closer to our desired outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is not moving significantly closer to our $1,000,000 minimum. We've given him multiple opportunities to meet us closer to our asking price. At this point, it's more strategic to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
