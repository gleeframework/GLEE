"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired price range. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has a few things to consider here:

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and a decent compromise.
* **John's Price:**  John's price of $15,000 is higher. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers.

Considering all factors, accepting Alice's offer at $13,000 is the most logical choice. It allows Bob to save $2,000 compared to buying from John, while still getting the product within his desired range."
