"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $850,000? I think that's a fair price that allows us both to benefit.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about $950,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still allows you a good return on your investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your return, and I'm also trying to get a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
