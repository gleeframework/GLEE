"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  What do you say to a price of $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $100. Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a lower price than Bob would pay John, he can still get it for a lower price by rejecting the offer.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can then purchase the product from John for $100, which is still within his budget."
