"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still quite low considering the true value of this product and its potential to benefit your business. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can we agree on that price?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be honest with you - $1,075,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,100,000.  This offer represents a significant discount on the true value of this product, and I believe it's more than fair.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is the price I mentioned earlier. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Can we agree on this price?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
