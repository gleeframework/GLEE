,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for your product. This is a fair price, considering it's below your asking price and within my range.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still gives you a significant discount, and it's much closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from your original offer, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your need to make a profit while remaining within my price range. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
