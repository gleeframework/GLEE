Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Counteroffers:** A $100,000 difference allows for a few rounds of counteroffers without me having to drop below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm aware that John will pay $1,500,000, so I'm not overly eager to make a huge concession to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will make a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap and hopefully reach an agreement closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This represents a substantial discount for you, and it allows me to still make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above his initial price.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the discount Bob is getting, making the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so it remains a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and potentially lead to a stalemate or a lower offer from Bob.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely. 

While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to sell the product and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
