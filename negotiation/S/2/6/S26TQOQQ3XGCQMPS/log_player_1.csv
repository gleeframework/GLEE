Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, which might be more appealing to him than a firm offer.
* **Secure a Deal:**  While Alice has John as a backup, it's always better to secure a deal quickly rather than relying on a fallback option."
