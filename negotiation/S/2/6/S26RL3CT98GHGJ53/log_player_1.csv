Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Please let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's inclined, further maximizing our profit. 
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a strong backup offer from John at $1,000,000, ensuring we won't be left empty-handed. This knowledge empowers our negotiation position. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a premium price and ensuring we don't undervalue the product if negotiations fail."
