"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* This allows me to explore the possibility of getting closer to Bob's perceived value while still securing a profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. 
* However,  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
*  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* There's still room for negotiation, and I believe a higher price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground. 
* This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* If Bob accepts, I'll secure a better price than his initial offer.
* If he rejects, I can reassess and adjust my strategy based on his subsequent counteroffer."
