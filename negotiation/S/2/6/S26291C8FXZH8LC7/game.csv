"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my current needs, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly exceptional and it represents a significant investment for me as well. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this revised offer bridges the gap and is a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $1,700,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000 for the product, a price that allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
