Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and it's worth the same to you (with John as a backup buyer), starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification for Price:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and requesting a quick decision might encourage Bob to accept before considering negotiation.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation.  A more nuanced approach might involve multiple rounds with offers and counter-offers."
