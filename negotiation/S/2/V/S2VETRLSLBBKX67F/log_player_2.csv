"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $19,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save $7,000."
