"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $100. This is a good starting point, but Bob can likely do better.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has 10 rounds and the option to counteroffer. This gives him leverage to potentially negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer:**  $150 is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay. This is a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals that he's interested but willing to negotiate. He can now use the counteroffer process to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** $75 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. However, it's not so low as to seem unreasonable. 
* **Focus on value:** Bob emphasizes his interest in the product while stating his price limit. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  A $75 counteroffer still leaves space for a few rounds of back and forth, giving Alice an opportunity to make a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That's still a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer:** $85 is a compromise, but still above Bob's desired price point. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Bob still has 7 rounds left, allowing for additional counteroffers. 
* **John's offer:**  $150 remains a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail.

**Strategy:**  Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his target of $75.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives Bob leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $80. It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental offer:**  Bob moves closer to Alice's offer but still keeps his desired price in mind.  $80 is a small compromise but signals a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message emphasizes a fair price for both, creating a sense of shared interest and encouraging a deal.
* **Continuing negotiation:** Bob leaves space for further negotiation while demonstrating his commitment to finding a solution."
