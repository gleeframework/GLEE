"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $80. It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement.",80.0,Bob,4,
