Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  It's a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a good value. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to sell for more, $10,000 is a good deal for me considering John is only offering $8,000. It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
