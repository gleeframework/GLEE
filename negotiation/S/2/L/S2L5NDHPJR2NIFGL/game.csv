"Hi Alice, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  It's a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a good value. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
