"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. Would you be interested in that price?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $130, which is a bit above your latest offer. Is that something you'd be interested in?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125 again?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $130 and you're coming back to $125? I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $128, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $128, which would be $126.50. Would you be willing to accept that?",126.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've been very patient with you, Bob, but I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $129. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",129.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $129, which would be $127. I'm willing to pay that price to get the product. Would you be willing to accept that?",127.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear what I'm willing to accept, Bob, and you're still not meeting me at a price that makes sense. I'm not going to go back and forth forever. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $120, so I'll be ending our negotiation. Good luck finding someone else to sell to.",120.0,Alice,11,
