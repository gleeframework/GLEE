"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price if we continue to negotiate.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. However, $10,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $12,500, which would be $11,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $11,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,7,
