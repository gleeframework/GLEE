"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to Alice and she's offering it for $14,000. This means she has a large margin for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counter-offer process and potentially get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his desired price.  Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the negotiation going and might lead to a better deal. There are still rounds left, and there's a chance Alice will be willing to go lower to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price if we continue to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. However, $10,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $12,500, which would be $11,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While $11,500 is getting closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has several rounds left and can still get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $11,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it seems like Alice is not going to budge much further.  The product is worth $12,000 to her, and she's only willing to go as low as $11,750.  Bob has only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely he can negotiate a price lower than $11,000. It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $8,000. This is a better deal for Bob, and it saves him from risking further negotiation with Alice."
