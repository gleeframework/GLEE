{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a deal that is closer to my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
