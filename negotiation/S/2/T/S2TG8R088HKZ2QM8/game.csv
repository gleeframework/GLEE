"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $9,000?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $10,200? That's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $10,400? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think!",10400.0,Alice,5,
