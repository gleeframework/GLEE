"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm prepared to sell it for $1,400,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,250,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still represents a substantial value for you, and it's closer to my desired range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,250,000, which would be $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a little away from where I need to be.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get a fantastic product at a great price while also ensuring I can move forward with this transaction. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'll meet you at $1,320,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
