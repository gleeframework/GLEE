"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately way too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $110 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $70?  That's a fair price closer to the middle.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let's close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $80? That's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
