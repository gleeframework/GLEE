"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I appreciate your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 represents the high-end value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $16,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting closer to my budget.",16500.0,Bob,4,
