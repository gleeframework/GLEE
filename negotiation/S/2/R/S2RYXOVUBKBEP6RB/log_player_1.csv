"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that signals the value I place on the product. It also gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm holding out for more. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm showing flexibility while also demonstrating that I believe the product is worth a premium price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $820,000 is finally above my minimum of $800,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and securing the sale rather than risking a lower offer or having to sell to John for the same price."
