"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me at this point. Given your stated value for the product, I'd like to offer $1,100,000 as a starting point for our negotiations. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. How about we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part and leaves room for us to close this deal fairly.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Given our back-and-forth, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
