"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  Could you consider $13,000? It's a fairer reflection of the product's worth.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $13,000 is still too high. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,500? It's a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",11500.0,Bob,4,
