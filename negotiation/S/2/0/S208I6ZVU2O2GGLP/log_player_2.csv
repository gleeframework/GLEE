"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a game-changer, and I'm confident it's worth significantly more to you in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($1,300,000 vs $800,000).  As Bob, your goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially secure a much better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,300,000 is too high. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** This counteroffer represents a 23% reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about negotiating a lower price.
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,000,000 is still a substantial profit for Alice considering her $800,000 valuation. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  The message highlights the potential benefit to both parties, making the offer more appealing and fostering a collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the significant potential this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $1,150,000. This reflects my commitment to a mutually beneficial deal while ensuring the product's true value is recognized. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a step closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit high. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and with 7 rounds remaining, there's potential to secure a price even lower. By rejecting, Bob maintains the leverage and can potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."

Round 4

This price reflects the product's potential while ensuring a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
