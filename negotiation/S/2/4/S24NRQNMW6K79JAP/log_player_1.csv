"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $125. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's still a great price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $118? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $118 is only $2 away from my last counteroffer of $120.  With only 6 rounds left, it's likely the negotiation will continue to go back and forth.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
