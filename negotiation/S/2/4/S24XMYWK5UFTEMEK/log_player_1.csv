Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This offer stands for a limited time as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a premium over his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob values the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the potential to exceed his initial $800,000 valuation. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited time"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
