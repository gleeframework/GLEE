Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $125 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** $125 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, so he has room to negotiate without feeling like he's overpaying.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price allows for both you and Bob to potentially move a bit to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $100. You can do better!  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, his offer of $102.50 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $100 and you are guaranteed a sale. Selling to John will only net you $100. It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a slightly higher price."
