Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a competitive price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has made it clear that $10,000 is his absolute maximum.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely we'll be able to get a better price from him. Selling to John for $10,000 ensures a guaranteed sale at our minimum acceptable price."
