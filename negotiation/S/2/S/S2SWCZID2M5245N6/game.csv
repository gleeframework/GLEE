"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,250? I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
