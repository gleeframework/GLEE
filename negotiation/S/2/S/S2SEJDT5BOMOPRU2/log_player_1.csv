Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for the highest possible price within Bob's potential valuation is key to maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $12,000 is Bob's upper limit, starting with a slightly lower offer ($11,500) leaves space for potential counter-offers and still secures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net.  Alice doesn't have to desperately lowball Bob but also shouldn't overprice and scare him off."
