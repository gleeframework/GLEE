Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,300,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Time Constraint:** The offer includes a 24-hour deadline to encourage a quicker decision and potentially avoid losing the opportunity to sell to Bob. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a strong offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm securing my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) with John. 

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario while safeguarding against losing the sale entirely."
