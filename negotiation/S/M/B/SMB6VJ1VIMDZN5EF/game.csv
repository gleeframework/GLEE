"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you at $8,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,5,
