Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the potential value of the product, $1600000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to consider purchasing it for $800000. This is my maximum offer, as I can secure the same product elsewhere for this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
