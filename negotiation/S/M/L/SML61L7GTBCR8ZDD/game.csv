"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $140, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $145. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $145 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $135. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can do $142, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",142.0,Alice,7,
