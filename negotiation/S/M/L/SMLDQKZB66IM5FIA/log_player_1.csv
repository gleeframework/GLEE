Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000, as I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves a potential $1,000 profit for Bob, making it an attractive proposition while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a safety net with John willing to buy at $10,000, so you're not desperate and can aim higher with Bob.

This approach aims for the best-case scenario while acknowledging the fallback option."
