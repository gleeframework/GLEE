Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but my last offer was a significant concession and reflects the true value of this product. To be transparent, I have other interested buyers.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,125,000?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing resistance to going below $1,100,000. She's also introducing pressure by mentioning other buyers. While she might still go a bit lower, it's unlikely she'll reach Bob's $1,000,000 limit. It's at this point that the risk of continuing negotiations outweighs the potential savings. Bob has a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000, which meets his needs."
