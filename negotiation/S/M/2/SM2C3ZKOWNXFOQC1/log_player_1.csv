{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm confident that John's offer of $120 is a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $130. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price of $125. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for a profitable deal. I believe this is a fair compromise and might be enough to convince Bob."
