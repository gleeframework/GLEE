"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefit for Bob (""great deal"") to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm letting Bob know I'm open to negotiation, which could lead to a faster agreement. 

**Important Note:**  This is a high-risk strategy.  If Bob immediately rejects, I might lose him as a buyer.  However, it's a good starting point to see if I can push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome.  However,  I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can close the deal with Bob for a better price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $1,000,000 to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""fair compromise"" and ""great deal"" to highlight the benefits for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for a higher price. 
* **Avoiding the Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, but I'm not convinced Bob won't come up a bit higher. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial price. This will show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell the product for $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This counteroffer is directly in the middle of my last offer ($975,000) and Bob's offer ($925,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could encourage Bob to accept.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and make the offer more appealing.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially move towards an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, there's a high risk of failing to close a deal with Bob.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a sale at a price that is far better than what Bob is currently offering. 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if we could reach an agreement, I need to prioritize maximizing my profit, and selling to John offers the most secure and lucrative outcome at this point in the negotiation."
