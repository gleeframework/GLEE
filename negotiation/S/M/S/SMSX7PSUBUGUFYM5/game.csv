"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has great potential, but $1,200,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $700,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
