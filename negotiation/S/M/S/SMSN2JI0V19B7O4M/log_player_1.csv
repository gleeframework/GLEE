Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer aims for a good compromise:

* **It's above my minimum of $10,000:**  Ensuring I make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value of $12,000:**  Giving him a reason to accept.

By leaving room for negotiation, I can potentially reach a higher price while still giving Bob a sense of winning the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired profit margin.  I will counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $11,000 is the lowest I can go.  This still gives you a great deal, considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
