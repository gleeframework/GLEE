"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Is $16000 a number you'd be comfortable with?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close the deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $16000, so I'll offer you $15500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to pay $15000, and I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already made a compromise at $15500, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free warranty and a premium service package, which is a $1000 value. So, if you're willing to meet me at $15500, I'll make sure you get the best deal possible. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,
