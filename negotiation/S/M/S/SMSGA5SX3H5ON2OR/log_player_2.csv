"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm asking for $14,000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm happy to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  That's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $13,500, Bob is still getting a good deal, saving $1,500 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of pushing for a lower price, there's a risk Alice could walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
