Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $110 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 
I'm going to offer Bob $135. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering my minimum value of $150.  I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to negotiate and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might end up losing him as a buyer. I'm also running out of rounds and don't want to risk having to sell to John for $150."
