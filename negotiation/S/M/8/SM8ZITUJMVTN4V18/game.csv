"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
