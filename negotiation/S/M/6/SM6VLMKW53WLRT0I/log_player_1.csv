"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to move down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not eager to sell at that price right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price to $135. This is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for him to accept, but I'm still ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not quite ready to accept his offer.  I'll reject it and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round. I'm still holding out hope that I can get closer to my initial asking price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130.  This is a smaller adjustment than in the previous round, showing Bob that I'm getting serious about closing a deal. At this price, I'm still earning a decent profit while demonstrating flexibility. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider my options in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $128 is getting closer, I'm still not ready to accept it. I believe there's room for a small increase, and I want to see if I can push for it. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer in the next round. If he refuses, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $130.  This is a fair price considering my minimum and Bob's increasing offers.  If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting very close to the end of our negotiations, and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement. I've tried to be flexible, but it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. While it's not my preferred outcome, it's better than risking another round of negotiation and ending up with nothing."
