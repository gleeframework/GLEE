"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900000. I'm willing to pay $880000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value I'll get from it.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $890000 and $870000, which is $880000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider selling the product to someone else.",880000.0,Alice,7,
