"Hello Alice, thanks for your opening offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $16,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and the initial offer I made.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $16,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with. However, $13,500 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $15,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",15500.0,Alice,5,
