"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is the lowest he's willing to go. I need to decide if I want to accept his offer or sell to John.
