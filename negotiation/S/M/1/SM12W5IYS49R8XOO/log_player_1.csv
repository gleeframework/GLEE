{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $10,000 as my initial offer. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* **Message:** I've included a friendly and encouraging message to entice Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to start with a price that's high enough to give me a good profit but not so high that Bob immediately rejects it.
* I'm keeping John in mind as a fallback option, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Even though it's closer to his perceived value, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. 
* **Proceed to the Next Round:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, keeping John's offer in mind.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm using John as a safety net, which allows me to be more firm with Bob during negotiations.
* I'll try to find a compromise price that's acceptable to both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $9,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing that it's still too low. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $9,500, which is a compromise between our initial positions.  The message highlights the potential benefit for Bob while remaining firm on my desired price.
* **Price:** $9,500 is a significant step closer to my desired price while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and reaching an agreement with Bob.
* By acknowledging his offer and proposing a counteroffer, I'm trying to maintain a positive and productive negotiation.
* I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,500. How about $8,750? I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:** While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my expectations, especially considering I have a guaranteed alternative with John.
* **Proceed to the Next Round:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm confident that I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer again, trying to find a compromise that's more favorable to me.

**Strategy:**

* I'm using John's offer as a safety net, which allows me to be firm in my negotiations.
*  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low, and that I'm committed to getting a better deal.
*  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John if necessary."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8,750 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again*, but this time between $8,750 and my last offer of $9,500. How about $9,125? This feels like a fair price for both of us to consider. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's compromise while emphasizing that his offer is still too low. I propose another compromise, this time meeting him halfway between our last two offers.  I also use language like ""fair price"" to emphasize the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Price:**  $9,125 is a compromise price that's closer to my desired range, but still lower than my previous counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but have a firm lower limit.
* I'm using a ""meet-in-the-middle"" approach to encourage Bob to compromise.
*  I'm keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John, which gives me more leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $9,125.  While it's still below my ideal price of $12,000, it's a good deal considering the risk of losing the sale to John. 
* **Minimize Risk:**  John's offer of $12,000 is tempting, but there's always a chance that the deal with John could fall through.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit.

**Strategy:**

* I'm using a risk-averse approach, prioritizing a guaranteed sale over potentially waiting for a higher price from John.
* By accepting Bob's offer, I'm ending the negotiation and securing a profit.
*  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's important to be practical and acknowledge that a deal is better than no deal."
