"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which would still be a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves significant profit for you. This is my final offer, let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
