Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $15,000, implying that it's based on the product's ""value"" provides a subtle justification for the higher price.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this offer will give Alice valuable information. If he accepts, great! If he negotiates, Alice knows he's interested. If he flat out refuses, she still has John as a backup."
