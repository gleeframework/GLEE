Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a great deal at $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay more, especially if he perceives a sense of urgency or exclusivity in the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $20,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate. If he counters, we can gauge his interest and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Plan:**  It's important to remember we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John.  This gives us leverage and means we don't need to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price accordingly."
