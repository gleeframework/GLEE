Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value to someone like you is undeniable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true significance and potential. "", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product's value is substantial to both you and Bob. This allows for a higher initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a significantly higher offer than John's allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it leaves room for negotiation. You can always lower the price, moving closer to your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Exclusivity:** By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" you subtly increase its perceived value and Bob's potential desire to acquire it.

**Important:** This is a bold opening strategy. It's crucial to be prepared for Bob's reaction and have a negotiation plan if he counters or outright rejects the initial offer."
