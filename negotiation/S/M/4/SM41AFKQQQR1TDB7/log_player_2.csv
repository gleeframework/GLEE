"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a great deal to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth, and it's a chance for you to secure a valuable asset. Consider this a win-win situation. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from what it's worth to her ($800,000). By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. 

If Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $1,000,000. You'll be paying a premium, but it's still within your budget."
