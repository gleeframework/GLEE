Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm offering $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I hope to find a middle ground with Bob that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $1,600,000 is still a good deal and significantly more than what I could get from John. It's important to be flexible in negotiations to secure a deal."
