"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you presenting your perspective and offer. While I understand your position, the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
