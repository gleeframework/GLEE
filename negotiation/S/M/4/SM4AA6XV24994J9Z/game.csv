"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you presenting your perspective and offer. While I understand your position, the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This shows my serious interest in purchasing the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  Let's make this simple: $1,600,000 and I'll agree to the deal today.  This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product with such potential.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal today.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
