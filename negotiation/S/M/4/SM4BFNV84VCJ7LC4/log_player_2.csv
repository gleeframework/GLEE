"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  You have room to negotiate and try to get a better price. There's no immediate urgency to buy from John, so it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? That's the highest I'm able to go at this time."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer significantly lowers the price, demonstrating your desire to make a deal. It's a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  It's important to provide a reason for your counteroffer to show you're negotiating in good faith."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding the value of this product. While $11,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit high. You can likely get a better deal if you continue to negotiate.  Remember, your goal is to save as much money as possible.  You've already shown your willingness to compromise, and Alice has responded in kind. It's worth seeing if you can get even closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for your flexibility.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  Would you be open to $12,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates continued negotiation while staying within your budget.  It's a small step down from Alice's offer, showing that you're trying to find a middle ground.  The message reinforces your desire to reach an agreement and emphasizes the fairness of your proposed price."
