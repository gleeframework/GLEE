"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? That's the highest I'm able to go at this time.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding the value of this product. While $11,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again for your flexibility.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  Would you be open to $12,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
