"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $13,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a valuable item at a discounted rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer.  There's room to bargain between $13,000 and our $15,000 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming for a price closer to Alice's value ($12,000) than ours. A lower starting point gives us more room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Positive:** We want to keep the negotiation friendly and collaborative, even while aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,500? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $12,500 is a solid price. It's closer to Alice's value, meaning she's likely made a reasonable concession. 
* **Saves Money:** It's significantly less than John's $15,000 offer. 
* **Avoids Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice pulling back or reaching an impasse, forcing us to take John's offer anyway. 

It's a good idea to take a win when we have one!"
