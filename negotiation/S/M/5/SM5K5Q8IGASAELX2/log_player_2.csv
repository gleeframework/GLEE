"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.
