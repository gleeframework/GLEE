"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this truly valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is well above my budget. I'm confident this product has value, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet halfway and settle on a price of $1,650,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $1,650,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. I've been giving this offer serious consideration, but I have another buyer who's prepared to offer me $1,500,000.  To make this work with you, I'd need to see a price closer to that figure. How about $1,475,000? This is my final offer.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear your other buyer's offer, but $1,475,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go to $1,450,000. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to move on to other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
