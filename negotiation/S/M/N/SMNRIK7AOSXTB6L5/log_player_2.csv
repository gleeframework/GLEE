Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $725000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise.  You're getting a decent discount from your maximum price and saving money compared to buying from John."
