"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.  This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings to your business.",10000.0,Alice,5,
