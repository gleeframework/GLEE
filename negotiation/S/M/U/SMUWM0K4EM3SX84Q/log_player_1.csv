"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a little more to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000 at this point.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $9,800 is getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for less than $10,000 yet. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but still higher than what Bob offered. I'm hoping that this will be enough to close the deal while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,900 is very close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for $10,000. With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful about risking a deal with John, but I'm still confident that I can get my desired price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
``` 

I'm making a final counteroffer of $10,200. It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to close the deal. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time and I need to secure a sale.  Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not confident I can get him to go higher in this limited time. To ensure I get at least my minimum, I will sell to John for $10,000."
