"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being willing to work with me on this. I appreciate you coming down in price. To be honest, $1,150,000 is a little bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we possibly do it for $1,050,000? That would really make this work for me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  This product truly is exceptional and at $1,050,000 it's a steal. However, I'm willing to compromise to finalize this deal. How about $1,100,000? This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
