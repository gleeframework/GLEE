"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a competitive price, and I can move it quickly. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price. You can then counteroffer Alice with a price closer to your desired $800,000, saving yourself money."

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, you can still get the product for $800,000 from John, making Alice's offer not worth it. Continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
