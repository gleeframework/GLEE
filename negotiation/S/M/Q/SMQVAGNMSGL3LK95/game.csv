"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, as it aligns with my budget and the value I place on it.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $12000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12000 is closer, it's still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $9500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering our respective positions.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is a step closer, it's still not quite within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
