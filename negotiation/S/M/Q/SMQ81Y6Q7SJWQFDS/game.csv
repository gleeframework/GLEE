"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,600, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
