Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. That price is a little too high for me, but I'm definitely interested. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for this product. It's truly one-of-a-kind. Could you consider $1,500,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob is still significantly under my lowest acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at this level."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need to be a bit closer to my budget. How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,100,000 is a good business decision at this point. It's a significant profit over my minimum, and prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
