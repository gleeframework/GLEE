"I appreciate your feedback, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8,500, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I can go.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and try $8,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can do $9,250. That's the lowest I can go.",9250.0,Alice,5,
