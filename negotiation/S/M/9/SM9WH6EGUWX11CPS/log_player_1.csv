Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  I believe it's a fair price given the value it offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,250,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds left and can potentially get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum value, but I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's the lowest I can go.  This price still allows me to get a fair return on my product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose an offer of $1,500,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, there's no guarantee.  Accepting his offer guarantees me my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
