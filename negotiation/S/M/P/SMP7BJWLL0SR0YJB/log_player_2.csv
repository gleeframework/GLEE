"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be a great owner. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget of $12,000. There's no reason to accept it. You have 9 more rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob. However, I've had other interested buyers, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16000 for it. How about we try $16000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above your budget, but closer. Since you have more rounds to negotiate, it makes sense to reject and try to get a lower price. You can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $14500 for the product. How about we try $14500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about $14250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250.
