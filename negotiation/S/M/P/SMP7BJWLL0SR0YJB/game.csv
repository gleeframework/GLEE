"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be a great owner. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob. However, I've had other interested buyers, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16000 for it. How about we try $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. Let's try to close this deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $14500 for the product. How about we try $14500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still firm at $13500. This price is reasonable for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about $14250?",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $14000.  That's a fair price considering how much we've both moved. Let's finalize this deal.",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $14200?",14200.0,Alice,9,
