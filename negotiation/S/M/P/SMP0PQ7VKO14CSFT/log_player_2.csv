"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price.  I'll see if I can get it closer to $80."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'll hold off for now and see if I can get the price a bit closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I'm still hoping to find a deal a little closer to $70.  Would you be willing to consider that?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I've already compromised a bit by coming down to $82.50. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $70, which would be $76.25. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $76.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $76.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating well, and $76.25 is a reasonable price.  It's getting close to the point where it's not worth risking the deal for a few more dollars.  I'll accept."
