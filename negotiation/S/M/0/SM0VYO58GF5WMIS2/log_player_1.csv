Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm not willing to accept $7,500, which is below my minimum.  I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,750. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not ready to sell at that price yet.  I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident you'll find this product to be incredibly valuable. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and make a counteroffer of $7,900. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not willing to keep negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's the best option for me at this point."
