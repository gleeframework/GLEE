{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a great price, but I have room to negotiate and try to get it even lower. It's too early to buy from John, as I haven't explored Alice's bottom line yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much room there is for compromise.  I'm aiming to get a price closer to my desired range while still being reasonable."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down in price, but $400,000 is still higher than my ideal price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can get closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my price range, but $425,000 is still too high.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. It's still early in the process and I don't want to jump at the first offer that is somewhat close to my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is going back up in price, and $450,000 is getting close to the point where it might be better to buy from John.  However, I have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can get Alice to come down closer to my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 410000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small counteroffer, only $10,000 above my last offer. I want to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to go much higher.  I'm hoping she will recognize that we are close to a deal and accept this offer."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps going up in price.  We're only one round away from the final decision.  At this point, it's a better value to buy from John.  Even though I'm paying a lot more, I'm guaranteed the product, and it's better than continuing to risk a price that could rise further."
