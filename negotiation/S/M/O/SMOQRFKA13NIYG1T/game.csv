"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $105. This price would still allow you to make a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
