"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's in Bob's best interest to try to get a lower price. A counteroffer will allow Bob to test Alice's willingness to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000, which is still lower than John's price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer will save Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially driving the price back up is present.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
