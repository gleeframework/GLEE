Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. It's a great deal you won't want to miss!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or a potential acceptance at a price exceeding your minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Feel Good:** While $95 is higher than Bob's perceived value, it allows for the possibility of a counter-offer. If Bob negotiates down to a price between $80 and $95, he'll feel like he got a deal, even if it's above his initial valuation. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your minimum price or that John is a guaranteed buyer."
