This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum of $1,000,000 but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $810,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.

While I'm starting to feel the pressure of John's offer, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't accept anything below $850,000.  I'll make a final counteroffer and see if we can close the deal."
