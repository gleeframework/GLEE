"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
