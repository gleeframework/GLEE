Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive offer."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially pushing the price a bit higher.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000.  This strategy prioritizes a higher potential profit with Bob while maintaining a safety net."
