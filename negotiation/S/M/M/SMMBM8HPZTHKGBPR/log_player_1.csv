"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to talk about selling this product to you. I think it could be incredibly valuable for your needs.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:**  While the initial price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, framing it as ""incredibly valuable"" and being ""open to discussing"" can soften the impact and make Bob feel like he has room to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer. This knowledge empowers you to be firm in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:**  Acknowledging Bob's counteroffer shows you're engaged in the negotiation. However, the counteroffer is still significantly above both your floor price and Bob's initial offer, demonstrating your product's value.
* **Strategic Movement:** Coming down by $250,000 is a substantial concession, signaling a willingness to negotiate but without drastically undercutting your position.
* **Middle Ground Illusion:** Framing the counteroffer as ""meeting in the middle"" can be psychologically appealing, even though it's not a true middle ground based on the initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,750,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $1,100,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $100,000, indicating he might be hesitant to move closer to your desired price range. 
* **Time Factor:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. While selling to John is always an option, there's still room to try and secure a better deal with Bob. 
* **Next Steps:**  A rejection now should be accompanied by a firm message emphasizing the product's value and potentially hinting at the option of walking away if a more reasonable offer isn't presented."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we might have different valuations for this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is simply too far off from what I consider fair value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  It's time to apply more pressure. The message is direct, stating that Bob's offers are not in a realistic range.
* **Limited Flexibility:**  Reducing the offer to $1,600,000 is a smaller concession, indicating less willingness to budge further.
* **Alternative Option Hinted:**  The mention of ""exploring other options"" serves as a subtle reminder of John and the potential for walking away from the negotiation.
* **Final Offer:** By explicitly labeling this as your ""final offer,"" you're creating a sense of urgency and putting the ball firmly in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down.  However,  $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. My absolute limit is $1,200,000.  If you can't meet that, I understand, but I won't be able to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has now explicitly stated that $1,200,000 is his absolute maximum price. This suggests he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Time Remaining:** While there are still rounds left, the potential gains from continuing are minimal given Bob's stance. 
* **Profitable Deal:** Accepting $1,200,000 is still a significant profit for you, even if it falls short of your initial aspirations.

**It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale entirely by pushing Bob too far.**"
