"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let's close this deal!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $105 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $115 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $112.50, but that's really my bottom line. I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable.",112.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $106.25. Can you consider that?",106.25,Bob,8,
