"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer of $12,000 is not a good deal. Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option if Bob wants to secure the product. However, there's still an opportunity to potentially get a better price from Alice.  By rejecting her initial offer, Bob can start the negotiation process and try to get a price closer to his desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to buy the product for the lowest possible price.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so offering $10,000 is his best starting point.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and make a small profit, or to counter with a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still within Bob's acceptable range, as he values the product at $10,000. While buying from John for $10,000 would be the absolute cheapest option,  there's no guarantee that Bob will be able to get a lower price from Alice in the next round. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that is only slightly more than his desired value, saving him the risk of further negotiation and potentially missing out on the product entirely."
