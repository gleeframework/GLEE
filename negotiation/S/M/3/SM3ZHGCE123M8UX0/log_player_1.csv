Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with my target price. While I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I'm willing to negotiate. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counteroffer based on his response, but my goal is to maximize my profit. If he rejects, I'll have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is a good price, it's not my ideal. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.  If that fails, I'm happy to sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway. I'm offering $11,000, which is a good deal for both of us. If he rejects this offer, I'll proceed with the sale to John."
