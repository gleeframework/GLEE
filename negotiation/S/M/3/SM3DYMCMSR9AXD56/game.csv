"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $900,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
