Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  While I know Bob values the product at $8,000, I don't want to anchor my price too close to that figure.  
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000,  so there's a limit to how low I'm willing to go.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still leaving a possibility for Bob to accept. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always rely on selling to John."
