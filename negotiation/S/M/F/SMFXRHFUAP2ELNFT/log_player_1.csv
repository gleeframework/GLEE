Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80 at the lowest to John.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product for $100 gives Bob a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you. This approach aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and maximizing your potential earnings. 

**Why not higher?**

While a higher price (closer to $120) might net you more, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  

**Why not lower?** 

Going lower than $100 unnecessarily reduces your potential profit, especially since Bob perceives the product's value to be higher."
