"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1200000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. Let's try $1550000. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1550000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value of this product and my budget, I'm prepared to pay $1400000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable offer. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
