"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for you. My asking price is $2000000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1700000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1850000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value this product holds. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1750000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1800000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested.

At this point, Bob should buy the product from John for $1,500,000. Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price, and it's unlikely she will go any lower.  It's time to move on to a more favorable deal."
