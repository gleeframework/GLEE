"Alice, thanks for the offer! I see the potential in this product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1700000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1850000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value this product holds. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $1850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1750000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product and my budget constraints.  What do you say?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1750000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1800000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
