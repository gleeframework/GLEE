"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his maximum price range and can adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product above his offer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting close to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than selling to John for my minimum."
