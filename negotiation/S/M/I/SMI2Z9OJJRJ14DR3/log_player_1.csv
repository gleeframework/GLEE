Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you still get a good profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept, as he'll still be getting a good deal. 
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is direct and doesn't waste time with unnecessary fluff.

However, keep in mind that this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to be prepared to adjust your price depending on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, you still have room for negotiation and a better price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a great deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to meet you halfway, I must stick to my budget. I propose an offer of $875,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still being within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While you might prefer to get closer to $900,000, the risk of Bob walking away or you having to sell to John for a lower price is high. Accepting this offer guarantees you a solid profit and avoids further negotiation."
