Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its value to you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Here's why:

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoiding a Lowball:**  Starting too high (close to $12,000) could scare Bob away.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John.

By offering a price that's a win-win for both parties, Alice increases her chances of closing the deal with Bob at a price that's significantly higher than her backup plan."
