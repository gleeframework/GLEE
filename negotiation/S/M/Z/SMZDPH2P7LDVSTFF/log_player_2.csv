We're confident it will meet and exceed your expectations. Please let us know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice is overselling:**  Alice's message uses a lot of sales tactics (""premium product"", ""exclusive opportunity"", ""exceptional deal"") to inflate the perceived value. She even claims it's worth $150 to you, which you know isn't true.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're a savvy buyer. Alice might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale.
* **John is your backup:**  You have the security of buying from John at $150. This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice."
