{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  It's a real steal at that price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message is open to Bob's counteroffer, allowing for a potential negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and my assessment of his willingness to pay.  I might also want to provide more information about the product to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value might be high to you, but based on my assessment, I am willing to pay up to $14000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial asking price, it's still significantly higher than my minimum. This indicates he is seriously considering the product.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's a good chance I can push for a price closer to my initial asking price ($15,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than his. The goal is to reach a mutually acceptable price within the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $14,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me. How about $14,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is $500 higher than Bob's offer, which is a reasonable compromise. It shows flexibility without immediately dropping my price too much.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still above my minimum price, ensuring I get a good return on the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone, emphasizing the value of the product and fostering a collaborative negotiation.

**Next Steps:** 

Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he accepts, great! If he counters again, I'll weigh the offer and consider whether to accept, counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I am comfortable to go up to $14200 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $14,200 is only $300 below my counteroffer and significantly closer to my initial asking price of $15,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation could be time-consuming, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product quickly and for a price that is above my minimum threshold and is also a fair compromise.

**Next Steps:** I will accept Bob's offer, finalize the transaction, and move on to other opportunities."
