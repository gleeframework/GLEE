"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, while still providing me with a substantial return. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than what Bob could get from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product for a lower price from John."
