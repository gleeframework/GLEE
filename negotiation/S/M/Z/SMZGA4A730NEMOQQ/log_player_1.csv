Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000 before considering selling to John."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum.

Let's find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
