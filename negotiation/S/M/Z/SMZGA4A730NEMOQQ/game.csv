"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its field and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. My asking price is $1200000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $900000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1000000, but I'm confident this product will generate more than enough value to justify that price.  Let's find a number that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $950000 is getting closer to where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $975000.  This shows my commitment to reaching a deal with you.  I truly believe this product will exceed your expectations and I'm confident this price reflects its potential value.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $970000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $970000?",970000.0,Bob,6,
