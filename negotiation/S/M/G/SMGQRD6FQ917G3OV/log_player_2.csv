"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is less than John's price, it's still more than what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to aggressively push for a lower price, but not so low that it's immediately rejected. Offering $950,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and puts the pressure on Alice to negotiate. This also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but still above what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still potential to negotiate a lower price.  Continuing the negotiation process gives Bob a better chance of getting a lower price than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000) as he knows Alice won't accept less than that. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's serious intent to buy while staying within his budget and leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
