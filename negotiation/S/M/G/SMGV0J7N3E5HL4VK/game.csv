"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $90?  That's still a good deal for you and fits better with my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $95. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $97.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",97.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",95.0,Bob,6,
