"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $100 is above your maximum budget of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation since Alice is willing to sell for $80.  

**Strategy:** You'll try to get a better price in the next round by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $90?  That's still a good deal for you and fits better with my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $95. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $95 is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation, as Alice is willing to sell for less than $100. 

**Strategy:**  You'll continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $97.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice is coming down in price, $97.5 is still more than you'd like to pay. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate, as Alice is willing to come down from her initial price. 

**Strategy:** You'll continue to try and negotiate a lower price in the next round. You're getting closer to your desired price, and you want to see if you can push for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 95}
