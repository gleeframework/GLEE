Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This gives you a chance to secure it immediately. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Offering it at $12,000 is a significant but not outrageous markup. It allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Scarcity Tactic:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly create a sense of urgency and potential competition.

This strategy aims to find the sweet spot between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob doesn't find the price too high and reject the offer outright."
