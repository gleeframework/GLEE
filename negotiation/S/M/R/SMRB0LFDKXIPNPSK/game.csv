"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While I acknowledge the value you've identified, I believe the product holds greater potential than reflected in your offer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1500000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal considering the product's capabilities.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
