"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $9250. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal. Let's try to close this deal. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
