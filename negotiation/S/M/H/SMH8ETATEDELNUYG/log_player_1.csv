Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend at this time. Would you be willing to come down to $9000? I believe this would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a common ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $9,250. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal. Let's try to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
