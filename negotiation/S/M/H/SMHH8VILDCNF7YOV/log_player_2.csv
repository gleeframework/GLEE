"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get a better deal from John, so it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum, it's still above your target of $80.  You can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, it's still too high. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $80 and avoid further negotiation.  You've already spent a few rounds, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal with Alice."
