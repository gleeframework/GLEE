Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""backup plan.""
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and you want to maximize your profit.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum value increases the chances of acceptance.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a significant return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message starts by emphasizing exclusivity and value, setting a positive tone for a high-value negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,400,000 price tag is $100,000 below Bob's perceived value. This creates a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" subtly implies that the product is worth even more than the asking price.

**Important Note:**  While this offer is strong, be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have some wiggle room before reaching John's offer."
