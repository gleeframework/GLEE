"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a successful transaction. Let's find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
