Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worth attempting.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price close to your minimum acceptable price ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **""Special Price"" Psychology:** Presenting the offer as a ""special price"" might make it more appealing to Bob, even though it's just below your minimum. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will reject this offer outright. However, since you have John as a backup buyer, the risk is minimal."
