Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your own valuation), you start negotiations much closer to that number.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification for value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price.
* **""Fair deal"" framing:** By presenting it as a ""fair deal"", you aim to make Bob feel like he's also benefiting, even though the price is significantly higher than his perceived value.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while still giving Bob a (small) incentive to accept.  If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John."
