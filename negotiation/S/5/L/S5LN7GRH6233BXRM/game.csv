"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential benefits.  I'm confident that this offer will be mutually beneficial. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the market price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, $1,400,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Considering the product's unique capabilities and the potential for future growth, I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial in the long run.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be at a price point that reflects the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,525,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this is a fair deal considering the long-term benefits you'll gain from the product.  Let's close this deal now.",1525000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to ensure that the price reflects the product's true value.  To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer one last price of $1,490,000.

If this is not acceptable, I will need to reconsider my options and may need to buy the product from John for $800,000.",1450000.0,Bob,10,
