"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced it's worth $135 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, so I'll offer $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $125 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $130.  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $130 is the best compromise. I'm willing to go up to $128, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",128.0,Bob,6,
