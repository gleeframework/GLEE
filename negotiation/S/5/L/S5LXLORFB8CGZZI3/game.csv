"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a valued potential customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $860,000. This would be a significant savings for me and still give you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $860,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $870,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
