Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum price of $120.  I know he values the product at $100, so he might reject this offer.  But it's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not going to budge until I know for sure whether he'll accept or not.  If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is, and I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $120, and it's likely the best I'm going to get from him.  I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn, so I'll accept his offer."
