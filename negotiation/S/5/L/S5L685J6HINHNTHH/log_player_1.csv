Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $12,000, which sets a baseline. However, I want to maximize my profit.
* **Anchoring High:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($18,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if I started at or slightly above $12,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price gives me room to negotiate. If Bob counters, I can gradually decrease the price, making it seem like I'm making concessions.
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, which gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

This strategy aims to balance ambition with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
