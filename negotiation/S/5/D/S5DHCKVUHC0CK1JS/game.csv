"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10200.0,Alice,3,
