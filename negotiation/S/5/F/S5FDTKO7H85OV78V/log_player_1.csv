Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without explicitly revealing her minimum. 
* **Alternative:** Highlighting that Bob gets the first chance before a public listing creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's thoughts, making him more likely to engage in a counter-offer.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice still has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum price."
