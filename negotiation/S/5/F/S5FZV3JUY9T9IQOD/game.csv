"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $80 to you, right? Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a great price for a product worth more than $80 to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $70. Would that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm not going to drop my price to $70. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  This is a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle this right now at $80? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",80.0,Bob,6,
