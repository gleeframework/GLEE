"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $100.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $140 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $150 to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for some back-and-forth to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to get closer to your initial asking price of $140.  There are still 8 rounds left, and by rejecting his offer, you can potentially negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to your initial offer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $120 is a halfway point between your previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $100.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a phrase like ""let's meet in the middle"" keeps the negotiation friendly and encourages Bob to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is too low, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is not your ideal price, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer of $100. Considering we're already in round 4, there's a good chance Bob won't budge much further.  It's better to secure a sale at $110 than risk further negotiations and potentially end up selling to John for $100."
