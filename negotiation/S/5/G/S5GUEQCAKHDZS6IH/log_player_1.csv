Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. This means he has a $500,000 ""surplus"" value.
* **My Floor:** I have a minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 because I can sell to John for that amount.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price of $1,400,000, which gives Bob a $100,000 surplus. This is a good compromise, likely to be accepted by Bob while maximizing my earnings.
* **Risk:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, the $100,000 surplus makes it more likely he'll accept."
