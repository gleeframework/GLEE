Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $6,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's a fair price for such a high-quality product."", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,200 is still quite a bit below my asking price. To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our interaction, so I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is my final offer - take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 8000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already looked at other options and I can get the same product from John for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go up to $7,000, but that's my final offer. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly aware of your backup plan and is trying to use it to lowball you. He's unlikely to go higher, and continuing the negotiation risks a lower final price. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
