Alice's offer is too high, and you can get the product for a better price from John. It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer. Since you can buy the product from John for $100, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
