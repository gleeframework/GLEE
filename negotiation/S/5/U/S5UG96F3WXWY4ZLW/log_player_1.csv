Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start with a higher offer to maximize potential profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than our minimum.
* **Justification for Price:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the higher price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
