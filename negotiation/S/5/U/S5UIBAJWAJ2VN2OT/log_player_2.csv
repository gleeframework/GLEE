"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as you might be able to get a better price.  There's no point in accepting her offer when you have a cheaper alternative available with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we say $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget of $100.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $100, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110. How about we try $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above your budget, and you're getting closer to your limit.  Since John is offering the product for a guaranteed $100, it's more beneficial to buy from John.  You're saving $30 compared to Alice's offer, and there's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price further."
