"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see immense value in. I'm willing to make this a win-win for both of us.  I propose a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a good price within your budget."
