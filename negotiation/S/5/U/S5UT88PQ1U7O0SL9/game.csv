"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm open to negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a better deal, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
