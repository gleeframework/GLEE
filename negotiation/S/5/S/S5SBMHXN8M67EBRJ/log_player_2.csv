"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting it immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price slightly higher than Alice's value of $10,000. This gives Alice some room to make a profit, while still saving Bob a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer.  It's a starting point for negotiation, and Bob is prepared to go back and forth to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what he'd pay John and still leaves Alice with a profit. There's no need to risk further negotiation, as the price is now acceptable."
