"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $120? This still gives you a great price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $110 is still just a little below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
