Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $95.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is higher than your minimum price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $95 is less than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still lower the price slightly without sacrificing too much profit. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can maximize your potential profit while still having room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a slightly higher price, potentially getting closer to your desired $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $85? That would still be a great deal for you, and it would help me get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking $80 is the best price for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firm on his $80 offer, and continuing to negotiate might result in a stalemate. At this point, selling to John for $80 is the best option. It guarantees you a sale and meets your minimum price requirement.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a higher price, and time is valuable."
