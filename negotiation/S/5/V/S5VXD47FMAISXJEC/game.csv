"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget. Would you be willing to do $8,750? That would really help me seal the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
