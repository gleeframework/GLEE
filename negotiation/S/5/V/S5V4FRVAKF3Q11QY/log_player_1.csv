Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000.  It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be pleased with it. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we need to offer Bob an incentive. 
* **Understand Bob's Value:** We know Bob values it at $12,000, so we need a price above that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still securing a good profit for you.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for your minimum acceptable price."
