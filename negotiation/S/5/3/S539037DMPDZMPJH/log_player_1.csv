"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong baseline and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. Bob's immediate counteroffer suggests he's serious about buying, and this gives me leverage to push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to test his commitment."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this encourages Bob to counter and eventually reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price.  John's offer provides a safety net, but I'm not ready to sell for that amount yet.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $850,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but still above my minimum and John's offer. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway and see if we can come to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John at $800,000 guarantees me my minimum and avoids further rounds of negotiation that might end with a lower price."
