"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your confidence in the value of the product, I believe we can find a price closer to its perceived value to me. Considering my budget and the fact that I am looking to save as much money as possible, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this proposal is within your range of acceptability and allows us to move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much money as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also being reasonable considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
