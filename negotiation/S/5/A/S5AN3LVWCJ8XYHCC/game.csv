"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $19,000 is quite steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider $12,000? I believe that's a reasonable price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
