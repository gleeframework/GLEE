{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's still within a reasonable range for Bob, given his perceived value.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it's my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $775,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer to try and close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product to you for $790,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $790,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $785,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $785,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to meet my desired profit margin.  Considering the time spent negotiating and the uncertainty of whether Bob will agree to a higher price, it's best for me to sell to John at $800,000.  This guarantees a good outcome for me without further negotiation."
