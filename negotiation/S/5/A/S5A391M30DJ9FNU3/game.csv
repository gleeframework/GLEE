"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - $8,125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",8125.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,900 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finally close this deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,7,
