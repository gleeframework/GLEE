"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to move closer to my initial price. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $675000, but I think that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous counteroffer. Can you consider $662500?",662500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $660000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",660000.0,Bob,10,
