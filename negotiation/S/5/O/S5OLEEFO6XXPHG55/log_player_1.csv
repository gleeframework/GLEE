Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999.  I think you'll find this to be a very competitive price, and I'm eager to make a deal with you.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible. Offering it just below this at $14,999 maximizes potential profit.
* **Create Urgency:** By implying you have other interested buyers (even if you don't), Bob might be more inclined to accept to avoid missing out.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested. Even if he negotiates down slightly, you're still likely to get a better price than John's offer."
