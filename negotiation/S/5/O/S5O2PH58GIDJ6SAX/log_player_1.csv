Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $20,000 gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also signals that I believe in the value of my product.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value to Bob. This can help build rapport and encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:** By stating ""Let me know what you think!"", I'm showing I'm open to negotiating if needed. 
* **Knowing my floor:**  I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I won't accept anything lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $10000. Would you be willing to consider $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer shows his interest, I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price range.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. I don't have to settle for an offer that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to make this work.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify the price. This can help Bob see the worth of my offer and be more receptive to it.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes collaboration. This can help build rapport and encourage a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By saying ""Let's find a solution that works for both of us,"" I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $14000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm closer to my goal, I'm not willing to settle for a loss.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob has shown he's willing to pay more, indicating there's still potential for a deal closer to my desired price.  
* **John as a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation.  $14,000 is getting closer to what I need. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This would be a great price for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm offering a price that's only $500 higher than Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to meet him in the middle while still remaining within my acceptable range. 
* **Emphasizing value and fairness:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price and highlight the fairness of the offer for both of us.
* **Positive and motivating tone:** The message is enthusiastic and encourages Bob to finalize the deal. I want to create a sense of urgency and push him towards accepting my offer. 
* **Close to the finish line:**  This counteroffer is close to my floor price, leaving little room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $14750.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's close, I'm not willing to settle for a loss.
* **Negotiations are stalling:**  We've been negotiating for several rounds, and it seems like we're getting stuck.  Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but not quite there.
* **John is the better option:**  With John willing to pay $15,000, I can guarantee a profit without further negotiation.  Selling to John is the most logical and financially secure decision at this point."
