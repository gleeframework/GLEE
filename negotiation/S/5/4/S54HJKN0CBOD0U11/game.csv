"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested, but how about $140?  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,
