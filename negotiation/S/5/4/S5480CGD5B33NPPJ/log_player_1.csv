"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's estimated value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob. If he rejects, we'll assess the situation and either make a new counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $12,000 for this product. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, we're still within the first few rounds. Rejecting the offer allows us to:

* **Maintain our bargaining position:** Accepting this low offer could set a precedent for the rest of the negotiation.
* **Explore a counteroffer:** We can try to meet Bob halfway or propose a price closer to our original offer.
* **Maximize our potential profit:** We're still within range of potentially getting closer to our desired price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, we'll propose a counteroffer closer to our initial offer of $14,000, considering Bob's budget constraints. We'll aim to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and maximizes our profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay close to my desired value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Clear communication:** The message clarifies our rationale and demonstrates a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but we still have time to potentially get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

We'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, we'll assess the remaining rounds and decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost at $12,000. Would you be able to meet me at that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to take the $12,000 offer, we're still early in the negotiation, and we can potentially get closer to our target. 

* **Maintaining leverage:** Accepting this offer might signal a willingness to settle for less, making future negotiations harder.
* **Maximizing profit:**  We can still try to get a higher price, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Time is on our side:** We have several rounds remaining to potentially reach a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, we'll propose a counteroffer that's slightly higher than $12,000, but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints. We'll aim to find a middle ground that benefits both parties. We'll also carefully consider if selling to John for $15,000 is a better option at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to stay within $12,000. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about getting this, I suggest we close this deal now. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but maintaining value:**  We're making a slight concession, but still trying to get a price closer to our desired value.
* **Urgency and pressure:**  Introducing a sense of urgency could push Bob to accept the offer.
* **Potential for a final offer:** This could be our final offer before seriously considering John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

We'll closely observe Bob's response. If he accepts, we've achieved a good outcome. If he rejects, we'll have to weigh our options: another counteroffer, or accepting John's offer for a guaranteed $15,000."
