"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. To move things forward, I'd be willing to consider $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of what we're discussing.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product, and I hope we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,875,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,700,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  I believe this price is fair and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product. I hope we can finalize this deal.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
