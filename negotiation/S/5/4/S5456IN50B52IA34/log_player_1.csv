Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product, and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,875,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,875,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,700,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  I believe this price is fair and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product. I hope we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could push further, accepting $1,700,000 is a good deal at this point. It's a significant profit over John's offer, and prolonging negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
