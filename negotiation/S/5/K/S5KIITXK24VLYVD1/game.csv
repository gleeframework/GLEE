"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  $11,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $11,200?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  How about $10,800?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",10800.0,Bob,4,
