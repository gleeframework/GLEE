Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
