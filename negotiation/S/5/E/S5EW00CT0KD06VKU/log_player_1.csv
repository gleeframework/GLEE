Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm setting the price at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,200,000) but still allows me to make a substantial profit. 
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob (saving $300,000) and maintaining a positive and encouraging tone.

**Rationale:**

This strategy balances the following:

* **Maximizing profit:** A price of $1,100,000 is a strong offer and likely to be attractive to Bob, especially considering his valuation.
* **Minimizing risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and get my desired value.

By offering a price slightly below my minimum value, I increase the chance of Bob accepting, while still securing a significant profit."
