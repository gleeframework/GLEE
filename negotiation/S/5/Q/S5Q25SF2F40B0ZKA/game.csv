"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable arrangement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the value it brings while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but  $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. While $900,000 is closer to where we need to be, it's still a substantial gap from my minimum.  I'm willing to consider $1,300,000. This offer balances the product's worth with my desire to find a solution.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer!  I can tell you're motivated to sell and I want to be fair.  How about we bump it up a bit to $1,000,000 even? That's a strong offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
