"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still above your target price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to your target price, it's still a bit more than you want to pay.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you another chance to push for a lower price."
