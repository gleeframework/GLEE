"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and benefits, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""features and benefits"" aims to subtly remind Bob of the product's value, potentially justifying the high price in his mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I signal that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is his perceived value of the product, which is significantly below my minimum. I'll reject this and counter in the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Rejecting:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer to show I'm taking his input seriously. However, I clearly state it's too low.
* **Significant Drop:** I'm making a substantial drop in price ($3,000) to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Justification:** Using phrases like ""true value"" and ""reasonable compromise"" subtly reinforces the product's worth while emphasizing the concession I'm making."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk he'll lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a guaranteed profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
