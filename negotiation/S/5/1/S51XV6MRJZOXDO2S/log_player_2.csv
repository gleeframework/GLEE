You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price of $12,000, making it a good deal. There's no need to risk losing the product by rejecting the offer and potentially ending up paying John $12,000."
