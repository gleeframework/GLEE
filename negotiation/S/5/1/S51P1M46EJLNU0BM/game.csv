"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase your product. After careful consideration, I am interested in discussing a more reasonable price. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting your counterproposal. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to the right buyer is truly significant. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but $1,200,000 is too low.  Could you consider $1,900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,600,000 for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
