Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a price closer to my target. There are still 8 rounds left, and I might be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you given the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9200. I really like the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,200 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I've already had a couple of rounds where Bob has refused to budge significantly. There's a risk that he'll continue to lower his offers and I might end up with a deal below my minimum.  

Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is a safer and more certain outcome given Bob's unwillingness to meet my minimum price."
