"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $125 is a bit too low for me. How about $130? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $122.50. Would you be willing to consider that price?",122.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $122.50 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $127.50?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $127.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $123.00. Would you be willing to consider that price?",123.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. While I appreciate your offers, $123 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $122.00. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",122.0,Bob,8,
