"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too far below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob or, as a last resort, sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still leaves some room for Bob to come up in price. I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm starting to get nervous about time running out, I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him a bit higher.  I think I can get closer to my goal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering again with a price of $10,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's perceived value, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping that seeing my willingness to compromise will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While time is running out, $9,000 is still too far below my minimum desired price.  I think I can still get a better deal from Bob, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get Bob to meet me in the middle. I'm offering $9,750. This is only $250 above his offer, showing that I'm ready to close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'm going to sell to John.  I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. With only two rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high. I've reached my limit with negotiations and don't think I can get a better price from Bob at this point. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and minimizes the risk of ending up with nothing."
