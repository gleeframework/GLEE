Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $150, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see how Bob reacts and how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is way too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum value, and it's not worth risking a sale to John for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. This is a fair compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a bit closer to my minimum, it's still not worth selling for. I'm going to reject his offer again and make another counteroffer. I'm starting to think Bob might not be willing to pay a fair price, but I'll give him one more chance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  I'm coming down a bit more, but I'm still confident this is a fair price. If he rejects this, I'll go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay a price that's close to what the product is worth to me.  I've made multiple concessions, and it doesn't seem like he's budging.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to make more, $150 is still better than $95."
