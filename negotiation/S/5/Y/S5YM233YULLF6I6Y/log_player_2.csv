"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is still quite high considering her product's worth to her is much lower. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try one more time to get a lower price before accepting or going with John."
