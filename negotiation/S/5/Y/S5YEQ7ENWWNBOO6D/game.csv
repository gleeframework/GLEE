"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about $10500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $10500 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9500 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go any lower than $10000. This price is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable.  Let's close this deal, I think this price is fair for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
