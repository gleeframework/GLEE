Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  Given your value of $800,000, I think a price of $950,000 would be a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.  What are your thoughts?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Given that you value the product at $800,000, I believe a price of $975,000 would be a fair compromise. This would allow for a good profit for you while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
