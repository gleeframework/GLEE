Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still getting a decent profit.  I'm confident Bob will be interested, considering he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take it, I'm going to hold out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's high enough to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to negotiate much higher. While I'd prefer to get more,  selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation."
