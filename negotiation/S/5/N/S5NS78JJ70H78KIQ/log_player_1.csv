"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It also signals that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob, but I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I believe I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm increasing the price to $1,350,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a higher price than his initial counteroffer. This is a strategic middle ground that might push him closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. $1,280,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not desperate to close the deal yet. I believe I can still push for a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $1,320,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and get closer to his price, but I'm still holding out for a price higher than his previous offer.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to achieve a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,290,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned about the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids further negotiation risk."
