"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since I have 10 rounds, there's time to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's fair given its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price, but it's still not within my ideal range. I want to get closer to my target price of $900,000.  With 7 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still not ready to sell the product at $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a good price for me. It's still within my budget of $1,500,000 and a better deal than buying from John.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product and potentially have to buy from John at a higher price.  I'm comfortable with this deal and will accept it."
