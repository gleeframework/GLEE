"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's fair given its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still not ready to sell the product at $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.
