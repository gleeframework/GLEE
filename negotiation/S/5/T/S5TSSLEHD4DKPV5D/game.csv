"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle. I'd accept $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would make this transaction possible. ",12000.0,Alice,3,
