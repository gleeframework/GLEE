"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, given the value we both see in the product.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
