Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, given the value we both see in the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
