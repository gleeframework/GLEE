"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming high initially to give ourselves room to negotiate downwards while still staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" we subtly remind Bob of its worth to him, hopefully making the high price seem more palatable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We don't want to start at our absolute highest since it might discourage Bob from countering. This offer leaves space for negotiation and compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  Bob clearly sees significant value in the product. Rejecting his offer now keeps the door open for us to potentially secure an even better deal. We're willing to risk a lower counteroffer from Bob to try and get closer to the $1,300,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. Would you consider $1,275,000? I believe this price point acknowledges the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're moving closer to Bob's offer but not conceding too much.  This counteroffer splits the difference between his last offer and our previous asking price, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still striving for a strong outcome.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  By reiterating the ""true worth"" of the product, we subtly remind Bob of its value proposition and justify our counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer shows Bob we're serious about finding a deal but aren't desperate to accept any offer. It puts the ball back in his court to either accept a still-favorable price or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but given my budget constraints, I can't go above $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin over our minimum ($800,000) and represents a successful negotiation. 
* **Budget Constraints:** Bob has mentioned his budget limitations. Pushing further risks alienating him or leading to a stalemate.
* **Time Value:** We've secured a great price in only four rounds. Prolonging the negotiation might not yield significantly better results and delays receiving the funds."
