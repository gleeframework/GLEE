"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I think this is a fair price for the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $13,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,500? I think this is the best compromise we can reach.",13500.0,Alice,5,
