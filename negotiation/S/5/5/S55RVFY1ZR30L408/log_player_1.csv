``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and I believe it is a fair price."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,500 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than selling to John and represents a good compromise. It's time to finalize the sale!"
