"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to me, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider given the product's value to him. I want to see if he's willing to negotiate from this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than what I consider a fair deal. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still leaving room for further negotiation. I believe this price is more reasonable for both of us, as it's closer to Bob's offer while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still potential for negotiation with Bob. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for a small increase in price.  I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,025,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While Bob's offer of $995,000 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and it's the safest option at this point."
