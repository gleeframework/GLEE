"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering its worth to you. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1,000,000 if you decline. Let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Saving Money:**  Bob saves $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Better Deal:** Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, Bob gets it for $1,400,000, which is still a good deal for him. 
* **Limited Time:** Alice's offer is limited-time, and if Bob rejects it, he might lose out on this opportunity altogether."
