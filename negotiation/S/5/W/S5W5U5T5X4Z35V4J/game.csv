"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, as that's my maximum budget.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your budget constraints, $20,000 is a fair reflection of the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? This would be a good compromise, and it's still within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
