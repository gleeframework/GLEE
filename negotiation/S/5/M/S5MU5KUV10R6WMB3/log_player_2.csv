Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to your budget limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $132. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we meet at $131?

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really close to your budget limit, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus, though. If you're willing to pay $130, I'll include a free accessory that's worth $10. It's a great value, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. While the price is still above his ideal target of $150, the free accessory makes it a good value. Alice has come down to Bob's final offer, and with only one round remaining, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price, and the added value of the accessory makes it a worthwhile purchase."
