"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of my product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $150. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a budget. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer to see how much room there is for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and expresses my interest while also making it clear I'm looking for a more affordable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By offering $90, I'm leaving space for Alice to counter back, and I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit in price, but it's still above my target. I want to see if I can negotiate further before considering accepting. I'll try a counteroffer a little closer to her price this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm aiming for a price that's roughly halfway between my previous offer ($90) and her current offer ($110). This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards my desired price range.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""win-win"" situation to encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  While $100 is a good price, I'm leaving some wiggle room in case Alice rejects it and I need to counter again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not ready to let go of my product for $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Limit:**  Alice is now at $105, which is getting very close to my maximum budget of $150, and a significant saving compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I push further and reject this offer, there's a chance Alice won't budge, and I'll miss out on a decent deal. It's not worth the risk for a potential savings of only a few dollars. 
* **Time is a Factor:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price, rather than risking a stalemate and potentially having to settle for John's offer later."
