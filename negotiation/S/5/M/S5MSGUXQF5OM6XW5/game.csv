"Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, just as it does for me. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects its potential and the strong benefits I know you'll reap from it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $800,000 is a bit below my ideal value, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This price acknowledges your needs and still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
