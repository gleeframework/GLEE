"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to pay the full $15000. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to compromise, Bob. I appreciate that. However, $11000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12500.0,Alice,5,
