{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value ($12,000) but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to counter his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for that low.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's a sure thing, and it ensures I get what I need."
