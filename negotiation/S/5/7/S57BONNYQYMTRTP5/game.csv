"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you $155. It's a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want this product, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $152.50. That way we both save a little bit.",152.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to be flexible, Bob, but I think $152.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'll meet you at $157.50. It's a good compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think?",157.5,Alice,7,
