# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued engagement in this discussion. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I'm proposing a price of $1,290,000 for the product. This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while also reflecting our position. I hope this offer meets your expectations and allows us to reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for the lowest possible price.  Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is within Bob's budget and only slightly higher than his most recent counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price reductions.  Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ensures that Bob acquires the product while staying within his budget."
