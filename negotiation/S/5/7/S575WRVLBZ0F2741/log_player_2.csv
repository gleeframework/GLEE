"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and it's worth much more than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your $80 limit and what John offers. You can do better by rejecting this offer and going with John."
