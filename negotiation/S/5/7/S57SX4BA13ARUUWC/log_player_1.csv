Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $15,000, I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob. This gives me leverage.

**Strategy:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I won't go below $15,000 as that's my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a price that is more favorable to me. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product, and if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness. If he's willing to accept this price, it means he values the product more than he initially stated. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider a lower price or sell to John.

**Strategy:**

I'll be prepared to go lower if necessary, but I want to see how far Bob is willing to go before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting close to my minimum price, but it's still not enough.
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further could take more time and effort.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and guarantees a sale with no further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

While I'd like to get a higher price, the certainty of a sale with John outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal with Bob. It's important to prioritize securing a sale over pushing for an extra $500 or $1,000."
