"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $800,000 to her, and she's asking for $950,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You can always get the product from John for $1,000,000 if you can't strike a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still gives you a significant benefit, and it allows me to achieve a fair return. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.** While she has come down, $900,000 is still above the product's worth to her.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You've already made one counteroffer, and you have several rounds left. 
* **Buying from John remains a good backup option.** If you can't get a lower price from Alice, you can still secure the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $875,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price.**  $890,000 is only $40,000 more than your last counteroffer, and significantly lower than John's price.
* **You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.**  Continuing to reject offers might risk losing the deal, as Alice might be unwilling to go lower.
* **Accepting is a good compromise.** While you could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the potential for a deal to fall through is increasing. It's a good idea to accept this offer and secure the product."
