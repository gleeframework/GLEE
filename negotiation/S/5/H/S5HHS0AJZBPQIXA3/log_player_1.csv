Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while still allowing for some profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
