"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while still allowing for some profit for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This price reflects the value I have in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Further negotiation might be risky:**  Pushing for a lower price could lead to Alice rejecting further offers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, and avoids the risk of a deal falling through."
