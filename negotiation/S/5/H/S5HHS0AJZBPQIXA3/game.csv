"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while still allowing for some profit for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This price reflects the value I have in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
