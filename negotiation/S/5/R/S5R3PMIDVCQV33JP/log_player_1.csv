Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob, but if he rejects the offer, I can always go with John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, but if he rejects it, I'll still have the option of going with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is only $5 more than John's offer, it's still a better price than what I was originally offered. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's no guarantee, and it might just waste time. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $155."
