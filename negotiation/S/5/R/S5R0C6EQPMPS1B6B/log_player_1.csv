Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still aiming for a profit above your minimum. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential benefit to Bob, rather than focusing solely on the price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below $15,000 since that's your guaranteed sale price to John."
