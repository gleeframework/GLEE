"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer lower than $800,000, aiming to secure the product at a price closer to his target value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price. 

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer higher than $700,000 but lower than $750,000, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  I'm willing to offer $725,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a better price, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $740000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $740,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than what he would pay John, and it's a reasonable compromise after a few rounds of negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

Bob should accept the offer and purchase the product from Alice."
