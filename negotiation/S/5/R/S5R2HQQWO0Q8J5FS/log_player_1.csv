Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Please let me know if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), we establish a strong negotiating position.  Even if Bob negotiates down, we have a better chance of securing a price closer to our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially still feel like he's getting a deal.  
* **Guaranteed alternative:**  We know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, so we can confidently hold firm if Bob doesn't offer a price within a reasonable range.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. How we proceed depends on Bob's response and negotiation skills."
