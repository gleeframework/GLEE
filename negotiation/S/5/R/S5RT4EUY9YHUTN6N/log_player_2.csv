"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than the product's value to her ($800,000), meaning there's room for negotiation. There's a significant difference between her offer ($1,200,000) and the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000), giving me leverage to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving some profit for you. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1000000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to achieve a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $1,100,000. This is still lower than my maximum, but it's reasonable considering the value to Alice.  It's likely we won't get a better price, so I'm willing to accept and close the deal."
