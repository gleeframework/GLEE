"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value and my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $700,000 falls significantly short of what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value you've placed on it.",825000.0,Bob,4,
