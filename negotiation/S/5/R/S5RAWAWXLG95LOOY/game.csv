"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity cost of going elsewhere. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
