Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $90. I believe it's of great value and would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $90 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal (saving $10) while still maximizing your profit."
