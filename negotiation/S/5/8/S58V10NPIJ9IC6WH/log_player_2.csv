**Explanation:**

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my preferred budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price. I will likely counteroffer again, aiming to be closer to my maximum budget or perhaps a bit above."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by lowering her price, so I'm increasing my counteroffer to show I'm willing to meet her halfway. This price is still significantly less than her current offer, but it's closer to my maximum budget."
