"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to potentially sell you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget, and he has other options."
