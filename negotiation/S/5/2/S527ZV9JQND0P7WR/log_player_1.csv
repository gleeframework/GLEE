Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is higher than your minimum price of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $10,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000), giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate a higher price without reaching a point where he's no longer interested. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially achieving a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is higher than John's offer, it's still below your desired profit margin and significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of the product.  

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  This gives you a strong position for a counteroffer.
* **Increase your potential earnings:**  You can aim for a price closer to your initial offer of $10,000 or even higher. 

By continuing the negotiation, you have a better chance of achieving a more favorable outcome than settling for $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Attractive offer:** $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his perceived value of $12,000.
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, while also putting pressure on Bob to accept.

This approach aims to achieve a balanced outcome where both parties feel they have gotten a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $9,250 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $9,500 and significantly closer to your initial target of $10,000.
* **Profitable:**  This price ensures a profit above your minimum of $8,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price or a stalemate, forcing you to sell to John at a lower price. 

Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and secures a profitable sale."
