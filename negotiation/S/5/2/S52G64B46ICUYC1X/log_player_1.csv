Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to maximize my profit. If he rejects, we can negotiate further. However, I'm aware that John is a safe backup option at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for more. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm reducing my price from $18,000 to $16,000, meeting Bob halfway. This shows flexibility and signals a willingness to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a lower offer or a long negotiation process is not worth it. Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed, reasonable outcome."
