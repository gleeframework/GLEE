"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still within your budget to potentially negotiate further and potentially save more money.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $80?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price of $80. I'm willing to take another round of negotiation to see if we can meet closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $82.50. That seems like a reasonable compromise that would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $82.50 just yet. How about we try to get closer to my original price of $90? I'm willing to meet you at $87.50. It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is closer to my target price, $87.50 is still higher than I'm willing to go at this point. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at a price closer to $82.50."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $82.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $82.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $86.25. It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $86.25 is very close to my ideal price of $82.50. With only 3 rounds left, I'm concerned that continuing to reject offers might push Alice to a price closer to $100, making the deal less attractive. I'm happy to accept this offer and secure the product for a price within my budget."
