"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $80?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think that's a fair compromise.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $82.50. That seems like a reasonable compromise that would allow us to close this deal.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $82.50 just yet. How about we try to get closer to my original price of $90? I'm willing to meet you at $87.50. It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $82.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $82.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $86.25. It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",86.25,Alice,7,
