"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to satisfy my goal of maximizing profit. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm lowering my price to $82.  This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that allows us to reach an agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $78 is getting close, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed profit. I'm going to sell the product to John for $80 to secure a sale and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
