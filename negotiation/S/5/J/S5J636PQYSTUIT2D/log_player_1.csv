Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I'd like to save as much as I can. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $90.  Selling to John for $100 is a sure thing and avoids further negotiation."
