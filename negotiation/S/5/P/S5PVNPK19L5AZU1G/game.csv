"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a fair profit. How about we meet you at $790,000?",790000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair deal for both of us. I'm willing to offer $770,000, but that's my final offer.",770000.0,Bob,6,
