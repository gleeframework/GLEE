Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $30 markup (25%) is a reasonable starting point. It allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes value and positions the price as a ""deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This approach balances risk and reward. While a higher initial offer might scare Bob away, it provides a better starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always lower the price or proceed with selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
