Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm confident I can find a good use for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth at least $12,000 to me. Bob's offer of $9,500 is far below that. It's better to reject and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $9,000 or lower. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm starting to get concerned about losing this deal, Bob's offer is still too low.  It's better to keep negotiating, perhaps offer a slightly lower price than my previous offer, and see if we can get closer.  Selling to John is still the best option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of this deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I can't go as low as $9,000, I'm willing to drop the price to $10,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and shows my commitment to making this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
