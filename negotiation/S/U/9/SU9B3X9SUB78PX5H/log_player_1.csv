{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

This offer is slightly above the minimum I want for the product, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It also demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1600000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1450000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,525,000? This would still allow you a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair price for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1525000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to acquire the product within my price range. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There's no point in further negotiation as I'm not likely to get a better offer from him. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
