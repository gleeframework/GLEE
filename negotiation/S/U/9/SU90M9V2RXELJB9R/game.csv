"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Can we meet in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with $12500. I can do $13000, which is still a great value for this high-quality product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
