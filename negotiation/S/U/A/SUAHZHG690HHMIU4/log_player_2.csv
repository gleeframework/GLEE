"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer to save money. You have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This sets the stage for negotiation and shows I'm serious about getting a good deal. While it's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, it allows for a starting point to work from."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have several rounds left, so I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping it below my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price considering Alice is already dropping her price, and it leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
