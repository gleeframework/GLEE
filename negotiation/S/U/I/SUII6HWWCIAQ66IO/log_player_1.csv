Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Starting High:**  Offering a price of $14,000 allows room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, but it sets a strong starting point.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. You might need to adjust your price based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
