Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're confident in the product's worth.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,250 is still a good deal and closer to my minimum value. Accepting this offer is the best choice considering the risk of further negotiation and the chance of Bob walking away completely."
