"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good starting point, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice or by buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore these options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. To make this deal work, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This would allow us both to achieve a favorable outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $875,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to his target, he can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's still room to lower the price further. Additionally, Bob can always choose to buy from John for $800,000 if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's split the difference and go with $862,500. This would be a significant saving for me and still allow you to get a good price for your product."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $862,500. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $880,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on getting the best possible price. While $880,000 is a better offer than previous rounds, it's still above his ideal target of $800,000.  He has the option of buying from John for that price, so continuing to negotiate with Alice makes sense.  There's still potential to get a lower price, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm grateful for your continued willingness to negotiate. While $880,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a price that aligns better with my budget.  I'm offering $850,000 for the product. This price would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to sell the product quickly while I get the best possible value. Let's close this deal on this price, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best possible value, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $870,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I believe this is the best we can do, and I'm willing to stand firm on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $870,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, but it's still a bit high.  Since Bob is running out of rounds and has the option to buy from John for $800,000, it's now in his best interest to accept the guaranteed lower price from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks going over the 10 rounds and potentially losing out on the better deal from John."
