Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what I would get from John, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate would only result in further delays and potentially a lower price."
