"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to try to meet somewhere in the middle. I am proposing a price of $9,250 for the product. This is my best offer based on the value I place on it. I hope this aligns better with your budget.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  If you're serious about making a deal, I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. After considering our previous discussions, I am willing to lower the price to $9,500. This is the most I can reasonably reduce the price while still ensuring a fair return for myself. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
