You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $1,000,000 saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though you could get the product for less from Alice (since it's worth $800,000 to her), you are still saving money by accepting her offer."
