"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price would allow both of us to benefit from the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
