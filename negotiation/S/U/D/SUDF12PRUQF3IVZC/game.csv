"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to make a living, and I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $150. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into acquiring it.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise and offer $130. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of $145. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one more counteroffer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of $140. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've already made one more counteroffer than I planned, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that complements the product perfectly, and I think it's worth at least $20. So, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get.",160.0,Alice,7,
