"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget:** $110 is less than my maximum of $150.
* **Meeting in the middle is a good compromise:** While I offered $100, Alice came down from $120 to $110, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Saving money is important:**  Accepting this offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John."
