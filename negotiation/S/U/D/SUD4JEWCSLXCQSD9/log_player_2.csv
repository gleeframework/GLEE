"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum price and what John offers. You can save $2,000 by going with John."
