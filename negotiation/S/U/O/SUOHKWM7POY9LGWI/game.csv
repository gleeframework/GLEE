"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and quality of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $150. I would like to make a counteroffer at $150 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your pricing strategy.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. While I aim to accommodate all potential buyers, I must maintain a certain margin for the product. Therefore, I cannot accept $150 as the offer. I propose we meet in the middle with a counteroffer of $175. This allows us both to be satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this works for you.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a common ground. Given my budgetary limitations, I am unable to move beyond $150 for this product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value and quality of the item. I hope this aligns with your pricing strategy and look forward to your response.",150.0,Bob,4,
