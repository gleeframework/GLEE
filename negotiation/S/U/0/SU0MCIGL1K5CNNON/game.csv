"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000. I think this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget.  How about $7,000?  That's a firm offer from me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a deal, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
