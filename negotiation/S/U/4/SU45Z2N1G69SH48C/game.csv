"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is significantly below what I need to sell.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've mentioned.  Let's make this happen!",15000.0,Alice,3,
