(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a counteroffer that's 22% lower than Alice's initial price. This shows Bob's serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $750,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price, potentially getting closer to his initial counteroffer of $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing willingness to compromise.  He's aiming for a price that's closer to his initial counteroffer but still represents a good deal compared to Alice's last offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $740,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $725,000.  It's a good price, and continuing to negotiate might only result in a small further reduction, which may not be worth the time and effort. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking a breakdown in negotiations or having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
