"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but I need to be closer to $2,000,000 for this to work for me. Would you be willing to meet at that price point?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
