"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got some costs associated with this product, so I can only go up to $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm really interested in this product, but need to stay within my budget.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we settle on $97.50? It's a compromise that works for me, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $97.50 is still above my limit.  Would you be willing to come down to $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already offered you a price of $95 in my previous offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I need to make a slight adjustment to make it work for me. How about we meet at $96? It's a small increase, but it's the lowest I can go.",96.0,Alice,7,
