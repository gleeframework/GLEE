Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is serious about purchasing the product and what his perceived value might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,800,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a profit and is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, $1,850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and secures a sale. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further rejections, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
