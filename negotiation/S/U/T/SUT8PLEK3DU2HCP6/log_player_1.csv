Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  $9,500 is more than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** $9,500 is less than your minimum of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation and potential for a profitable outcome for you. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  This offer shows you are willing to negotiate while still aiming for a good price. 

By offering this price, you invite Bob to engage in negotiations while keeping the door open to sell to John if Bob rejects your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum:**  $8,500 is far below your minimum of $10,000.  This offer is not financially viable for you. 
* **You have a better alternative:**  John is willing to pay you your minimum price of $10,000. This makes selling to John the more attractive option. 
* **Negotiation room:**  While you could counteroffer Bob, it's unlikely he'll be willing to move significantly higher. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the value. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your minimum:**  $9,000 is a compromise, closer to your minimum of $10,000 than Bob's $8,500.
* **Provides room for negotiation:**  The counteroffer leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob is still unwilling to go higher.
* **Highlights potential value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a win-win situation. 

This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than your minimum:**  $8,750 is still far below your minimum of $10,000, making it a financially unfavorable deal.
* **John provides a guaranteed better price:**  Selling to John guarantees you $10,000, which is above your minimum and ensures a profitable outcome. 
* **Limited negotiating room:**  While you could counteroffer, there's limited room for negotiation given Bob's stated maximum.

Since John offers a better price with no risk of further negotiations, selling to John is the most advantageous option."
