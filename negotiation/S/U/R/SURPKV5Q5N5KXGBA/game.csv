"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land around $9,500.  Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,6,
