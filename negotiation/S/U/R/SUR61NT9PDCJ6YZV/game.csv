"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
