"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the significant return you'll see from it."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and even above our own minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and the ""significant return,"" we aim to shift Bob's focus from the price tag to the perceived value of the product.
* **Anchoring:**  This high initial price acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer to be higher than it would have been otherwise. 

**Important:** We always keep in mind the option to walk away and accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product is good, but not quite that good. How about we bring it down closer to market value?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now above his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. We are willing to go lower, but not that low yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It's clear you recognize the value this product offers.  While I'm confident it will exceed your expectations, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,900,000. This reflects a more realistic middle ground while acknowledging the unique advantages this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a significant concession from our initial price to show Bob we are serious about negotiating a deal. However, we are still aiming well above his offer and closer to our minimum price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We continue to emphasize the product's value, hoping to keep Bob anchored closer to our price. 
* **Time Consideration:** As we are only on round 3 of 10, we have time to negotiate.  We don't want to concede too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me here, but that price is still a little high for my budget.  I'm ready to make a deal, but it needs to make sense for me. Would you consider $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, signaling interest. However, $1,350,000 is still significantly below our $1,500,000 walk-away price. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can bridge the gap. We are now getting closer to the point where accepting John's offer becomes a serious consideration."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to find a solution.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a substantial investment from my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal through. However, it's essential the price reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We are reducing our concession size to signal that we are nearing our bottom line. This also puts pressure on Bob to reciprocate with more significant increases in his offers.
* **Finality:** The language ""Let's try to find a solution"" and ""essential the price reflects the true value"" hints that we are reaching a critical point in the negotiation and are serious about our valuation. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With only five rounds left, we need to nudge Bob closer to our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but we're still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $1,525,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, or we might waste valuable time in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John at our minimum price."
