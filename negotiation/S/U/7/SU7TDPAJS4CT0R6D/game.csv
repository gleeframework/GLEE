"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $850,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and your interest in acquiring it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $975,000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and your interest in acquiring it.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a little too high. I'm prepared to offer $925,000. This is a fair price given our previous negotiations, and it's the most I can afford.  If you're serious about selling, I'm sure we can reach an agreement at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. I'm now offering it to you for $960,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",960000.0,Alice,7,
