Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're firm on your price. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a good deal for both of us, and it avoids further back and forth.  Let me know if you're interested.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept the offer.  While he's aiming for $8,000, Alice has come down to $8,750, which is a good price for him and a reasonable profit for Alice.  Further negotiation might get him a slightly better deal, but the risk of Alice backing out or him losing time is not worth it."
