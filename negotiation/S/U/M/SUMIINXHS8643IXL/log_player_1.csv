{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's value subtly reinforces why you're asking for a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and suggests you're open to discussing the price further, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you knew Bob was particularly price-sensitive, you might start slightly lower. However, since you have John as a guaranteed backup, you have more leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know about John. This lack of information works in your favor."
