"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to you. Considering your offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $11,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000.

I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you there.",11200.0,Alice,5,
