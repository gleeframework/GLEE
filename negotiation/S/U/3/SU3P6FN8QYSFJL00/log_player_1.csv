"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it tempting for him to accept.
* **The message** is friendly and focuses on the potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation stalls or doesn't lead to a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is still a good profit,  it's only $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.  The negotiation is still in its early stages, and there's no reason to settle for a lower price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $12,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still trying to secure a better price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and reinforces the value of the product for Bob. It also highlights the fact that this offer is still a good deal for him, making it more appealing.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in this round.  However, I'm still prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider $11500? I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500** is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I've already shown flexibility and offered a compromise in the previous round. 
* There are still rounds left, and I believe there's a good chance I can secure a higher price, especially since Bob has expressed interest in the product.  

By rejecting the offer, I maintain leverage and can continue the negotiation.  I'm willing to accept a lower price, but I'll continue to strive for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's try $12,000. This is a final compromise on my end, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $12,000, which is slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still a good price for both of us. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a limit.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and frames the offer as a final compromise. This creates a sense of urgency and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting. 

This strategy aims to close the deal in this round, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I can secure a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $11000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is just $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, we are now in Round 6, and there's a real risk of not reaching a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.

Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation risk. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale now than risk losing both deals and ending up with nothing."
