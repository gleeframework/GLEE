``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, giving Bob incentive to negotiate, but it also leaves room for bargaining. I'm confident I can secure a higher price than $1,000,000 from Bob, but I'll be ready to walk away if his counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still secure a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position,  $1,350,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,375,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I've carefully considered it, and I would like to propose a price of $1,360,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's a significant improvement over John's offer.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
