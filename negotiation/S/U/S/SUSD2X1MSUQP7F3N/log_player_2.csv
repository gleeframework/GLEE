Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $79.50. That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $79.50 offer secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to buy from John for $100."
