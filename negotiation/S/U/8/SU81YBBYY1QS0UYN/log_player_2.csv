""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $120? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $90, Bob. I've already compromised by offering it to you for $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think you're willing to meet me at a price that's closer to what I'm willing to sell it for. How about we try $110? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $100, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm also aware that you're a serious buyer, and I don't want to lose the sale. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that's acceptable for you.  She's sticking close to $110-$120, and you're already at your maximum budget.  Continuing to negotiate might waste valuable time and you could risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at your target price."
