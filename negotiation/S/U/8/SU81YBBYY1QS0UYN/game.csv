"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $120? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice.  While I appreciate that, $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle on $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $90, Bob. I've already compromised by offering it to you for $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think you're willing to meet me at a price that's closer to what I'm willing to sell it for. How about we try $110? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, I need to stick to my budget. If you're willing to come down to $100, I'm ready to buy. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $100, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm also aware that you're a serious buyer, and I don't want to lose the sale. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,7,
