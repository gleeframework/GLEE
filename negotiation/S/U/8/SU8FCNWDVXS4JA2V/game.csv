,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1800000 for it.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm now offering it to you for $1900000. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1700000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm now offering it to you for $1850000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1850000, Bob. Your latest offer of $1650000 is quite a significant departure from that. I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I'm willing to give you one more chance, but I need to protect my interests. I'm now offering it to you for $1750000. This is my last offer, and I expect you to meet me at this price.",1750000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1750000, Bob. Your latest offer of $1600000 is still too low. I'm starting to think it's time to move on to other interested buyers. However, I'll give you one last chance to meet me at a price that's reasonable. I'm now offering it to you for $1725000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it or leave it.",1725000.0,Alice,9,
