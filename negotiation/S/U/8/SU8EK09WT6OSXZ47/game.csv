"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is a fair price, given its value to both of us. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
