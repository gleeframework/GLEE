"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""potential"" of the product, aiming to frame it as worth more than Bob's current valuation. 
* **Alternative:** Keeping the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. You won't be pressured into accepting low offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While you want to find a compromise, accepting $1,300,000 would be a substantial loss. You have the leverage of John's offer and time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to reach a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (Slightly):** You've reduced your initial offer by $100,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold Firm:** The decrease is relatively small, emphasizing that you believe in the product's higher value.
* **Reiterate Mutual Benefit:**  Framing the negotiation as mutually beneficial keeps a positive tone while pushing for a price closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob has significantly increased his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. 
* **Still Below Minimum:**  $1,400,000 remains below your $1,500,000 minimum. You have room to negotiate further, especially with John's offer as security. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting keeps the negotiation moving and gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I value your willingness to negotiate.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is a final offer, as I already have another interested buyer at a higher price."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly Above Minimum):**  You've come down in price, but strategically positioned your offer just above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning another buyer at a higher price, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Final Offer:**  Declaring this as your final offer puts pressure on Bob to make a decision without dragging out the negotiation further.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Bob might walk away, but you're betting that his increased offer and the ""competition"" will make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me. My final offer is $1,450,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is holding firm at $1,450,000, while you've indicated $1,550,000 is your minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge this gap significantly.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing with Bob risks losing John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer. Time is a factor in negotiations.
* **Minimal Gain vs. Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer would only net you $50,000 more than John's guaranteed offer. The risk of losing that guaranteed offer for a relatively small potential gain isn't worth it. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
