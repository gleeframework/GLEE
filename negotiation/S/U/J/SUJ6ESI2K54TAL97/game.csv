"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, a significant discount from its true value. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit over budget at $11,500. Would you consider $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit higher than your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a complimentary service that's worth $1,000, which would bring the effective price down to $10,500. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
