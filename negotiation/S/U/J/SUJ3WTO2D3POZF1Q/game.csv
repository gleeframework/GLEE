"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to considering.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  This would represent a significant saving for you from your original price, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer at this time.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer the product to you for $9,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,800 is still a bit too high for my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $9,300 for the product. This is a fair compromise and hopefully allows us to finalize the deal.",9300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,600. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9,600 is getting closer to where I need to be, but I'm still just a little bit over budget. I'm willing to offer $9,100 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",9100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,400. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9400.0,Alice,9,
