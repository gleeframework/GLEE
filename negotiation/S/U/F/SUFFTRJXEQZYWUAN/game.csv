"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I want to start with a fair price that reflects the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is my best offer for now.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",975000.0,Alice,5,
