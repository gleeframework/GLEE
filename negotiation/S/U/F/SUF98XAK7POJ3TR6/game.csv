"I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it reflects the value of this product for you.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $1,012,500.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe this product will be worth every penny to you.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I truly value your interest in this product, but I need to be a bit more realistic with my pricing. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.
