Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $125. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($100). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $125 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, or at least feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The price is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($150), ensuring you make a profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives you leverage. You don't need to desperately lowball Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
