"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12750. It's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13250. This is as low as I can go, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for.",13250.0,Alice,5,
