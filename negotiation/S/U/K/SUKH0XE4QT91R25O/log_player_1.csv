Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me. I'm also confident that I can get a better price than John's offer of $8,000 if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than John's, I'm not satisfied with it yet. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price for me. I'm hoping to reach a middle ground with Bob and avoid having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to accept his offer of $8,700 than to sell to John for $8,000."
