Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and demand, which could make Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, suggesting Alice is open to discussing the price further if Bob counters. 

While this offer might be rejected, it sets the stage for a potentially more profitable counter-offer from Bob. If Bob rejects it outright, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with selling to John at her desired minimum."
