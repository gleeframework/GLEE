"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $155?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to purchase it today.",155.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're eager to make a deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a decent profit. I'll meet you at $157.50. That's the lowest I can go.",157.5,Alice,5,
