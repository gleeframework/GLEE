"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
