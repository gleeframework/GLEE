# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget, but we are getting closer.  I will counteroffer again to try to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer, as I have another option available for $8,000. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still above my budget. I have another option available with John for $8,000. It makes more sense to take the lower-priced option rather than continue negotiations and risk going over my budget."
