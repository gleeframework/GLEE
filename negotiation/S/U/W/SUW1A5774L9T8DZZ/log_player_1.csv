Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible, knowing that's my fallback option.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,500 is a strong starting point, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested. 
* **Create Urgency:**  By setting a high initial price, I imply the product is valuable and might encourage Bob to act quickly before someone else (John) buys it."
