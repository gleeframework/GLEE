Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. He might be willing to pay a premium to avoid missing out.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a sliver of room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential profit."
