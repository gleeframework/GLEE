"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than what it costs you personally, with an estimated value of $100. To make this deal attractive for both of us, I propose a price of $110. This way, you save some money compared to its market value, while I am able to recoup a fair amount for my investment. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
