"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of its worth.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,175,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could we settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
