"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  There's no guarantee John's price won't change, and Alice might be willing to come down from her initial price.  Rejecting her offer gives us the opportunity to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a 25% discount is a reasonable opening counteroffer. It shows Alice we're serious about buying but are also looking for a good deal. This allows for room to negotiate while still leaving a significant amount of money on the table for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down some, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and gives us the chance to potentially get a lower price.  We are still within our budget and have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our desired price.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing we're willing to meet her halfway.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
