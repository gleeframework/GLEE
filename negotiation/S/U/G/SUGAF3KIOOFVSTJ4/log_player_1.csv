"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. It's a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and potentially gauge his upper limit.  I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent amount, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a reasonable compromise. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
