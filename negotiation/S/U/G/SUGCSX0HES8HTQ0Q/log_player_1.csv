Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, leaving space for him to counteroffer.
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** By offering a concrete price, you show your willingness to negotiate. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a new offer, always keeping in mind your minimum price and John's offer as backup options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your initial offer and doesn't leave much room for further negotiation. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,750. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is close to your minimum price of $10,000. Accepting it ensures you get a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob or selling to John for a lower price."
