Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm hoping this price feels fair."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to sell to Bob for less. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more. Starting at your desired price leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 

**Important:**  This strategy assumes you're confident John will buy the product for $10,000 if Bob declines."
