Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, we want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product for $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit encourages a prompt decision from Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit. If Bob accepts, we earn more than our guaranteed sale. If he rejects the offer, we proceed with the sale to John at our desired price."
