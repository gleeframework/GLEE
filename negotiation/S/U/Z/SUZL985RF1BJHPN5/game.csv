,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $140, Bob. I can do $155, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to accept $140, Bob. I think you're undervaluing the product. I'll meet you at $145, but that's my final offer.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $142, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",142.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $142, Bob. I think we're getting close, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $148, but that's my last offer.",148.0,Alice,9,
