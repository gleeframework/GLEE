Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will bring you significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" and ""unique"" nature to justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price still significantly higher than your backup offer from John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
