"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $800,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $800,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the potential benefits I see, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being reasonable for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
