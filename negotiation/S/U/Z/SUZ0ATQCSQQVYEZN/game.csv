"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm compensated fairly. I'm prepared to sell for $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and a reasonable price given the product's value. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I can buy it from John for that same price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
