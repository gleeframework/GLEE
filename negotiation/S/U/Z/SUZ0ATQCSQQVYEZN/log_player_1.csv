{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I can still make a good profit ($250,000), while still leaving room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm compensated fairly. I'm prepared to sell for $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and a reasonable price given the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I can buy it from John for that same price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk losing out to John. Accepting his offer ensures I get my desired minimum and avoid any further negotiation."
