Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make another small concession. How about we meet at $122? It's a fair price for a great product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that beats John's offer of $120.  It's better to secure the product from John at a known good price than to risk the negotiation failing with Alice."
