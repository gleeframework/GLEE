"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price well below its worth to you, and I secure a strong return on my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Can you meet me in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $975,000, so I'm thinking of $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
