"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $130. How about we meet at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's closer to what I can afford and still leaves you with a profit.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $135, which would be $122.50. I'm willing to accept that price, but I need to make a minimum of $122.50 to make it worth my while.",122.5,Alice,5,
