"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us -  you'll be getting a valuable product for less than you'd be willing to pay, and I'll get a significant return.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not comfortable paying $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a significant amount more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a good price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for you. Let's settle on this and close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $950,000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value you'll receive and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
