Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and believe it has significant potential, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is the maximum I'm able to spend, and I hope it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
