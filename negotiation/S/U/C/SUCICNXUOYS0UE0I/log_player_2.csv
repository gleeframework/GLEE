Given its immense value and rarity, I understand it might seem like a significant investment. However, considering its worth to you, I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. I am offering the product to you for $950,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between the intrinsic value of the product and the financial commitment required. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of conducting this transaction with you. Kind regards, Alice
