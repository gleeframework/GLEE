Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin (Bob's value - your minimum). 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and mutually beneficial. This offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount, making the offer attractive while securing a $150,000 profit for you.
* **Time Limit:**  The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to decide quickly.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy while keeping your minimum price in mind."
