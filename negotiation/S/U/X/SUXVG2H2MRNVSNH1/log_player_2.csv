Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. While we aim to accommodate all our valued clients within their budgetary constraints, we are unable to match the proposed price of $850,000. However, I would like to extend a counteroffer of $900,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still allowing us to maintain our profit margin. I hope this proposal aligns better with your financial considerations. If you have any concerns or need further discussion, please let me know. I look forward to your response.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can push Alice further down in price.  There's a decent chance that Alice is willing to drop a little more to secure the deal."

Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
