"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the introduction price, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. While we aim to accommodate all our valued clients within their budgetary constraints, we are unable to match the proposed price of $850,000. However, I would like to extend a counteroffer of $900,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still allowing us to maintain our profit margin. I hope this proposal aligns better with your financial considerations. If you have any concerns or need further discussion, please let me know. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway with your counteroffer.  However, I'm still a bit above my target price.  To make this deal work, I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while getting me the product within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
