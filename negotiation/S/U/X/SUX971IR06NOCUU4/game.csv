"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low. Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while you still get a good deal. Let's work together to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a reasonable profit, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a significant concession on my part. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $795,000. I believe this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",795000.0,Bob,6,
