"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential negotiation.
* **Be realistic:**  It's not an unreasonable price considering the product's worth to you.
* **Open the dialogue:** The message encourages Bob to engage in further discussion. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds.  Remember, I have the option to stop the negotiation and sell to John at any time if I feel the deal with Bob isn't beneficial enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desired selling price. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer is simply too far below my floor.  I need to push for a higher price to ensure I get a reasonable return on my product. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'll need to carefully consider the remaining rounds and the risk of losing the deal to Bob completely."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our respective valuations. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

```

**Explanation:**

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round with a price that is closer to my desired range. I need to find a balance between being flexible and ensuring I don't end up with a deal that is significantly below my product's true value. It's important to keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time if I feel the negotiation with Bob is not going in my favor."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's close this deal with this final offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired return.  With only four rounds remaining, I need to ensure I don't lose out on a potentially much better deal with John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my target, but I'll also consider the risk of losing Bob altogether. If the next few rounds don't yield a more favorable price, I may need to start seriously considering selling to John to secure a guaranteed $1,500,000."
