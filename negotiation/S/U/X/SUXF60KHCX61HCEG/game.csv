"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desired selling price. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's work together to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our respective valuations. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and represents a reasonable compromise.  I believe this is a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's close this deal with this final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $950,000 is still not enough for me. Let's aim for a win-win scenario. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This offer represents a substantial compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. ",1050000.0,Alice,7,
