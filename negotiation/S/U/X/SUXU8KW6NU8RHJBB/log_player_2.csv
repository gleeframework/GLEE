"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can get the product for $150 from John, and Alice is offering it for $125, so rejecting her offer is the better option. You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or buy from John."
