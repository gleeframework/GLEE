"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. This price reflects the fair market value and aligns with my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limitations. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1320000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
