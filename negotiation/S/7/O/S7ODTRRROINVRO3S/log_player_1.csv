{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth $90, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think the product is a great deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to get this product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $78 is close to my minimum, I think I can still push for a slightly higher price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $81. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 81} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $81 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $79, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $79 is very close to my minimum, but it's still below what I want.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and saves me the hassle of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
