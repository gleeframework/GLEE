"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm not willing to go any higher than my minimum price of $1200000, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a stalemate. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get the price to at least $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1220000.
