Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** My message emphasizes the value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to see this as a good deal.
* **Openness:** I end with an open-ended question to invite further conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** While it's tempting to accept the $850,000, I'm determined to earn at least $800,000.
* **I have room to negotiate:** I have 9 rounds left, so I can continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can find a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is my last resort, but I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the deal as worthwhile.
* **Positive language:** My message uses positive language like ""good margin"" and ""find a solution"" to create a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit.  Let's try to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 I'm hoping to get. 
* **More negotiation room:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to see if I can squeeze out a higher price from Bob.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $800,000, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 887500}
