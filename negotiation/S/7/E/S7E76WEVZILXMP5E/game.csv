"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit.  Let's try to close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  Let's make this deal happen!",887500.0,Alice,5,
