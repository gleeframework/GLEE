"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Could you do $8,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While the product looks great, $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and do $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
