"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering this deal with me. However, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I acknowledge your proposed price, I believe this product's value warrants a higher figure.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
