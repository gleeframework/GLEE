"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still quite a bit higher than the $1,000,000 I'm willing to pay from John.  I'm going to see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This should prompt her to consider a lower price, but it's also a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for this incredible product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay from John. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push Alice lower. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since she's already lowered her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  However, I'm still keeping it below $800,000, demonstrating that I'm not willing to cave completely.  The goal is to create some tension and encourage Alice to come down even further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $775000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for this incredible product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $775,000, which is within my budget and significantly lower than John's price. This seems like a good deal, and while I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or having Alice become unwilling to negotiate further outweighs the potential savings.  I'm going to accept this offer."
