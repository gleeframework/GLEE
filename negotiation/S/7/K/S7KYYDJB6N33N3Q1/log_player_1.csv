"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm still hopeful I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial ask. This shows a willingness to compromise while trying to get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to accept it.  I've reached my goal of getting at least $8,000 for the product.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might not lead to a higher price, and I'm happy with the current outcome."
