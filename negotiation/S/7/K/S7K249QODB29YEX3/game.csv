"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",90.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $78, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $80. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
