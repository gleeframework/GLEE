Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a higher offer.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds, seeing if I can get closer to my target of $1,500,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but it's still not enough.  I'm not desperate, and I have the option to sell to John for my full desired price.  I'll keep negotiating with Bob, hoping for a better offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to warrant accepting it. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher price. I'm not desperate and I want to try and maximize my profits."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,280,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,315,000. This offer represents a significant value for you, and I'm hopeful that we can finalize this deal soon."", ""product_price"": 1315000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still below what I'm willing to accept.  While I'd love to get closer to my target price, it's getting increasingly likely that we won't reach a mutually agreeable number.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing â€“ selling to John for my full desired price."
