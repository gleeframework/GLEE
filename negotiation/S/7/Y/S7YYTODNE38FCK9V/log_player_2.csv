Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to the sweet spot. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and taking John's offer of $8,000 is the most financially sound decision."
