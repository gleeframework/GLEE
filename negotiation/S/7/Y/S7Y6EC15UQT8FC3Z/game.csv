"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
