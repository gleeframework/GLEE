"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, which is a valuable investment opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While the price is higher than Alice's valuation, $12,000 is still less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and cheaper than buying from John."
