"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to me.  However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider $120? ",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $152.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",152.5,Alice,5,
