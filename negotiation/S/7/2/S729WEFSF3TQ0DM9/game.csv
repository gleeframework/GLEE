"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $700,000 is a significant offer, it doesn't fully reflect the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm open to selling it for $850,000. This price point considers both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
