Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this to be a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value"" and ""potential worth,"" you subtly anchor Bob's perception around a higher price point.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals that you're open to negotiation, making Bob feel more in control. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still securing a significant profit for you (and potentially exceeding John's offer).

This strategy aims to balance a strong opening position with a degree of flexibility to encourage Bob's engagement."
