"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $500000 is significantly below my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1200000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to make a counteroffer that reflects a compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $750000. This offers a fair balance between your budget and the product's worth, while still allowing for a reasonable profit for us.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $750000 is still too low for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. To reach a deal, I'm willing to offer $1000000. This allows for a healthy profit for you and ensures I can acquire the product within my constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
