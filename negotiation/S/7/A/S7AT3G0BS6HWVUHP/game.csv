"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and offers you a fair return.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a compromise.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",925000.0,Alice,5,
