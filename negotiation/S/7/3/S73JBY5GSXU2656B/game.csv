"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,800. It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",8800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,600. It's the last offer I can make and still make a decent profit.",8600.0,Alice,7,
