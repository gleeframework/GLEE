"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above my minimum:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm not starting at my minimum price.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a significant offer:**  The $150,000 difference will make Bob take the offer seriously. 

By starting high, I hope to encourage Bob to counteroffer, giving me more leverage to eventually reach a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it matches my initial offer, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can still push for a better price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer by $25,000 to $1,175,000. This is a small increase, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still holding onto my goal of getting as close to $1,200,000 as possible. 

By making a small increase, I'm hoping to:

*  **Maintain momentum:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but not desperate.
* **Signal that I'm willing to meet halfway:** This might make Bob feel more inclined to compromise in the next round.
* **Keep John's offer as a backup:**  If Bob rejects again, I can still go to John and get a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has lowered his offer to $1,120,000, which is below my initial offer and significantly lower than my desired price. While this might seem tempting due to the dwindling rounds, I still believe I can secure a better price. 

Here's why I'm rejecting his offer:

* **Value of the product:**  I know the product is worth more than $1,120,000 to Bob. This makes me confident that he will come back with a higher offer.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm using this as an opportunity to get a sense of Bob's negotiating style. By rejecting his offer, I'm putting pressure on him to make a more appealing counteroffer. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I still have room to negotiate.  

Ultimately, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000 or even higher. By rejecting Bob's offer, I hope to push him to come closer to my expectations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1140000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $1,140,000. Here's why:

* **Finding common ground:** I'm aiming for a price in the middle between my previous offer ($1,175,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,120,000). This signals a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Showcasing flexibility:**  This counteroffer demonstrates that I am willing to move towards Bob's position while also pushing him to consider coming up.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  By not accepting his lower offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to increase his bid again, hoping to reach a deal closer to my ideal outcome.

This counteroffer is a calculated move to keep the negotiations moving forward while increasing my chances of getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a higher price, we are now in round 6 and the time is running out.  It's time to weigh my options carefully.  

Here's why I'm accepting Bob's offer:

* **Close to my desired price:**  The $1,130,000 offer is within a reasonable distance of my initial goal.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, there's a chance he might walk away, and I could end up with John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited time:** We only have four rounds left. If I reject this offer, there's a chance I won't have time to get a better one. 

Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,130,000. This is a good deal, and it's better than the alternative of selling to John for a lower price."
