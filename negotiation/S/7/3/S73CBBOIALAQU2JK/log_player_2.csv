"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer to try and get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to try and get a deal closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $950000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows for continued negotiation and hopefully a price closer to Bob's goal.  There are still 7 rounds left, providing more opportunities to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $950,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit, and I believe it's a good starting point for finding a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
