"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
