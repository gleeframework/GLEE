Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $12,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,200.
