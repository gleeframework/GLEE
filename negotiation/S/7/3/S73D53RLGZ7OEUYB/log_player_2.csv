"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $12,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. I believe this price still reflects the value the product will bring to your business, and it's a fair compromise considering the market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $10,500 is still slightly higher than my maximum budget. I'll reject and attempt to negotiate a price closer to my target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,200. I'm willing to go slightly lower than my previous offer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $11,000. This is a good price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget. While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that the price won't drop enough to be worth it, or that we'll run out of rounds.  Since John is offering the product for my desired price of $10,000, it makes more sense to stop negotiating with Alice and go with John."
