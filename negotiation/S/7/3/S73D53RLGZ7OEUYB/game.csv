"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $12,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. I believe this price still reflects the value the product will bring to your business, and it's a fair compromise considering the market value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,200. I'm willing to go slightly lower than my previous offer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $11,000. This is a good price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
