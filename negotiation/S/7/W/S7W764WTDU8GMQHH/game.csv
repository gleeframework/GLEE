,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a good compromise and still allows us both to get a decent deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for the product, which is closer to the value I think it's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $925000. This is a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $875000 for the product, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $875000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to sell the product for $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $875000 for the product, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet in the middle, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",875000.0,Bob,8,
