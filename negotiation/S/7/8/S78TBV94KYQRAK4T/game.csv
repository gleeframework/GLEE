"While I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
