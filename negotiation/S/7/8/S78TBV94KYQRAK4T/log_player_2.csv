# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still above my preferred price point, but it's a good compromise. It's closer to my budget and saves me a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer. It's also a better deal than buying from John, as it's only $50,000 more than John's price."
