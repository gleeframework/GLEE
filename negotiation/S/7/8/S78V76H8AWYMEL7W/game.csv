"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $600000. I would like to propose an offer of $550000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $550000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to budge any further. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm at my lowest offer of $675000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if you're not willing to meet me at this price. I think it's time for us to part ways.",675000.0,Alice,7,
