Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a significant profit margin. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so you can aim higher with Bob."
