"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1200000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $1200000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1750000? This is a significant price point for me, but I want to see if we can find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to go to $1400000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $1400000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  Let's make this deal happen!",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm committed to getting this deal done, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1400000. I think this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
