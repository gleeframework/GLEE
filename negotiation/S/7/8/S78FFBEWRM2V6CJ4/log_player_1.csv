"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the benefits for Bob, building a foundation for a potential agreement.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation and counteroffers without immediately triggering a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $1,400,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price:** I believe I can leverage the fact that Bob is interested and potentially push the price higher in the next round. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for a higher price, which gives me leverage in these negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. To show my willingness to make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Not Too Much:** I'm dropping the price slightly to show flexibility, but not by a significant amount. This avoids giving away too much leverage. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive and Open:** The message is encouraging and leaves the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're making progress. I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, and I might end up with nothing.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're only in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing more rounds and potentially ending up with a worse deal. 

While I would prefer to get closer to $1,750,000, the potential of securing $1,550,000 is a good outcome given the current negotiation stage."
