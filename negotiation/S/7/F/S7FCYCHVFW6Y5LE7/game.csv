"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
