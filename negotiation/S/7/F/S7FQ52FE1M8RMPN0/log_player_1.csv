Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but how about $100? It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $95 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I believe I can still get a better price, and I'm not ready to settle for less. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm confident you'll find the product worth that much."", ""product_price"": 100}
