Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good starting point for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
