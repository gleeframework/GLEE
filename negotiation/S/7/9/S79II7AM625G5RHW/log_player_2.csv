"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $1,000,000."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my bottom line.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to our acceptable range, we're still above our ideal price. We're also within our rights to push for a better deal since we have ample rounds left and the backup option of John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the movement. How about $1,150,000? That's a serious offer."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good starting point for a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our exact maximum price. There's no point in going another round as we can't get a better deal from John, and we risk Alice retracting this offer."
