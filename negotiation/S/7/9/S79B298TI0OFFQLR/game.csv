"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,3,
