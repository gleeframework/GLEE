I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over what I'd get from John, but it gives Bob the potential to acquire the product at a lower price than he might be willing to pay. 

If Bob rejects, I'll still make a good profit by selling to John. However, I'm hoping to maximize my gains by capitalizing on Bob's potential higher valuation of the product."
