,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
