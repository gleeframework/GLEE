"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering your valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,300,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,250,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I value your offer, $1,275,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's closer to a price that works for both of us. Let's find a solution that benefits both sides.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
