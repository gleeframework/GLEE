Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering your valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and selling to John is always an option. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,300,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum goal, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and can try to push for a higher price.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, so rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,250,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,275,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I can get from John.  We are now in round 6, and I have 4 rounds remaining to negotiate.  There's still potential to reach a better deal with Bob, so rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I value your offer, $1,275,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's closer to a price that works for both of us. Let's find a solution that benefits both sides."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
