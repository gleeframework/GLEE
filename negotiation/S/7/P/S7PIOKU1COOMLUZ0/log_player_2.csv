"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's always worth exploring options and trying to get a better price. Since you're willing to pay up to $100, a $50 offer is a good starting point, but you can try to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 30}
```

Since I'm willing to pay up to $100, I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's closer to my target of $30."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is better than her previous one, but it's still above my target price. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it below Alice's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also showing that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $42. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $42
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now below my maximum price of $100 and close to my target price. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering the limited rounds and the risk of losing the product to John. Accepting the offer allows me to purchase the product while still saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
