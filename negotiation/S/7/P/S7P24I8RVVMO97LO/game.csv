"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, I believe $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. I'd like to propose a compromise at $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
