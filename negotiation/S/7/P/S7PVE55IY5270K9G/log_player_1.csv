{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives him some room to negotiate while ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$80 is far too low for me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $80 is quite a bit lower, and I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $100 is the best I can expect at this point. It's worth it to me to close the deal and move on rather than risk losing him altogether."
