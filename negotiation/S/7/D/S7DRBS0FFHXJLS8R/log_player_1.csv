"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob, giving room for negotiation. It's a strong opening that shows confidence while leaving space for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at the minimum acceptable value for me, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value and want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $825,000 is my final offer.  It's still a great price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $812500 is a fair price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's likely he won't budge much further.  I'm willing to accept this offer to ensure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or needing to sell to John for a lower price."
