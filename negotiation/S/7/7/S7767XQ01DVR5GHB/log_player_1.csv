Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Bob:**  I'm highlighting the product's value and using a ""fair price"" approach to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $100 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really like the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's below my minimum value of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $100, ensuring I don't lose out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I highlight the ""good deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of losing more:** If I reject and make a counteroffer, Bob might walk away entirely.  
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations could take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome.
* **John as backup:** If the deal with Bob falls through, I can still sell to John for $100. 

While $92.50 isn't ideal, it's a good compromise and minimizes the risk of losing a sale altogether."
