"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the opening offer. This product definitely looks promising. While $700,000 is a fair starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $600,000. Would you be willing to consider $620,000?",620000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $620,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. My new counteroffer is $675,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price for this incredible product.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the need for a profit margin, but I think we're still a bit far apart.  $640,000 is my limit for this product. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, we might need to explore other options.",640000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $640,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. My new counteroffer is $670,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",670000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement on your end. How about we split the difference and settle at $655,000? This offer demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing this product, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",655000.0,Bob,6,
