We are getting close to the end of the negotiation and Alice is still not budging much. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further in the next round or two, otherwise we can still buy from John."

Alice is holding firm, and while we could try one more counteroffer, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. $690,000 is a decent price and saves us $110,000 compared to John. It's time to close the deal."
