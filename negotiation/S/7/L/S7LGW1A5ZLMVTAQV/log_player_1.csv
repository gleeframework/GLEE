"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This sets a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.  While I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and accepts, I'm also prepared to adjust the price if he counters or if the negotiation drags on. I'll keep in mind the value of the product to me ($1,000,000) and the option to sell to John at that price as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe the product holds more value, and I want to explore if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and continue negotiations, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I see in the product.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and accept, but I'm ready to adjust further if needed. I'm mindful of the rounds remaining and the option to sell to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied.  There are several rounds left, and I'm determined to push for a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and see if I can bridge the gap. I'll keep in mind the value of the product to me and the option of selling to John as my fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is another compromise, but I'm still holding firm on the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're getting closer to an agreeable price.  We're now halfway through the rounds, so I'm aiming for a resolution sooner rather than later.  I'll keep evaluating the situation and be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not quite ready to settle yet. We've only got 4 rounds left, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and see if I can push for a higher price. I'll keep in mind the value of the product to me and the option of selling to John as my fallback, but I'm still aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,150,000.  We are in the latter half of the negotiations now, and this is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This reflects my urgency to close a deal, but I'm still holding out for a better price than what Bob has offered. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to agree, but I'm prepared to consider selling to John if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is below my minimum.  While I'm reluctant to sell to John for $1,000,000,  it's clear that I'm not going to get a better price from Bob in these remaining rounds.  Therefore, selling to John is the best option to ensure I secure a sale and avoid completely losing out on the potential profit."
