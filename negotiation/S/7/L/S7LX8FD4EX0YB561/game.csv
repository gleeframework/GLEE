"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's fair for both of us.  I know it's worth $10000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9500.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a price that's more than what I would get from another buyer.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,1,
