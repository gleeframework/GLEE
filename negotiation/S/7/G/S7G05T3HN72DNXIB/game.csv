"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $7,800 is my final offer.  If you can't do that, I'll have to go with John.",7800.0,Bob,6,
