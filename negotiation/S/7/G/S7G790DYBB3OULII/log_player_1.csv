Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price, as it's less than what it's worth to him, but still allows me to make a profit.  I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer, as he's likely willing to pay a bit more to avoid the hassle of potentially haggling further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering at $135. This is still a good price for Bob, as he's willing to pay $150. It also allows me to earn more than I would by selling to John. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to earn a bit more, Bob's offer of $132 is close to my counteroffer and a significantly better price than selling to John. I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiations."
