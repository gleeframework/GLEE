,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to keep your spending within $80, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $110 to break even. Would you be willing to go up to $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Would $100 be a feasible price for us to agree upon?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already had a solid offer from another buyer who is willing to pay $100 for the product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my minimum price. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Unfortunately, I am unable to meet your price of $110. I am still committed to staying within my budget of $80. Could we perhaps find a middle ground?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob, but I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I've already had a solid offer from another buyer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. I'll make you a final offer: $108, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. While I'm still interested in purchasing the product, I must adhere strictly to my budget of $80. I hope this aligns better with your needs.",80.0,Bob,8,
