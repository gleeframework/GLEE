Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price closer to $1,200,000 if needed, knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John."
