"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, hoping to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation.  I'm willing to potentially lower my price but want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than he initially thinks it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while still seeking a price closer to my desired value. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. I'm also aware that John is a reliable backup buyer, but I'd prefer to get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm now willing to accept $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer."
