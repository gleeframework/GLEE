Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? That feels like a fairer price point."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference â€“ $1,000,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm. Accepting at $1,000,000 secures us a significant savings compared to John's offer ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
