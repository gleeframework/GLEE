"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $140 leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to create a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **Time is on My Side:** I still have 8 rounds left, giving me room for counteroffers and finding a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a compromise, making it seem like I'm being flexible and open to negotiation.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $135 is still above my minimum value, allowing me to potentially get a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider going down to $132? That would be a more comfortable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $132 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I can get from John.
* **Time is a Factor:** With 6 rounds remaining, I still have time to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, but it would mean sacrificing potential profit.  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate has a chance for a higher price, though it also carries the risk of Bob walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $133, but that's really the lowest I can go.  If you're serious about buying, I think we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 133}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession by dropping the price to $133. 
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is my lowest price, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:** The message subtly suggests that time is running out, adding pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $133 is still a bit high for me. Can you consider going down to $129? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure to close a deal is increasing.
* **Bob's Persistence:** Bob's continued insistence on a lower price suggests he's unlikely to budge much further. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit that exceeds my minimum value and is significantly better than Bob's current offer.  

It's a calculated risk, but with the limited time and Bob's stubbornness, selling to John offers the most secure and profitable outcome."
