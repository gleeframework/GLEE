"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to do $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $115? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we do $125? I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",125.0,Alice,5,
