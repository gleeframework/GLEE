"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair market value."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a significant offer, but I'm still not sure it's enough to meet my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget.  Bob should try to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to a price closer to $800,000 before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $900,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is firm on $980,000, which is still significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, Bob has two options: 

1. **Continue Negotiating:**  There's a chance that further negotiation might bring Alice down, but it's risky.  It's possible Alice won't budge, and Bob could end up wasting valuable rounds without getting a deal.

2. **Buy from John:** This is the safest option. It guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price, leaving him with no risk of further negotiation failures.

Given the limited rounds and the possibility of a stalemate, Bob should choose to buy from John."
