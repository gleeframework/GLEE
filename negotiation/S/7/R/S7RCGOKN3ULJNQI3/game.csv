"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
