"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite significant. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but the value of this product is truly significant and $950,000 is too low for me to consider. This is my final offer - $980,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that the value of the product is significant, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $980,000, which would be $965,000. Can you consider that?",965000.0,Bob,6,
