Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point that is higher than my minimum but allows for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will either accept, or we can negotiate a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$50 is way too low. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but shows a willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is fair, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm rejecting this offer and will try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm countering with $140. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still lower than my initial price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but that I won't go below a certain price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable.  At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is still a good deal for me."
