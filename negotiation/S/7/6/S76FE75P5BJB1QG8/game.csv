"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $97.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102.50, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. ",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
