"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for something worth a lot more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $100 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($120) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Counteroffer:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $85 is still below my minimum value of $120.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my minimum while still potentially reaching a compromise.
* **John's Offer:**  While $120 is enticing, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that amount through continued negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  $92.50 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value:** This price is still above my minimum of $120, and it's closer to the $100 I was hoping for.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly, emphasizing fairness and the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $90 is still below my minimum value of $120, but I am getting closer to that number.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While it is closer to my minimum, it is still a good starting point for further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I still have several rounds left to negotiate with Bob.  I want to see if I can get a better price, even if I need to make a small counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $91? That's only a dollar more and a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** A small increase from Bob's last offer ($90) to $91 shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes that $91 is a compromise that benefits both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Keep Negotiating:** I'm not willing to accept $90 yet, but this small counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm really trying to be fair here.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $90.50.  That's a great price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $90.50 is still below my minimum value of $120, but I am getting closer to that number. I'm also concerned that Bob's offer suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I have 4 more rounds left to negotiate with Bob.  I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my minimum value before committing.
* **John's Offer:**  While $120 is enticing, I am still confident I can reach a better price with Bob.  I'm hopeful that by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate, I can get closer to my minimum price and maybe even get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try $91.25. It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. I'm confident this is a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 91.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** A small increase to $91.25 from Bob's offer of $90.50 shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.  
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message reiterates the idea of compromise and emphasizes that this price is fair for both parties.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message suggests that accepting this offer will allow them to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and finality.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I am still not at my minimum price but hope this counteroffer will be enough to get Bob to agree.  I still have 3 rounds remaining if I need to continue negotiations."
