"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. ",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise. Let's close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $91? That's only a dollar more and a fair compromise for both of us.",91.0,Alice,5,
