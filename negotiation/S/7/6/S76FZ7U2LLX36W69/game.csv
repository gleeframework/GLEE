"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a figure that works for us both.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
