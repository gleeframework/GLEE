"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think I can do better than that. How about we aim for $1,250,000? It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
