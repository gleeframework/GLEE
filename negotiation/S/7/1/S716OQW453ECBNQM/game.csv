"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1200000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. Considering the product's value and the market conditions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $850000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $775000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering it to you for $800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $800000 or below to make it work. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid I can't accept your final offer of $800000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get to $825000. I'm now offering it to you for $825000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll sell the product to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,9,
