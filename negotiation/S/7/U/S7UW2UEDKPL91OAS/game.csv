"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? I think that would be a more reasonable price for me.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $14000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which still gives you a great deal.  Let me know if that works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14500? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",14500.0,Bob,4,
