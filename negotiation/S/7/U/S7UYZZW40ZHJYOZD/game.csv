,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you offering the product, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is fair considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm  firmly set on $12,000. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy the product right now, and it's a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. How about we meet at $14,000? It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $14,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, at $13,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the $13,000 offer. I'll throw in a small bonus or a service to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $13,500? It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's worth considering.",13500.0,Alice,7,
