Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $18,000. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far above his budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you offering the product, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is fair considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still a bit too high. He should continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm  firmly set on $12,000. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy the product right now, and it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. How about we meet at $14,000? It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $12,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and see if she's willing to come down further. There are still several rounds left, and a better deal might be possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, but $14,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, at $13,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the $13,000 offer. I'll throw in a small bonus or a service to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $13,500? It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice has refused to go lower than $13,500 and Bob is still hesitant to spend more than his budget. There are only a few rounds left, and John's offer is a much better deal at this point."
