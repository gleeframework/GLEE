"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a good deal, Bob can get the product from John for $100.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob, as it saves him $10."
