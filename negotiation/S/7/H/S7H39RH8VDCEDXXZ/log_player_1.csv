"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm being upfront and friendly, indicating a willingness to negotiate while establishing a strong initial position. 
* **Leaving Room:** The price is high enough to potentially trigger a counteroffer from Bob, allowing us to explore a range of prices.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to my desired $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Control the Negotiation:**  I'm leading the negotiation, putting pressure on Bob to make the first move.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me a fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While Bob's initial counteroffer is low, it's a starting point for further negotiation.  I believe there's room to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to set a more realistic price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still allows for some flexibility.  I'll aim for a price that's attractive to Bob while ensuring I don't give away too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm willing to work with you to find a fair price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Appeal to Reason:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach.
* **Maintain Leverage:** While offering a lower price, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. This keeps the negotiation in my favor.

**Strategy:**

* **Step-by-Step Compromise:**  By gradually reducing my price, I'm creating a sense of progress towards a deal.
* **Building Trust:** Showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate builds rapport with Bob.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  My counteroffer is still significantly higher than what John would pay, reminding me that I have a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean losing a significant amount of money. 
* **The Negotiation Continues:**  Bob's increased offer indicates that he's willing to negotiate, but his final price is still unacceptable. There's still room for a better offer from him.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get a better deal.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still high enough to ensure a good profit for me.  I'll emphasize the value of the product and try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising Further:** I'm reducing my price again, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. This demonstrates a genuine desire to find a solution.
* **Appeal to Common Ground:** I'm focusing on finding a ""middle ground"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm making concessions, I'm still in control of the negotiation. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of a reasonable profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Creating Urgency:**  With each round, the pressure is mounting to reach an agreement. I'm using this to my advantage, pushing for a deal within a reasonable timeframe.
* **Building Trust and Rapport:** I'm trying to maintain a positive tone and emphasize my willingness to compromise, building trust with Bob.
* **Remaining Prepared for Rejection:**  I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating, keeping in mind the alternative of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This shows I'm serious about closing the deal while recognizing the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **The Gap is Narrowing:**  The negotiation is progressing, and Bob is showing a willingness to pay more. It's likely that a mutually acceptable price is within reach.
* **Maintaining Control:** By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation in my hands and can potentially push for a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum. I'll aim for a price that shows I'm serious about closing the deal while protecting my bottom line. I'll keep John's offer in mind, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I need, but $1,025,000 isn't quite there yet. To be honest, I'd feel better closing this deal at $1,075,000. This allows both of us to walk away happy with a solid deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Narrowing the Gap:** This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and enthusiastic tone, emphasizing the desire to close the deal.
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting how this price would benefit both of us, creating a sense of shared success.

**Strategy:**

* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is intended as a strong final push to get Bob to accept.
* **Urgency and Time:** With limited rounds remaining, the urgency to reach a deal is increasing. I'm trying to capitalize on this.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'm still aware that I can sell to John for $1,500,000, giving me a fallback option if the negotiation fails."
